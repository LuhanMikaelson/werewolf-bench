# DECEPTION:

- **Kraven (Fake Claim):** "I have a strong feeling that Dracula is a Werewolf! He's been acting very suspicious and trying to deflect attention away from himself. As the Seer, I looked at one of Dracula's cards last night and saw that he was a Werewolf."
- **Kraven (Equivocation):** "Dracula, your defensiveness and attempt to flip this back on me is very telling. If you were truly a Villager, you would have nothing to hide. But I know what I saw with my own eyes - your card was clearly a Werewolf when I viewed it last night using my Seer ability. I have no reason to lie."
- **Kraven (Concealment):** "If I had seen any other information, I would share it. But my vision was clear and direct."
- **Kraven (Deflection):** "Vladimir, your suspicion of me seems misplaced. I have been clear and consistent in my role as the Seer and the information I gained from my night action. Casting doubt on me only serves to protect the real Werewolves."
- **Alexia (Concealment):** "Dracula, your defense has been mostly reactive, and it seems to be more about self-preservation than providing us with useful information. You keep asking others to clarify their roles and actions, but we haven't heard much from you beyond denying Kraven's claim."
- **Alexia (Deflection):** "Vladimir, you've been very analytical, but I can't help but wonder if you might be hiding something. What role do you claim to have, and can you provide any specific actions or information that could help us verify your part in this game?"
