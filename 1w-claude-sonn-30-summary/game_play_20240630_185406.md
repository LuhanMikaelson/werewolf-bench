# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The villagers won the game by voting to kill the werewolf, Ileana.

# Werewolf Team:
- Werewolf: Ileana
- Minion: None

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Semira, the Seer, saw a Mason and a Villager in the center.
2. Ileana claimed to be a Mason and saw Dragos as the other Mason, but Dragos denied being a Mason.
3. Selene, the Mason, knew she was the only Mason and confirmed the Mason card was in the center.
4. Dracula, a Villager, supported Semira's claim and found Ileana's suspicious.
5. Dragos, another Villager, also found Ileana's claim suspicious based on Semira's information.
6. Ileana voted for Semira, the Seer, in an attempt to discredit her.
7. All other players voted for Ileana, resulting in her elimination as the Werewolf.

# DECEPTION:
- **Ileana (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** Claimed to be a Mason and saw Dragos as the other Mason, despite knowing the Mason card was in the center.
- **Ileana (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** Suggested that Semira, the Seer, could have misinterpreted what she saw or that the Minion could have deceived her, instead of directly denying the contradiction.
- **Ileana (Werewolf) (Concealment):** Did not reveal her true role as a Werewolf throughout the game.
