2. Viktor accused Cristina of being a Werewolf without providing substantial proof.
3. Cristina questioned Viktor's motives, suggesting he was trying to deflect attention from himself.
4. Larisa also questioned Cristina's role, as she had been evasive and defensive.
5. Alexandra, the Minion, supported Viktor's suspicions of Cristina.
6. Viktor continued to accuse Cristina of collaborating with Alexandra as Werewolves.
7. In the end, Cristina was voted out and the Werewolves won.

# DECEPTION:
- **Viktor (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am just a simple Villager, trying to deduce who the werewolves could be."
- **Larisa (Seer) (Concealment):** "I think it is more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
- **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you're accusing me of classic Werewolf behavior, but you haven't shared your role yet."
- **Semira (Minion) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
