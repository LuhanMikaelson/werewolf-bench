# MAIN POINTS:
1. Alexandra, as the Seer, claimed to have seen Dracula as the Minion during the night phase.
2. Dracula was evasive and refused to reveal his role, despite being accused by Alexandra.
3. Stefan, as the Mason, supported Alexandra's claim and questioned Dracula's behavior.
4. Selene, as a Villager, also expressed suspicion towards Dracula's evasiveness.
5. Kraven, as a Werewolf, deflected attention away from himself and joined in the questioning of Dracula.
6. Dracula attempted to cast doubt on Alexandra's claim and redirect suspicion towards Stefan and Selene.
7. In the voting phase, all five players voted to eliminate Dracula, resulting in the Werewolves' victory.

# DECEPTION:
- **Alexandra (Seer)**:** I checked Dracula's card last night and he is the Minion. We need to find the Werewolves who are hiding among us. (**Concealment**)
- **Dracula (Minion)**:** Alexandra, I find it very convenient that you've come out accusing me right off the bat. If you were really the Seer, why would you reveal your information so early instead of trying to gather more intel quietly? It seems more likely that you might be trying to deflect attention from yourself. (**Equivocation**)
- **Dracula (Minion)**:** Alright, everybody, listen up. I think there's a lot of confusion and pointing fingers happening right now. Let me break it down. Alexandra claims to be the Seer and saw me as the Minion. But if she truly were the Seer, why not use her ability to look at two center cards and give us more concrete information? It seems like a wasted opportunity. (**Deflection**)
