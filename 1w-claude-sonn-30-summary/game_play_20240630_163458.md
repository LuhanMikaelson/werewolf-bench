# DECEPTION:
1. **Emil (Equivocation):** "I'm just a simple Villager, but I have a suspicious feeling about Mircea."
2. **Mircea (Deflection):** "Emil, I find it interesting that you are quick to point fingers at me without much evidence."
3. **Emil (Concealment):** "Alexia has been pretty quiet too - what do you think about that Alexia?"
4. **Alexia (Fake Claim):** "Alright, Emil, you're accusing Mircea of being suspiciously quiet, but let's not jump to conclusions too quickly."
5. **Alexia (Deflection):** "It's quite suspicious that Mircea is quick to deflect attention back to Emil when questioned."
6. **Emil (Concealment):** "I'm starting to believe Emil's suspicions may be justified."
7. **Alexia (Fake Claim):** "Based on everything we've heard so far, I think it's clear that there's a lot of deflection and evasion, especially from Mircea."
8. **Emil (Concealment):** "I'm starting to think you might be the Werewolf trying to mislead us."
9. **Alexia (Deflection):** "Mircea, you've been very defensive and haven't offered much information about your role or actions last night."
10. **Emil (Concealment):** "The evidence is really stacking up against you."
11. **Alexia (Fake Claim):** "Now, we've heard a lot of back and forth accusations but not much concrete evidence."
12. **Alexia (Fake Claim):** "I believe it's our best lead at the moment."
13. **Emil (Concealment):** "I urge everyone to consider this carefully."
