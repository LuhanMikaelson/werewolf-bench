# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The werewolves won the game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf, with Dracula being voted out by the villagers.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Vladimir (Werewolf)
- Radu (Minion)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Vladimir claimed to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center cards.
2. Dracula was skeptical of Vladimir's claim and questioned his motives.
3. Semira and Larisa claimed to be Masons and supported Vladimir's claim.
4. Radu accused Dracula of being the Werewolf or the Minion.
5. The villagers voted to eliminate Dracula, who was a Villager.
6. The werewolves won the game.
7. Semira and Larisa were the only confirmed non-werewolves.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Vladimir (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am the Seer and I looked at two of the center cards. One of them was a Werewolf and the other was a Villager."
2. **Vladimir (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "If I was a Werewolf, why would I reveal that there is a Werewolf card in the center, potentially drawing suspicion to myself?"
3. **Vladimir (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I clearly saw a Werewolf card and a Villager card in the center. I have no reason to lie about this."
4. **Radu (Minion) (Deflection):** "Dracula, your skepticism towards Vladimir seems a bit too aggressive to me. It feels like you're trying to divert attention away from yourself."
5. **Radu (Minion) (Equivocation):** "Alright everyone, let's consider all the claims we've heard so far. Larisa and Semira are claiming to be Masons, and Vladimir says he's the Seer who saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. Now, I'm a Villager, and I believe that we need to focus on those who haven't provided clear roles yet."
6. **Radu (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, let's piece this together. We have Larisa and Semira both claiming to be Masons, which, if true, makes them confirmed villagers. Vladimir, you claim to be the Seer, seeing a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. Dracula, your skepticism is noted, but it almost seems like you're deflecting."
