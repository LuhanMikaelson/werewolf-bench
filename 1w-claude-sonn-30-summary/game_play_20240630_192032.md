# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
In a game of One Night Ultimate Werewolf, a group of players try to deduce who the Werewolf is, but the Werewolf and its Minion deceive the other players to win the game.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Stefan
- Minion: Cristina

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Cristina claimed to be the Seer and saw a Drunk and a Villager in the center, but Viktor claimed to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager.
2. Stefan accused Marius of being the Werewolf without providing substantial evidence.
3. Marius suspected Viktor's claim was false because it contradicted Cristina's more detailed explanation.
4. Viktor and Alexia voted for Marius because of his evasive behavior and lack of clear answers.
5. Stefan voted for Marius to protect himself and increase the Werewolf team's odds of winning.
6. Cristina voted for Marius to protect Stefan and increase their chances of winning as the Minion.
7. Marius voted for Viktor because he believed Viktor's claim was false and made him a prime suspect.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Cristina (Minion) (Fake Claim):** "Last night, I woke up as the Seer and decided to check two of the center cards. I saw that one of them is the Drunk and the other is a Villager."
2. **Cristina (Minion) (Concealment):** "Viktor, that's quite interesting. It seems we have conflicting information here. You claim to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, whereas I saw a Drunk and a Villager. This discrepancy could mean one of us is lying or something tricky happened during the night, such as a role swap or an intentional misdirection."
3. **Cristina (Minion) (Equivocation):** "I am voting for Marius. I'm not sure why Viktor is lying, but his conflicting claim makes him a prime suspect."
4. **Stefan (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I was a simple Villager last night, so I didn't see or do anything special."
5. **Stefan (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Marius, you're awfully quiet and seem to be deflecting attention towards Viktor and Cristina. I find that suspicious."
6. **Stefan (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "Marius, your accusations towards me seem like a desperate attempt to shift blame."
