# DECEPTION:
**Stefan (Minion) (Fake Claim):**
- "I am the Seer, and last night I looked at two of the center cards. I saw one Villager and one Mason."

**Viktor (Werewolf) (Concealment):**
- "I understand the suspicion around Stefan's claim, but I think we're overlooking a crucial possibility. What if there's a Minion in play?"

**Viktor (Werewolf) (Deflection):**
- "Larisa, I find it interesting that you're questioning my motives when you haven't been very forthcoming about your own role."

**Larisa (Villager) (Equivocation):**
- "Viktor, you seem quite eager to point fingers at Cristina and Lucian, but you haven't shared your own role or any useful information."
