# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Villagers were not able to identify the Werewolf and lost the game.

# Werewolf Team:
- Semira (Werewolf)
- Dracula (Minion)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Dracula claims to be a Mason, but Mircea, the real Mason, claims the other Mason card is in the center.
2. Semira quickly supports Mircea's claim without hesitation.
3. Dracula refuses to reveal who he saw as the other Mason.
4. Mircea directly confronts Dracula, calling him a liar.
5. Dracula tries to deflect suspicion by questioning Mircea's certainty and asking for more details.
6. Semira acknowledges Mircea's suspicion but offers a reasonable explanation for her quick support.
7. Mircea presses Dracula to reveal the other Mason's identity, but Dracula evades the question.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Dracula (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am just a humble Seer, trying to deduce who the werewolves could be."
2. **Dracula (Minion) (Concealment):** "I think it is more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
3. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you're accusing me of classic Werewolf behavior, but you haven't shared your role yet."
4. **Semira (Minion) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
