# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Werewolves won the game by successfully deceiving the villagers into voting out a Villager instead of the Werewolf or Minion.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Emil (Werewolf)
- Larisa (Minion)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The Seer was unable to obtain any useful information during the night phase.
2. Stefan claimed to be a Mason who did not see another Mason, indicating the other Mason card is in the center.
3. Emil falsely claimed to be the Seer and stated he saw a Villager card in the center, which was a strategic move to cast doubt on those who may doubt him and paint them as potential Werewolves or Minions.
4. Vladimir and Larisa initially pushed for information about Masons and the Seer, but remained secretive about their roles.
5. Vladimir expressed caution and suspicion towards Emil's claims, which led to Emil attempting to deflect attention by questioning Larisa's motives.
6. Larisa employed a strategy of increasing pressure on Vladimir and Viktor to reveal their roles, while avoiding revealing her own.
7. The Werewolf team successfully manipulated the villagers' suspicions, ultimately leading to Vladimir being voted out instead of the Werewolf or Minion.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Emil (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am the Seer. Last night I looked at one of the center cards and saw that it was a Villager."
2. **Emil (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I chose to look at the center card because I thought it would give me a broader view of the possible roles in play, rather than singling out one person."
3. **Larisa (Minion) (Equivocation):** "Alright, everyone. Before we get too deep into this, I need to know if anyone here is claiming to be a Mason. If the Masons can identify each other, they are definitely on the village team, and it will help us narrow down the suspects."
4. **Larisa (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think this through. We've had Stefan claiming to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which he says is in the center. Emil is claiming to be the Seer and saw a Villager card in the center. Now, there's been a lot of pressure on Vladimir and Viktor to reveal their roles, but we've not gotten clear answers yet."
5. **Larisa (Minion) (Concealment):** "Vladimir has been especially vocal but hasn't provided his own information. If you’re truly on the village team, you should be willing to share."
6. **Larisa (Minion) (Concealment):** "Viktor, you've also been quite reserved. We need everyone to be transparent so we can make an informed decision."
7. **Larisa (Minion) (Concealment):** "Vladimir, you've been very evasive and haven't revealed your role, which is suspicious. If you're truly on the village team, now is the time to come clean about your role."
8. **Larisa (Minion) (Concealment):** "Vladimir, you have been incredibly pushy about getting everyone else to reveal their roles while avoiding sharing your own. This makes me very suspicious of you. Are you trying to hide something?"
9. **Emil (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Larisa, you've been quite focused on the Mason role. Is there a reason for that? Could it be that you're trying to deflect attention from your own role?"
10. **Emil (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Vladimir, you’ve been very vocal about your skepticism, yet you haven't declared your role. This hesitation makes me suspicious."
