# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The werewolves win after the village votes to kill Ileana, the seer.

# Werewolf Team:
- Larisa (Werewolf)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Ileana, the seer, claims to have seen the Mason and Minion cards in the center, eliminating those roles from play.
2. Marius, a villager, expresses skepticism about Ileana's claim.
3. Ileana questions Marius's motives, suggesting he might be hiding something.
4. Other villagers, Lucian and Alexia, also suspect Ileana's claim.
5. Ileana votes for Marius, while Marius, Lucian, and Alexia vote for Ileana.
6. Larisa, the werewolf, votes for Ileana.
7. The vote results in Ileana's death, and the werewolves win.

# DECEPTION:
1. Ileana's claim to have seen both the Mason and Minion cards in the center is suspicious, as no one else confirms seeing them.
2. Marius's skepticism may be an attempt to divert attention from himself.
3. Ileana's focus on questioning Marius's actions instead of providing a solid defense for her claim raises concerns.
4. Larisa's vote for Ileana helps draw suspicion away from herself as the werewolf.
5. Ileana's decision to look at two center cards instead of one player's card is unusual and may be a deceptive move.
