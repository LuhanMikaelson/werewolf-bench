7. The villagers win the game.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Mircea (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I am just a simple Villager."
2. **Mircea (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Dragos, I understand your suspicion, but I'm just trying to figure out who we can trust."
3. **Ileana (Villager) (Equivocation):** "Cristina, I find it interesting that you're pressing for information from Dragos and me, but you haven't shared your own role yet."
4. **Cristina (Mason) (Equivocation):** "Ileana, I'm willing to share my role, but I think it's important to hear from you first since you initiated the conversation."
5. **Ileana (Villager) (Equivocation):** "Cristina, your reluctance to share your role while pressing others for information is making me suspicious."
6. **Mircea (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Vladimir, your accusation is quite bold considering you haven't provided any evidence to support it."
7. **Mircea (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Vladimir, you're quick to accuse me but let's look at the facts."
8. **Ileana (Villager) (Equivocation):** "Vladimir and Cristina, your late claim as Masons is very suspicious."
9. **Vladimir (Mason) (Concealment):** "I think it's more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
10. **Semira (Minion) (Concealment):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
