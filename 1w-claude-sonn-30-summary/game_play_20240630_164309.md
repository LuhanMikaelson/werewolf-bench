5. Alexia's deceptive behavior and unwillingness to reveal all her information led to her being voted out.
6. The Villagers correctly identified and eliminated the Werewolf, winning the game.
7. Larisa's honest and consistent statements, coupled with her role as the Mason, helped the Villagers make the right decision.

# DECEPTION:
- **Alexia (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I have a strong feeling that Larisa might be a Werewolf. When I looked at her during the night phase, she seemed very nervous and was avoiding eye contact with everyone. That's definitely suspicious behavior in my book!"
- **Alexia (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I hear what you're saying Larisa, but your defensiveness is only making me more suspicious. If you were truly innocent, I think you'd be focusing more on figuring out who the real Werewolves are rather than just denying my accusation."
- **Vladimir (Minion) (Deflection):** "Larisa, you seem really quick to defend yourself against Alexia's accusation. I'm curious, what role did you have during the night phase, and can you provide any information that might help us determine who the Werewolf is?"
- **Larisa (Mason) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
