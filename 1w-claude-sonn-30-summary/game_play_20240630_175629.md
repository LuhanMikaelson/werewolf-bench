6. The vote was 4 to 1 against Emil (Werewolf), with only Selene (Villager) voting otherwise.
7. As a result, the villagers won the game.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Emil (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "I'm just a simple Villager, but I have a feeling that Dragos might be up to no good."
2. **Emil (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Selene, if you really are the Seer, could you please take a peek at one of the center cards and let us know if there's a Mason hiding there? That would clear things up quickly."
3. **Emil (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "Dragos, I appreciate your claim of being a Mason, but forgive me if I'm a bit skeptical."
4. **Emil (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Radu has been very quiet, which seems suspicious."
5. **Radu (Minion) (Equivocation):** "Alright, everyone, I can understand why Emil might be quick to point fingers, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet."
6. **Radu (Minion) (Deflection):** "Selene, if you truly did take a look at one of the center cards as the Seer, could you please share what you saw?"
7. **Emil (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I think our focus should be on Dragos and Cristina's claim for now."
8. **Radu (Minion) (Equivocation):** "Alright, everyone, let's not lose sight of the bigger picture here."
9. **Emil (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Selene, you claim to be the Seer - it's time for you to step up and reveal what you saw in the center cards."
10. **Emil (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "If I were a Werewolf, why would I be trying so hard to figure out the truth about the Mason claims?"
11. **Emil (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "The real question is, why are you so eager to accuse me without any hard evidence?"
12. **Radu (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright, Emil, you've been the most vocal and aggressive in this discussion, and it's making a lot of us suspicious."
13. **Emil (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "If you're really a Villager, why haven't you been more active in trying to find the Werewolves?"
14. **Radu (Minion) (Equivocation):** "Alright, everyone, I think it's crucial we get some definitive information to clear this confusion."
15. **Radu (Minion) (Deflection):** "Emil, you've been the most vocal and adamant about pointing fingers, and it's making me suspicious."
16. **Emil (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "Based on the discussion, I believe voting for Selene is my best move."
17. **Emil (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "She has been claiming to be the Seer but has not provided any concrete information about what she saw in the center cards, despite repeated requests from multiple players."
18. **Selene (Villager) (Concealment):** "Emil's behavior has been highly inconsistent and aggressive throughout the discussion."
19. **Selene (Villager) (Deflection):** "Dragos and Cristina's consistent claims of being Masons seem credible, and Emil's attempts to discredit them further raise suspicion."
