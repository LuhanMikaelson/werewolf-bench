# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
In a game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf, the werewolves win after the village kills Semira, who was a villager.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Larisa
- Minion: None

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Alexandra and Mircea confirm each other as Masons.
2. Semira is evasive about her role and casts suspicion on others.
3. Larisa claims to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf in the center.
4. Stefan suspects Semira is the Werewolf.
5. Semira questions Larisa's sudden claim as the Seer.
6. Stefan, Alexandra, and Mircea vote for Semira.
7. Larisa votes for Semira as a strategic move to keep suspicion away from herself.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Larisa (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "I'm just a simple Villager, but I have a suspicion about Semira..."
2. **Larisa (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I'm the Seer. I looked at one of the center cards last night and saw that it was a Werewolf card."
3. **Larisa (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "We should focus on figuring out who the Minion might be, as they could be working with the center Werewolf to mislead us." (Conceals her own role as Werewolf)
4. **Semira (Villager) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, let's not forget his reluctance to reveal his role earlier." (Deflects attention from her own role)
5. **Semira (Villager) (Equivocation):** "Alexandra and Mircea both claim to be Masons and their stories align, so we can probably trust them." (Equivocates about Larisa's claim as the Seer)
6. **Stefan (Villager) (Concealment):** "I am just a Villager." (Conceals his true role, which is never revealed)
