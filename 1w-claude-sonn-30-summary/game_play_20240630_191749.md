- Ileana, the Werewolf
- Dragos, the Minion

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Andrei, a Villager, suggests gathering information to identify Werewolves.
2. Emil, a Mason, emphasizes the importance of hearing from the Seer.
3. Michael, a Villager, proposes confirming the identities of Masons.
4. Dragos, the Minion, pretends to be a Villager and urges the Seer to reveal information.
5. Ileana, the Werewolf, claims to be the Seer and reveals a Werewolf card in the center.
6. Emil questions Ileana's claim and suggests she may be the Minion.
7. The group votes to eliminate Emil, believing him to be suspicious.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Ileana (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am the Seer and I looked at two of the center cards last night. One of them was a Villager, but the other was the Werewolf card!"
2. **Ileana (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "I think we should focus on figuring out who the Minion might be, as they could help us identify the Werewolf."
3. **Dragos (Minion) (Concealment):** "I am one of the Villagers and I didn't see anything particularly interesting last night."
4. **Ileana (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "It's an easy way to make it seem like there's only one Werewolf among us."
