# DECEPTION:
1. **Radu (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I'm the Seer and I looked at two of the center cards last night. One of them was a Werewolf!"
2. **Lucian (Minion) (Equivocation):** "I find it very interesting that Radu has come forward as the Seer and claimed to see a Werewolf in the center cards. If this is true, then we only have one Werewolf among us."
3. **Semira (Minion) (Concealment):** "Ileana, you seem very keen for someone to reveal information - do you have something to share with the group?"
4. **Lucian (Minion) (Deflection):** "Ileana, you seem very hesitant to reveal your role despite pressing others for details. This makes me suspicious of your intentions. Are you hiding something?"
5. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Lucian, earlier you mentioned that you're a Villager and you're confident there are Werewolves among us. If you didn't see anything specific during the night, what makes you so certain?"
6. **Lucian (Minion) (Deflection):** "Ileana, you've been very assertive and confident since the beginning, which is interesting. You haven't provided any solid information, just general statements about the likelihood of Werewolves. Can you explain why you're so adamant about their presence without any specific evidence?"
7. **Radu (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Ileana, you're very keen to know what the other center card was. But I already revealed seeing a Werewolf, which should be the focus. Your persistent questioning of others while avoiding revealing your own role is quite suspicious."
8. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Ileana, your continuous deflection and accusations without revealing your own role are making me very suspicious of you. Why haven't you shared your role yet?"
9. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Ileana, you've been very evasive and haven't revealed your role despite constantly questioning others. This makes me highly suspicious of you."
10. **Ileana (Villager) (Concealment):** "Semira, your constant deflection and accusations without revealing your own role are making me very suspicious of you. What exactly was your role last night?"
11. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Ileana, your evasiveness and constant questioning without revealing your own role are highly suspicious. Given the information Radu shared about seeing a Werewolf in the center and knowing there's another Mason card there, I believe you're trying to divert attention away from yourself. Are you the Werewolf?"
