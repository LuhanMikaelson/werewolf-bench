# DECEPTION:
1. **Ileana (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am the Seer and I looked at two center cards last night. One of them was a Villager, but the other one was the Werewolf card!"
2. **Ileana (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
3. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you're accusing me of classic Werewolf behavior, but you haven't shared your role yet."
4. **Semira (Minion) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
