# DECEPTION:
1. **Stefan (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am just a humble Villager, trying to deduce who the werewolves could be."
2. **Stefan (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "I think we should consider the possibility that Michael could be the Werewolf. He seems quick to point the finger at me, when I was simply wondering about Semira's eagerness to gather information."
3. **Cristina (Mason) (Deflection):** "Alright, everyone, I believe it's time to put some pressure on Semira. She was quick to ask for roles and then deflected suspicion back onto Stefan without providing much concrete information. This seems like a classic Werewolf behavior to me."
4. **Cristina (Mason) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
5. **Semira (Villager) (Concealment):** "What exactly is your role?"
6. **Andrei (Seer) (Concealment):** "I think it is more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
