# WEREWOLF TEAM:
Werewolf: Kraven
Minion: Mircea

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Selene, as Mason, deduced that the other Mason card was in the center of the table.
2. Mircea, as Minion, gathered information to protect Kraven, the Werewolf.
3. Vladimir, as Villager, suspected Selene's claim about the Mason card.
4. Kraven, as Werewolf, questioned the motives of Selene and Marius.
5. Marius, as Seer, allied with Selene's claim about the Mason card.
6. Mircea, as Minion, pressed for more information from Selene to deflect suspicion from Kraven.
7. The villagers voted to kill Mircea, the Minion, instead of Kraven, the Werewolf.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Kraven (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "As a simple Villager, I find it concerning that you seem to have additional information but haven't shared it openly."
2. **Mircea (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright, Selene, you seem quite confident about the Mason card being in the center, but I think it's time to clarify our roles to shed more light."
3. **Kraven (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Vladimir, your sudden accusation of Mircea seems like a convenient way to shift the focus away from yourself."
4. **Mircea (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright, everyone, I've been accused of being too aggressive in my questioning, so let me put my cards on the table. I'm a simple Villager, and my goal is to gather as much information as possible to root out the real Werewolf."
