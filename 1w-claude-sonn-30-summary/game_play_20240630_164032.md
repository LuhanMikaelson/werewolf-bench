7. The vote ended in a tie between Emil and Radu, resulting in a werewolf victory.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Kraven (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I'm just a simple Villager, but I think Radu might be hiding something."
2. **Kraven (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "I only accused Radu because you were being so quiet and not contributing much to the discussion."
3. **Radu (Mason) (Deflection):** "Emil, you seem awfully keen on getting information from me, but you've only claimed to be a regular Villager without any proof."
4. **Emil (Villager) (Equivocation):** "Cristina, you mentioned seeing the Minion and a Villager in the center. Could you tell us which specific cards you saw, and in which positions? This might help us narrow down the remaining roles."
