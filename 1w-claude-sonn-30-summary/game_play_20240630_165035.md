# DECEPTION:
1. **Radu (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I didn't see anything unusual last night. As the Seer, I looked at one of the center cards but it was just a regular Villager card."
2. **Kraven (Mason) (Concealment):** "Alright everyone, I'm a bit suspicious of Radu's claim. He says he saw a Villager card in the center, but that's convenient because no one can verify it."
3. **Radu (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Hold on Kraven, I don't think it's fair to single me out like that. As the Seer, I'm just trying to share the information I learned to help the village."
4. **Kraven (Mason) (Equivocation):** "Alright everyone, here's what I think. Marius claimed to be a Villager right off the bat, which could be true, but it's also a very safe claim for a Werewolf."
5. **Marius (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, I think it's important that we get explicit claims from everyone now. Lucian, you've been very evasive. What exactly is your role?"
6. **Lucian (Villager) (Fake Claim):** "Alright everyone, I think it's time to put some pressure on Kraven. He has been awfully quick to accuse Radu of being suspicious based on very little evidence."
7. **Radu (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "Kraven, your persistence in accusing me is starting to feel like a diversion tactic. I've been honest about my role as the Seer and what I saw. But you seem determined to paint me as suspicious without any concrete evidence."
8. **Lucian (Villager) (Equivocation):** "Alright everyone, I think Kraven's quick accusations without much evidence are very suspicious. He seems to be trying to deflect attention away from himself."
9. **Radu (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "I find it interesting that Lucian keeps deflecting attention back to Kraven whenever he's asked about his role. Lucian, you've been dancing around the question all day."
