## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
In a game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf, the Werewolves won after the villagers voted to kill the Minion.

## WEREWOLF TEAM:
* Werewolf: Kraven
* Minion: Radu

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Kraven claimed to be the Seer and saw the Drunk in the center, while Radu claimed to see a Villager.
2. Michael, as the only Mason, knew one Mason card was in the center, supporting Radu's claim.
3. Radu's initial proactive behavior and push for information seemed more in line with a Villager's role.
4. Kraven's detailed Seer claim and contradiction with Radu's raised suspicion.
5. Michael suspected Kraven as the Werewolf due to his conflicting claim and detailed but potentially fabricated story.
6. Kraven, as the Werewolf, cast suspicion on Michael by questioning the source of his Mason card information.
7. In the vote, all players voted for Radu, resulting in the Werewolves' victory.

## DECEPTION:
1. Kraven falsely claimed to be the Seer and saw the Drunk in the center to mislead the villagers and protect himself.
2. Radu, as the Minion, supported Kraven's false claim and accused Emil of being a Werewolf to divert suspicion from Kraven.
3. Kraven questioned Michael's source of information about the Mason card to shift focus away from his own suspicious claim.
4. Radu's initial proactive behavior and push for information could be seen as a deceptive tactic to gain trust and appear innocent.
5. Kraven's detailed but conflicting claim about seeing the Drunk in the center was likely fabricated to support his false Seer role.
