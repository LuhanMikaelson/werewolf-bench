# DECEPTION:
1. **Radu (Minion) (Fake Claim):** "Alright everyone, let's get things moving! I think it's crucial we start by figuring out if anyone has any solid information from the night phase. I'll start by saying that I checked one of the center cards and I saw a Villager card there."
2. **Kraven (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "That's a fair question, Emil. I'm actually the Seer. Last night, I looked at one of the center cards and saw that it was the Drunk. This means the Drunk is not in play, and we have one less role to worry about."
3. **Kraven (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Radu, you say you saw a Villager in the center, but I'm the Seer and I know for a fact that the Drunk card is there. One of us must be lying or mistaken. Can you explain this discrepancy?"
4. **Radu (Minion) (Deflection):** "Kraven, I find it interesting that you claim to be the Seer and saw the Drunk in the center. If that's true, then there should be no Drunk in play. But you also seem very keen to accuse Emil without much evidence. It makes me wonder if youâ€™re trying to deflect suspicion away from yourself."
