# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Alexia, the Werewolf, successfully deceives the villagers into voting out Dracula, the Villager, leading to the Werewolf team's victory.

# Werewolf Team:
- Werewolf: Alexia
- Minion: Larisa

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Alexia, as the Werewolf, claims to be the Seer and falsely states seeing a Werewolf card in the center, implying there is only one Werewolf.
2. Larisa, as the Minion, supports Alexia's claim by deflecting attention from her and accusing Dracula.
3. Dracula, as the Villager, raises suspicions by being evasive and not claiming a role.
4. Mircea and Ileana, as Masons, confirm each other's roles but struggle to identify the Werewolf.
5. Larisa continues to deflect suspicion from Alexia and accuses Dracula, who is eventually voted out.
6. The Werewolf team wins due to Alexia's deceptive claim and the villagers' inability to correctly identify the Werewolf.
7. Dracula, the Villager, is killed due to the villagers' suspicions.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Alexia (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am the Seer and I looked at two of the center cards last night. One of them was a Villager, but the other one was a Werewolf! So there is definitely at least one Werewolf among us."
2. **Larisa (Minion) (Deflection):** "Can anyone else confirm any other roles? Larisa, what role do you claim to be?"
3. **Larisa (Minion) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
