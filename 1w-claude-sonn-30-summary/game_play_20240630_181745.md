# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The villagers win by voting out the Werewolf, Ileana.

# Werewolf Team:
- Werewolf: Ileana
- Minion: Kraven

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Viktor, the Seer, saw two Villager cards in the center.
2. Ileana, claiming to be the Seer, said she saw the Minion card in the center.
3. Alexandra, a Mason, found Ileana's claim suspicious because it contradicted Viktor's.
4. Kraven, the Minion, supported Viktor's claim and cast doubt on Ileana.
5. Andrei, a Villager, believed Ileana was lying and voted against her.
6. Ileana tried to deflect suspicion by voting for Andrei.
7. The group voted 4-1 to kill Ileana, who was revealed to be the Werewolf.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Ileana (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am the Seer. Last night I looked at one of the center cards and saw that it was the Minion."
2. **Ileana (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "The Minion card I saw could have been swapped out by the Drunk."
3. **Ileana (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Could she be the Werewolf trying to throw us off the trail?"
4. **Ileana (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I find it very interesting that you're so quick to accuse me of being a Werewolf or the Minion, when you haven't even claimed a role yourself!"
5. **Ileana (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Is there something you're not telling us, Kraven? Are you perhaps working with the Werewolves?"
6. **Kraven (Minion) (Deflection):** "I'm curious, what's your role, and do you have any information that could help us untangle this mess?"
