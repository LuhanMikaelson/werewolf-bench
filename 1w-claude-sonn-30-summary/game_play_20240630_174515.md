# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Werewolf and Minion successfully deceived the village team by making false claims and diverting suspicion, leading to the elimination of three Villagers and the Werewolf's victory.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Mircea
- Minion: Marius

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Marius (Minion) falsely claimed to be the Seer and accused Emil (Villager) of being a Werewolf, creating confusion and diverting attention from the actual Werewolf.
2. Mircea (Werewolf) claimed to be a Mason and refused to reveal the other Mason, adding to the confusion and making it difficult to determine who was telling the truth.
3. Radu (Seer) saw that two center cards were Villager and Mason, but kept this information secret, making it harder for the village team to verify Marius's claim.
4. Larisa (Villager) questioned Marius's actions and raised concerns about his claim, but her suspicions were not enough to sway the majority.
5. Emil (Villager) also questioned Marius's claim and suggested he might be a Werewolf or Minion, but his arguments were not strong enough to convince the others.
6. Marius and Mircea successfully deflected suspicion onto Emil, leading to his elimination.
7. The remaining Villagers, Radu and Larisa, voted for Marius, but it was too late as the Werewolf team had already secured the majority.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Marius (Minion) (Fake Claim):** "I'm the Seer, and I saw that Emil is a Werewolf."
2. **Mircea (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I'm a Mason, and I can't reveal the identity of the other Mason."
3. **Marius (Minion) (Deflection):** "We need to focus on Emil's suspicious behavior instead of Mircea's claim."
4. **Mircea (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "It's not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
