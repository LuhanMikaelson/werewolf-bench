# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Werewolves won a game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf with Alexandra as the Werewolf and Semira as the Minion, killing Viktor.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
Werewolf: Alexandra
Minion: Semira

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Semira initiated the discussion but only claimed to be a Mason after Michael, the Seer, revealed information.
2. Michael saw the Minion and Villager cards in the center, which contradicted Semira's claim that one of the Mason cards was in the center.
3. Viktor was suspicious of Semira's late claim and Michael's inconsistent statements.
4. Alexandra accused Viktor of being the Werewolf without solid evidence, attempting to deflect suspicion from herself.
5. Cristina found both Semira and Alexandra's behavior suspicious, ultimately voting for Viktor.
6. Michael voted for Semira due to her inconsistent statements and late Mason claim.
7. Viktor, Alexandra, and Semira received three, one, and one votes respectively, with Viktor being eliminated.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Semira (Mason) (False Claim):** "I am just a humble Seer, trying to deduce who the werewolves could be."
2. **Semira (Mason) (Concealment):** "I think it is more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
3. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you're accusing me of classic Werewolf behavior, but you haven't shared your role yet."
4. **Semira (Minion) (Concealment):** "I know the other Mason card is in the center."
5. **Alexandra (Werewolf) (False Claim):** "I am just a simple Villager, but I have a feeling that Viktor might be hiding something."
6. **Alexandra (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "I think you might be the Minion trying to protect Michael, the Werewolf!"
7. **Alexandra (Werewolf) (False Claim):** "Viktor, you're being awfully defensive for someone who claims to be innocent."
8. **Alexandra (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Why are you so sure I'm hiding something, especially since you claim to be just a Villager?"
9. **Alexandra (Werewolf) (False Claim):** "I think you're the Werewolf trying to lead us astray with all your vague accusations and questions!"
10. **Viktor (Villager) (False Claim):** "I am voting for Alexandra."
11. **Cristina (Villager) (False Claim):** "I am voting for Viktor."
12. **Michael (Seer) (False Claim):** "I am voting for Semira."
