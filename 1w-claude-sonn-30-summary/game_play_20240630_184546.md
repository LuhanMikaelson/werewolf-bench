# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: 
The villagers win after four players vote to kill Radu, the werewolf.

# Werewolf Team: 
- Radu (Werewolf)

# MAIN POINTS: 
1. Alexandra claims to be the Seer and saw the Mason and Minion in the center. 
2. Kraven is the lone Mason. 
3. Marius and Alexia are Villagers. 
4. Radu repeatedly casts suspicion on others, particularly Alexia, without providing solid reasoning or concrete information about his own role. 
5. Radu questions Alexandra's Seer claim even though her claims align with Kraven's Mason claim. 
6. Radu votes for Alexandra, claiming her Seer claim is suspicious and that she and Marius could be working together as the Werewolf and Minion pair. 
7. The other four players vote for Radu, resulting in his death and the villagers' victory. 

# DECEPTION: 

1. **Radu (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am just a simple Villager trying to help us find the real threats."
2. **Radu (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "If I was a Werewolf, why would I be trying so hard to figure out who the Seer and Minion are? That would only put a target on my own back."
3. **Radu (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I hate to say it, but I'm starting to wonder if you and Alexandra might be the real Werewolf and Minion pair trying to mislead us."
4. **Radu (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Marius, your defense of Alexandra seems very suspicious to me. If you're truly just a Villager, why are you so quick to back up her story and accuse me?"
5. **Radu (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I'm voting for Alexandra because her Seer claim seems very suspicious. If she was really the Seer, she should have used her power to look at player cards and try to identify the Werewolves directly."
