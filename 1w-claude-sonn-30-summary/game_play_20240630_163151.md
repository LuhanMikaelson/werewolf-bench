# DECEPTION:
1. **Alexia (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I woke up as the Seer. Last night, I looked at one of the center cards and saw that it was a Villager."
2. **Alexia (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I didn't share my information earlier because I wanted to see how the discussion would unfold."
3. **Alexia (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Mircea has been the most aggressive in questioning my claim as the Seer and trying to discredit the information I provided."
4. **Mircea (Villager) (Equivocation):** "I'm not buying your claim as the Seer. If you were really the Seer, you should have shared your information much earlier."
5. **Michael (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and I think it's time to address the elephant in the room. There's been a lot of finger-pointing and accusations, but we need to focus on the facts."
