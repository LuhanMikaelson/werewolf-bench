# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The villagers win by voting for and killing Radu, the werewolf.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Radu (Werewolf)
- Semira (Minion)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Radu claims to be the Seer and sees a Werewolf card in the center, which contradicts Andrei's claim of seeing a Villager and a Mason.
2. Radu aggressively pushes his claim and accuses others of lying, which raises suspicion about his intentions.
3. Selene, as a Mason, confirms that one Mason card is in the center, aligning with Andrei's claim.
4. Mircea, Alexandra, and Selene all express suspicion of Radu's behavior and claims.
5. Radu attempts to shift blame onto Andrei and discredit his Seer claim.
6. Andrei maintains his claim and accuses Radu of lying to protect himself as a Werewolf.
7. The villagers vote for and kill Radu, revealing him as the Werewolf.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Radu (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I'm the Seer and I looked at two of the center cards last night. One of them was a Villager, but the other one was the Werewolf card! So we know there's only one Werewolf among the players."
2. **Radu (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I find your accusation very suspicious. Why would you claim to be the Seer when I already said I was?"
3. **Radu (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "If I was actually a Werewolf, why would I openly claim that a Werewolf card is in the center? That would only cast more suspicion on myself!"
4. **Radu (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Alexandra, you've been awfully quiet so far. As someone claiming to be the real Seer, I find that very suspicious. Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to lay low and avoid drawing attention to yourself?"
5. **Radu (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Mircea, you've been rather quiet as well. As the one claiming to be the real Seer, I find it concerning that you haven't shared any information about what you saw."
6. **Radu (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Selene, your insistence on there being a Werewolf in the center just doesn't add up. Given that Andrei's information aligns with my own knowledge about the Masons, and considering how aggressively you're trying to deflect suspicion onto others, I strongly believe you're either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf."
7. **Radu (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I'm telling the truth about what I saw because I want to help the Village team win."
8. **Radu (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "Andrei, I find it very suspicious that you jumped in so quickly to contradict my claim of being the Seer. It's clear you have an agenda to discredit me and make the group doubt my information."
9. **Radu (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I've been actively sharing information and trying to help the group this entire time."
10. **Radu (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Alexandra, your accusations are completely baseless! I've been actively sharing information and trying to help the group this entire time."
11. **Radu (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I'm telling you the truth because I want the Village team to win."
