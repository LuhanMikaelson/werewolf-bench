# ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The werewolves win the game by deceiving the villagers and successfully eliminating the Seer.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Ileana (Werewolf)
- Michael (Minion)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Radu claimed to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center but refused to specify the exact position of the Mason card.
2. Cristina repeatedly pressed Radu for details about the Mason card's position without sharing any concrete information about her own role.
3. Michael pointed out inconsistencies in the claims of both Radu and Ileana, but did not provide any concrete information about his own role.
4. Ileana claimed to have possibly seen a Villager card in the center, but expressed uncertainty about her observation.
5. Marius requested clarification from Radu and Ileana about their observations but did not provide any concrete information about his own role.
6. The villagers voted to eliminate Radu, who turned out to be the Seer, allowing the werewolves to win the game.
7. Michael's deflection tactics and lack of concrete information made him a potential suspect.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Ileana (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I think I may have seen a Villager card in the center during the night phase."
2. **Ileana (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "I did think I saw a Villager card in the center, but it was hard to be certain in the darkness. The card looked like it had the Villager symbol on it, but I couldn't swear to it."
3. **Radu (Seer) (Concealment):** "I saw two cards in the center: one Villager and one Mason. That means we should have one Mason among us if the other Mason card is in play. Cristina, do you have any other information to share?"
4. **Radu (Seer) (Equivocation):** "Getting input from Marius could help us gather more information or possibly catch a lie. His silence needs to be addressed, and pressing for his details might reveal something useful for identifying the Werewolves."
5. **Cristina (Villager) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, I think it's time we start narrowing things down. Michael, you've been pretty quiet this whole time and only chimed in to point out inconsistencies. Do you have any information about your role or something you might have seen during the night phase?"
6. **Michael (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright Cristina, you're pressing Radu hard about the positions of the cards, but we haven't heard anything concrete from you about your own role. If you're so sure that Radu is suspicious, why don't you tell us what you did or saw during the night? It feels like you're deflecting."
7. **Michael (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, we've been going around in circles a bit here, but I think it's time we address something that's been bothering me. Cristina has been very insistent on getting specific details from Radu about the Mason card, yet she hasn't disclosed anything concrete about her own role or observations. This deflection tactic is highly suspicious."
