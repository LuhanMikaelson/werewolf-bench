# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Dracula claims to be the Seer and Ileana claims to be the Seer, but the villagers vote out Dracula and the Werewolves win.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
Werewolf: Ileana
Minion: Michael

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Ileana, the Werewolf, claims to be the Seer and accuses Dracula of being the Minion.
2. Dracula, the Seer, claims to have seen two center cards: a Mason and Villager.
3. Marius and Radu, the Villagers, question Dracula's delayed response and inconsistencies in his story.
4. Ileana's consistent and detailed claims lead the villagers to believe she is the true Seer.
5. All four villagers vote for Dracula, believing him to be the Minion or a Werewolf.
6. Dracula is voted out, and the Werewolves win the game.
7. Michael, the Minion, supports Ileana's claim to eliminate a village member and protect the Werewolf.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Ileana (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am just a humble Seer, trying to deduce who the werewolves could be."
2. **Dracula (Seer) (Concealment):** "I think it is more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
3. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you're accusing me of classic Werewolf behavior, but you haven't shared your role yet."
4. **Semira (Minion) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
