# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The One Night: Ultimate Werewolf game was won by the villagers after they voted to kill Andrei, who was the werewolf.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Andrei (Werewolf)
- Semira (Minion)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Andrei, claiming to be the drunk, accused Semira of being a werewolf with little evidence.
2. Ileana claimed to be the seer and revealed the Minion and Villager cards in the center, which was consistent with her role.
3. Andrei's explanation of his drunk ability was inconsistent with the game's rules.
4. Semira was consistently evasive and refused to claim a role, making her appear suspicious.
5. Mircea was quiet and evasive, but his behavior was not as suspicious as Andrei's or Semira's.
6. Marius, the mason, voted for Andrei based on his inconsistent explanations and behavior.
7. Andrei was voted out and killed, resulting in a victory for the villagers.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Andrei (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am just a humble Seer, trying to deduce who the werewolves could be."
2. **Andrei (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I had a quick peek at a center card, but I couldn't fully register the role at the time due to my drunken state."
3. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you're accusing me of classic Werewolf behavior, but you haven't shared your role yet."
4. **Semira (Minion) (Concealment):** "I have no special abilities or information. If I was a Werewolf, don't you think I would have been more aggressive in trying to mislead everyone?"
5. **Semira (Minion) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
