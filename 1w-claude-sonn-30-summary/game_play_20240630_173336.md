# DECEPTION:
- **Semira (Minion) (Fake Claim):** "Actually, I have some interesting information to share. I'm the Seer, and during the night, I looked at one of the center cards. I saw that one of the center cards is a Mason. This means that there's only one Mason among us, and possibly two Werewolves or another special role we need to be cautious of."
- **Ileana (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "Interesting, so you're saying there's a Mason in the center, Semira? Well, since you claimed to be the Seer, I suppose I should share what I saw. I woke up as the Mason last night and I didn't see another Mason, which means the other Mason must be in the center, just like you said. This confirms that you're telling the truth about being the Seer."
- **Ileana (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Selene and Cristina, you both claim to be Villagers, but I find that a bit suspicious. It's unlikely that we have that many Villagers in the game. One of you might be the Minion or even the other Werewolf trying to throw us off track. I think we need to dig deeper and figure out who's not being entirely truthful here."
- **Semira (Minion) (Equivocation):** "Selene, your claim that the other Mason card is in the center contradicts what I saw as the Seer. Ileana has already confirmed my claim. Are you sure you're not the Minion or a Werewolf trying to mislead us?"
- **Ileana (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Selene, I understand your suspicion, but I can assure you that I am indeed the Mason. If you're also claiming to be the Mason, then one of us must be lying. Since Semira confirmed seeing a Mason card in the center, it's more likely that you're the one who's not being truthful. Perhaps you're trying to cast doubt on me to protect yourself. I think we need to take a closer look at your role."
- **Ileana (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "Selene, I understand your suspicion, but Semira's claim as the Seer backs up my role as the Mason. If you're so sure that the other Mason is in the center, then how do you explain Semira seeing the same thing? I think you're trying to cast doubt on me to protect yourself. You might be the real Werewolf here, attempting to mislead us by contradicting the Seer's information. We need to take a closer look at your claims and motives."
