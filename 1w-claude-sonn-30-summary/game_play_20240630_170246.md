# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The werewolf lost a game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf to the villagers by a vote of 4-1.

# Werewolf Team:
- Werewolf: Cristina
- Minion: No minion

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Cristina, the Werewolf, accused Dragos of being a Werewolf based on his body language and evasiveness, but Dragos denied the accusations and claimed Cristina was trying to deflect suspicion.
2. Marius and Andrei claimed to be Masons and trusted each other, which reduced the likelihood of them being Werewolves.
3. Alexia remained relatively quiet during the discussion, providing little information to help identify the Werewolves.
4. Cristina continued to press Dragos to reveal his role, while Dragos maintained his innocence and accused Cristina of being the Werewolf.
5. In the end, all four other players voted to kill Cristina, believing her to be the Werewolf, and the villagers won the game.
6. Cristina's aggressive accusations, lack of evidence, and evasive behavior ultimately led to her being voted out as the Werewolf.
7. The Masons, Marius and Andrei, played a key role in identifying and voting out the Werewolf, Cristina.

# DECEPTION:
1. Cristina falsely accused Dragos of being a Werewolf based on flimsy evidence to deflect suspicion from herself.
2. Cristina claimed to be a Villager but her aggressive behavior and lack of evidence suggested otherwise.
3. Cristina repeatedly pressed Dragos to reveal his role, while she herself refused to provide any information about her own role.
4. Cristina attempted to sow confusion by suggesting that Marius could be lying about being a Mason, despite having no evidence to support this claim.
5. Cristina's persistent attempts to shift the blame onto others, while providing no evidence to support her accusations, were ultimately her downfall.
