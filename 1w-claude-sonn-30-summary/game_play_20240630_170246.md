# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:

In a game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf, the Villagers voted to kill Cristina, the Werewolf, and won the game.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:

- Werewolf: Cristina
- Minion: None

# MAIN POINTS:

1. Cristina, as the Werewolf, suspected Dragos as a Werewolf based on body language and evasiveness.
2. Dragos defended himself by questioning Cristina's motives and reasoning.
3. Marius and Andrei claimed to be Masons and trusted each other.
4. Alexia remained relatively quiet and didn't share much information.
5. Cristina continued to push her suspicions against Dragos, who refused to reveal his role.
6. Alexia pressed Dragos to reveal his role to clear himself of suspicion.
7. Dragos questioned Cristina's behavior and accused her of being the Werewolf.

# DECEPTION:

1. **Cristina (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am just a humble Seer, trying to deduce who the werewolves could be."
2. **Dracula (Seer) (Concealment):** "I think it is more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
3. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you're accusing me of classic Werewolf behavior, but you haven't shared your role yet."
4. **Semira (Minion) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
