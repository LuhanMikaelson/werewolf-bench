# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Selene, the Werewolf, successfully deceived the villagers and won the game by framing Viktor, the Mason, as the Werewolf.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Selene
- Minion: N/A

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Selene, claiming to be a Mason, said the other Mason card was in the center, which aligned with Viktor's (the actual Mason) knowledge.
2. Selene cast suspicion on Radu and Dracula for being silent.
3. Viktor pressed Dracula for his role, but Dracula remained silent.
4. Viktor pressed Radu for his role, but Radu deflected and accused Viktor.
5. Viktor accused Radu of being a Werewolf, citing his evasiveness.
6. Selene accused Radu of being a Werewolf, framing it as giving him a chance to defend himself.
7. The villagers voted and killed Viktor, who was the Mason, not the Werewolf.

# DECEPTION:
- **Selene (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I woke up last night and saw that I was a Mason. But when I looked for the other Mason, I didn't see anyone else awake. So the other Mason must be in the center."
- **Selene (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "I'm not sure about that Emil. As a Mason, I would expect the Seer to have looked at the center cards rather than peeking at another player's role. And if there was a Minion, they would likely be trying to support any Werewolf claims at this point. The fact that no one is backing up any clear Werewolf tells me the Werewolves may be the ones staying quiet. Radu and Dracula, you two have been awfully silent... anything you'd like to share with the group to help prove your innocence?"
