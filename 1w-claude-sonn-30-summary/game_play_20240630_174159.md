# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The village team lost to the werewolves when Larisa, who was the Seer, was voted and killed.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
Selene: Werewolf

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The seer, Larisa, claimed to have seen two Villagers in the center.
2. Selene, who claimed to be the Seer, said she saw a Werewolf and a Villager.
3. Larisa questioned Selene's claim, saying it was illogical for a Seer to risk being caught in a lie.
4. The Masons, Ileana and Alexia, found Selene's claim more consistent with the odds and roles in play.
5. Kraven, a Villager, also suspected Larisa because her claim contradicted Selene's.
6. Selene accused Larisa of being the Minion, trying to protect a hidden Werewolf.
7. The vote was 4-1 in favor of killing Larisa, with only Selene voting against.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Selene (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "Last night I looked at two of the center cards and saw a Werewolf and a Villager."
2. **Selene (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I know for a fact that's not true. I looked at one of the center cards myself and it was the other Werewolf card."
3. **Selene (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "I understand your concern, but I can assure you that I am telling the truth. I am the real Seer and I did see a Werewolf card in the center."
4. **Selene (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "If she's telling the truth, then why would I falsely claim to be the Seer? The Seer is on the village team, so if I was actually a Werewolf or Minion, it would make no sense for me to claim a role that goes against my own team."
