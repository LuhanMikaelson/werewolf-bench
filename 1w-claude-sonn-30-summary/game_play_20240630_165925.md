# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Werewolves won the game by killing Emil.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Semira (Werewolf)
- Mircea (Minion)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Semira (Werewolf) claimed to be a Mason and saw another player as a Mason, but Emil (Mason) denied being the other Mason.
2. Kraven (Seer) saw the Mason and Minion cards in the center, contradicting both Semira and Emil's claims of being Masons.
3. Emil (Mason) insisted he was the only Mason and questioned others without providing clear evidence.
4. Semira (Werewolf) accused Selene (Villager) of being a Werewolf to shift suspicion away from herself and onto others.
5. Selene (Villager) suspected Kraven (Seer) of being a Werewolf or Minion due to his convenient choice of checking the center cards.
6. Mircea (Villager) voted for Emil (Mason) based on the conflicting claims and Kraven's observation of the center cards.
7. The village voted to kill Emil (Mason), and the Werewolves won the game.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Semira (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I'm pretty sure I'm a Mason. I woke up last night and saw someone else, but I don't want to say who just yet."
2. **Emil (Mason) (Concealment):** "I think it is more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
3. **Semira (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Emil, I understand your suspicion, but I assure you I am a Mason. I clearly remember waking up and seeing another player's card. If you are truly the only Mason as you claim, then you should have no problem revealing who the other Mason is. The fact that you haven't makes me question your claim. I suspect you might be a Werewolf trying to cast doubt on me to protect yourself."
4. **Semira (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I had a clear reason for not revealing the other Mason immediately - I wanted to protect them from being targeted by the Werewolves or the Minion."
