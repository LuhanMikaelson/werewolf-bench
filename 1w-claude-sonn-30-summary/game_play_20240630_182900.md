# DECEPTION:
- **Larisa (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am the Seer and I looked at two of the center cards last night. One of them was a Werewolf! So there is definitely a Werewolf among us, but it's not me."
- **Larisa (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "The other center card I saw was a Villager. But I'm more concerned about the Minion - they know who the Werewolf is and will be trying to protect them. I have a suspicion that Emil might be the Minion. He's been awfully quiet so far."
- **Larisa (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Emil, you're quick to point the finger at me, but I still think you're acting suspicious. If you were really a Villager, why wouldn't you want to help find the Minion?"
- **Larisa (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Selene, you've been very quiet this whole time. What are you thinking about all this?"
- **Emil (Minion) (Equivocation):** "Why are we so focused on finding the Minion right now? If Larisa really saw a Werewolf card in the center, doesn't that mean there's only one Werewolf among us?"
- **Emil (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, let's not forget the bigger picture here. If Larisa truly saw a Werewolf card in the center and claims to be the Seer, it means there's only one Werewolf among us. But her immediate focus on the Minion raises red flags for me."
- **Emil (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, we've been going back and forth with a lot of accusations, but we need to start seeing some concrete roles. Selene, you've been pretty quiet and only chimed in with suspicions recently. If you want to convince us you're not hiding anything, it's time to reveal your role. What role do you claim to have?"
- **Vladimir (Mason) (Deflection):** "Larisa, you are trying to deflect suspicion by focusing on the Minion rather than the Werewolf."
