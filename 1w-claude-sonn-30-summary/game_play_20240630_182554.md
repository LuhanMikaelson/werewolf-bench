# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Werewolves win by fooling the Villagers into voting out an innocent Villager instead of the Werewolf.

# Werewolf Team:
- Werewolf: Lucian
- Minion: None

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Ileana and Vladimir are confirmed Masons.
2. Mircea and Marius have claimed to be Villagers.
3. Mircea has been evasive and has not claimed a role.
4. Lucian has been adamant about being a Villager, but has provided no additional evidence.
5. Mircea is voted out and the Werewolves win.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Lucian (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am a simple Villager, just trying to help root out the evil that threatens our peaceful village."
2. **Lucian (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Ileana, that's a bold claim. If you and Vladimir are truly Masons, then one of Marius, Mircea or myself must be lying. I find it strange that you're so quick to accuse the rest of us without any real evidence. Perhaps you're trying to divert attention away from yourself?"
3. **Lucian (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Marius, you seem quite keen to cast suspicion on me, but you haven't revealed your own role. If you're truly innocent, what do you claim to be?"
4. **Lucian (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Mircea, your reluctance to claim a role is very concerning. An innocent player should have no problem being forthright. I'm just a simple Villager trying to protect our community. Could it be that you're actually the Werewolf, trying to avoid suspicion by staying quiet and letting the rest of us argue?"
