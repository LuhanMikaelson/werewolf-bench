# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The werewolves win as the villagers vote to kill the seer.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Lucian
- Minion: None

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Lucian (Werewolf) immediately accuses Dracula (Seer) without evidence, attempting to deflect suspicion.
2. Kraven (Mason) claims to know the location of the other Mason card, aligning with Dracula's (Seer) claim, which raises suspicion.
3. Emil (Villager) points out Dracula's (Seer) delayed reveal of information, casting doubt on his trustworthiness.
4. Viktor (Villager) also questions Dracula's (Seer) behavior, suggesting a potential Werewolf affiliation.
5. Lucian (Werewolf) attempts to shift suspicion to Emil (Villager) by claiming he is suspiciously quiet.
6. Emil (Villager) votes for Dracula (Seer) due to his suspicious behavior and alignment with Kraven (Mason).
7. The majority of the villagers vote to kill Dracula (Seer), resulting in a Werewolf victory.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Lucian (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I have a strong suspicion that Dracula might be a Werewolf. He's been unusually quiet and seems to be avoiding eye contact with everyone."
2. **Dracula (Seer) (Concealment):** "I think it is more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
3. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you're accusing me of classic Werewolf behavior, but you haven't shared your role yet."
4. **Semira (Minion) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
