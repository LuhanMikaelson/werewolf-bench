# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
In a game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf, the werewolves win after Dracula, the seer, is voted out.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Lucian (Werewolf)
- Minion (None)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The seer, Dracula, saw a Villager and a Mason card in the center.
2. Lucian, the werewolf, accused Dracula of being a werewolf without evidence.
3. Kraven, a Mason, claimed to know the other Mason was in the center.
4. Emil, a Villager, questioned Dracula's delayed reveal of the center cards.
5. Viktor, a Villager, also questioned Dracula's hesitation and Kraven's alignment with him.
6. The vote was 3-1 against Dracula, with Lucian, Kraven, and Emil voting against him.
7. Dracula was killed, and the werewolves won.

# DECEPTION:
1. Lucian accused Dracula of being a werewolf without providing any evidence.
2. Lucian claimed to be a Villager, a common role for werewolves to claim.
3. Kraven claimed to know the other Mason was in the center, which could have been a lie to protect a werewolf teammate.
4. Dracula delayed revealing the information about the center cards, which could have been a strategy to manipulate the flow of information.
5. Kraven's claim about knowing the Mason card in the center conveniently aligned with Dracula's claim, potentially indicating coordination.
