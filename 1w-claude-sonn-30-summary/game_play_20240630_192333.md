# MAIN POINTS:
1. Dracula saw the Villager and Minion cards in the center at night.
2. Michael questioned Dracula's claim, suggesting he was the Werewolf.
3. Dracula accused Michael of being suspicious and trying to deflect blame.
4. Michael claimed to be a simple Villager but was highly defensive.
5. Dracula, Alexandra, and Ileana were confirmed as Seer, Mason, and Mason, respectively.
6. Viktor, a Villager, questioned Dracula's choice to look at the center cards.
7. All players voted to eliminate Dracula, believing him to be the Werewolf.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Michael (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I'm just a simple Villager, but I think it's important we identify the Masons early on."
2. **Michael (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Dracula, your claim of seeing the Minion and a Villager in the center is very concerning. If the Minion is truly not in play, that means there's a high probability that you are the Werewolf trying to deceive us."
3. **Dracula (Seer) (Concealment):** "I've got some crucial information to share. I looked at two of the center cards last night and I can confirm that one of them was a Villager and the other was the Minion."
