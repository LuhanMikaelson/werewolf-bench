# DECEPTION:
- **Andrei (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am just a simple Villager, Vladimir. I don't have any special powers or information."
- **Andrei (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I hear what you're saying Vladimir, but I'm still not convinced."
- **Andrei (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "I'm just a simple Villager, but even I know that the Werewolves will say anything to avoid suspicion."
- **Semira (Seer) (Equivocation):** "Alright everyone, let's break this down step by step. If Vladimir and Semira both claim to have seen the same center cards, but only one of them can be the real Seer, it's likely one of them is lying."
- **Semira (Seer) (Equivocation):** "Dragos, you've been quite neutral so far, but we need to hear more from you. What role do you claim to have and why did you choose to stay quiet until now?"
- **Vladimir (Minion) (Fake Claim):** "Alright, everyone, let's get this started. I've noticed something interesting. I am actually the Seer, and I decided to check two cards in the center last night."
- **Vladimir (Minion) (Concealment):** "Alright, Andrei, you seem pretty defensive. It's understandable, given how tense this game can get. But if you're just a simple Villager, then surely you won't mind sharing who you think could be the Werewolf among us?"
- **Vladimir (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright, everyone, let's think logically here. If both of us supposedly saw the same two center cards and they are indeed a Villager and a Mason, that means both of us are either telling the truth or one of us is lying. Since I know what I saw, itâ€™s clear to me that you might be the one trying to mislead everyone."
