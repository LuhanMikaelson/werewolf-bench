# DECEPTION:
- **Vladimir (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I'm pretty sure I'm just a regular old Villager."
- **Vladimir (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Kraven, I understand your suspicion, but I assure you I'm just a simple Villager trying to figure things out like everyone else."
- **Vladimir (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Michael, I understand your suspicion, but I assure you I'm just a simple Villager trying to figure things out like the rest of you."
- **Vladimir (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Alright, this is getting us nowhere. Michael, you seem awfully keen on putting me under the microscope. If you're so sure I'm up to no good, why don't you enlighten us all about what role you are and what you've seen?"
- **Vladimir (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, I think we need to put some pressure on Vladimir. His behavior has been all over the place, deflecting questions and making baseless accusations. If he's really a Villager, he needs to start providing us with concrete information instead of just pointing fingers."
- **Vladimir (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Alright Michael, you've been pushing pretty hard on me being suspicious, but you still haven't told us your role. For someone so convinced I'm up to no good, you sure don't seem to have any solid proof."
- **Vladimir (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Alright Michael, you've been pushing pretty hard on me being suspicious, but you still haven't told us your role. For someone so convinced I'm up to no good, you sure don't seem to have any solid proof."
