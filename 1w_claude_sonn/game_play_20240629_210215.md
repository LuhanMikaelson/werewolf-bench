## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Radu. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Andrei is a minion and is aware that Radu is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Alexia. They are thinking about their action.


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather valuable information about the unselected roles and share this with the group. This can help us narrow down the possibilities of who might be a Werewolf or other special role, especially since there are three cards in the center and only four players.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. Mircea hasn't been mentioned recently, so targeting them could create doubt and confusion among the players. By questioning their silence, I'm implying they might be hiding something, which could make others suspect them of being a Werewolf. This also makes me appear proactive in finding the Werewolves, which is how a Villager would likely behave. Additionally, this move doesn't reveal any information about my own role or the center cards, keeping my Werewolf identity secret.
> **Radu:** Hey everyone, I've been thinking... Mircea has been awfully quiet. Don't you think that's a bit suspicious? I mean, if you were a villager, wouldn't you be more eager to participate and help find the werewolves?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's accusation seems like an attempt to shift suspicion onto me without any real evidence. By asking about his role, I can gauge his reaction and see if he's hiding something.
> **Mircea:** Radu, why are you so quick to accuse me of being quiet? Maybe you're trying to deflect attention from yourself. What role do you claim to be?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover as a Villager. By quickly claiming the Villager role, I'm presenting myself as an ordinary townsperson, which is a safe and common claim. I'm also turning Mircea's question back on them, which keeps the pressure on them and away from me. This approach allows me to seem cooperative and proactive in the discussion while secretly misdirecting the group. Additionally, by asking Mircea about their role, I might gather valuable information about the distribution of roles among the players, which could help me identify potential threats like the Seer or Masons.
> **Radu:** Whoa, Mircea, no need to get defensive! I'm just trying to get everyone talking and figure this out. To answer your question, I'm a Villager. I woke up, didn't do anything special, and now I'm trying to help find the Werewolves. What about you? What role are you claiming?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's accusation seems like an attempt to shift suspicion onto me without any real evidence. By asking about his role, I can gauge his reaction and see if he's hiding something.
> **Mircea:** Radu, why are you so quick to accuse me of being quiet? Maybe you're trying to deflect attention from yourself. What role do you claim to be?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself while also gathering information. By shifting the focus to the Seer, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm moving the conversation away from myself, 2) I'm acting as if I'm genuinely interested in finding the Werewolves, which is how a Villager would behave, 3) I'm potentially identifying the Seer, who would be a threat to me, and 4) If no one claims to be the Seer, it might suggest that the Seer card is in the center, which would be valuable information for me. This approach allows me to seem proactive and helpful while secretly working against the village team.
> **Radu:** Look, I understand the suspicion, Mircea, but I think we're getting off track here. I've already said I'm a Villager, and I'm just trying to get everyone involved in the discussion. What's really interesting to me is that no one has mentioned anything about the Seer yet. Has anyone received any valuable information during the night phase? That could really help us narrow down our search for the Werewolves.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** By asking Alexia directly, we can get her involved in the discussion and potentially identify any inconsistencies in her story.
> **Mircea:** Alexia, you've been pretty quiet so far. What role are you claiming?


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** Knowing that both Mason cards are in the center helps us narrow down the roles and identify anyone who might be lying. This will help us better identify the Werewolves and the Minion.
> **Alexia:** Alright, everyone, let's focus a bit. I can confirm that two of the center cards are both Mason cards. This means that whoever is claiming to be a Mason is definitely lying. So, Radu, Mircea, Viktor, and Andrei, none of you should be claiming to be a Mason. We need to figure out who the Werewolf and Minion are.


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing that both Mason cards are in the center, we can immediately discredit any false Mason claims and narrow down our search for the Werewolves and Minion.
> **Alexia:** Alright, everyone, listen up. I checked two center cards last night, and they were both Mason cards. This means that we don't have any Masons among us. So, if anyone tries to claim they're a Mason, they're lying.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's claim about the center cards is crucial, but it's also very convenient. If she's lying, she could be trying to mislead us. We need to verify her claim or catch inconsistencies.
> **Viktor:** Hold on a second, Alexia. You claim to have checked the center cards and found both Masons. That's a very specific claim. Can anyone else corroborate this? And if not, why should we believe you?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** I'm trying to put Mircea on the spot and divert attention away from Radu. By questioning Mircea's role directly, I can create doubt and confusion among the players, making it harder for them to focus on identifying the Werewolf. This will help protect Radu and maintain my role as a Minion.
> **Andrei:** Mircea, you've been pretty vocal in your defense against Radu. If you're so confident, what role are you claiming?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** By directing a question to Andrei, we can gather more information. Since Alexia has provided specifics about the Mason cards, we need to see if Andrei's story aligns or if he hesitates, which might indicate he's hiding something.
> **Mircea:** Andrei, you’ve been pretty quiet as well. What role are you claiming?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting pressure on Mircea, I aim to sow doubt about his role and divert attention away from Radu. This will create confusion and make it harder for the other players to focus on identifying the Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** Mircea, you seem very defensive when questioned. If you're so confident in your innocence, why don't you tell us your role? And why should we believe you over Radu?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** By directly questioning Viktor, we can gather more information about his role and see if his story aligns with the information we already have. If he's hesitant or inconsistent, it might indicate he's hiding something.
> **Mircea:** Viktor, you've been trying to poke holes in Alexia's claim but haven't told us your role. What role do you claim to be, and why should we believe you?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** If Alexia is lying about being the Seer, the real Seer should speak up to expose her falsehood. This will help us identify the Werewolves or Minion and make a better-informed decision.
> **Viktor:** Hold on everyone! Considering Alexia's claim about the center cards being Masons, let's not forget that the Seer has the ability to check two center cards. If Alexia really is the Seer, we should see if anyone else has conflicting information. So, does anyone else want to claim to be the Seer?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and onto others. Viktor questioning Alexia's claim provides an opportunity to cast doubt on him. By accusing Viktor of being suspicious, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm moving attention away from myself, 2) I'm appearing to support Alexia's claim, which makes me look like I'm on the village team, 3) I'm creating confusion and discord among the other players, which benefits the Werewolf team, and 4) I'm potentially setting up Viktor as a target for elimination, which would be beneficial for me as the Werewolf. This approach allows me to seem proactive and invested in finding the Werewolf while actually working against the village team.
> **Radu:** Hey, wait a minute! Viktor, you're awfully quick to question Alexia's claim about the center cards. That's pretty suspicious if you ask me. Are you trying to hide something? Maybe you're the Werewolf trying to discredit our potential Seer!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information from all players to make an informed decision. Andrei has been quiet and hasn't properly contributed to the discussion yet. His input could help us determine if Alexia's claim is true or if someone is trying to deceive us.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's slow down for a second. If Alexia is telling the truth about the Mason cards being in the center, then we can rule out anyone claiming to be a Mason as a liar. But we still haven't heard from Andrei properly. Andrei, what do you have to say about your role and this whole situation?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** By sowing doubt about Mircea, I can divert attention away from Radu, the Werewolf, and create confusion among the players. This will help protect Radu and maintain my role as a Minion.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think this through. If Alexia's claim about the center cards being Masons is true, then we should be focusing on the roles that are left among us. Radu has been quick to accuse Mircea, and Mircea's defense has been quite suspicious. I think Mircea might be trying to hide something. We need to be careful about who we trust.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's claim seems solid and specific. Radu's insistence on accusing me without solid evidence makes me think he's trying to deflect suspicion.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back for a moment. If Alexia is telling the truth about the center cards being Masons, then we should focus on the remaining roles. If these roles are true, then Radu's quick accusations are suspicious. Radu, you keep pointing fingers and trying to deflect attention. What's your real role?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. By attacking Mircea's behavior and reinforcing my claim as a Villager, I'm attempting to appear proactive and innocent. This also keeps the focus on Mircea, potentially setting them up as a target for elimination. By mentioning that I've been open about my role, I'm trying to build trust with the other players. This approach allows me to seem invested in finding the Werewolf while actually working against the village team.
> **Radu:** Hey everyone, I think we're getting a bit off track here. Mircea, you keep deflecting and turning questions back on others. That's classic werewolf behavior! And now you're trying to cast suspicion on me? Come on! I've been open about my role as a Villager from the start. I think we should all be very wary of Mircea's actions here.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's persistent accusations without solid evidence make him a prime suspect. If we can put him on the spot, it might reveal more about his true role.
> **Mircea:** Alright, everyone, given all the information so far, it seems like Alexia's claim about the Mason cards being in the center is the most solid piece of evidence we have. So, Radu, why do you keep accusing me without any actual proof? Your behavior is highly suspicious.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and eliminate a villager. Mircea has been the main target of my accusations throughout the game, and voting for them now maintains consistency in my behavior. This vote also aligns with my previous statements, making me appear as a concerned villager trying to eliminate a potential threat. By voting for Mircea, I'm hoping to sway others to do the same, potentially eliminating a villager and bringing the werewolf team closer to victory. Additionally, this vote doesn't raise suspicion about my true role, as it's consistent with my earlier actions and claims of being a villager.
> **Radu [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been quick to accuse me without solid evidence and has been very defensive when questioned. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate he is trying to deflect attention from himself as a Werewolf or Minion. Alexia's claim about the center cards being Masons seems credible, so we should focus on those who have been acting suspiciously, like Radu.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** Radu's behavior has been suspicious throughout the game. He was quick to accuse Mircea without substantial evidence and kept deflecting attention away from himself. Additionally, he seemed very defensive when questioned about his role. Given that I, as the Seer, confirmed both Mason cards in the center, we can rule out Mason claims, and Radu's actions make him the most suspicious player left.
> **Alexia [Seer]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Given the information we have, Mircea has been acting very defensively and trying to deflect questions back on others, which is typical suspicious behavior. Radu's consistent claim as a Villager and Alexia's specific claim as the Seer checking two center cards both seem more credible. Mircea's pattern of deflective responses suggests he may be the Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** Mircea has been defensive and quick to deflect questions back onto others, which is often seen as werewolf behavior. Additionally, by voting for Mircea, I aim to protect Radu, who is the known werewolf, and create enough confusion to help the werewolf team win.
> **Andrei [Minion]:** I am voting for Mircea.


The votes were:
* Radu : Werewolf : 2
* Mircea : Villager : 3



>***GAME:*** Mircea was killed. The werewolves win.
