## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Vladimir. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Semira is a minion and is aware that Vladimir is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Alexia. They are thinking about their action.


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can confirm whether any Werewolf or other important roles are not in play. This information will be crucial to guide the discussion during the Day phase and help the village team make informed decisions.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Mason

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** If someone claims to be the Seer, we can cross-check their information to see if it aligns with what others are saying. This could help us quickly find any inconsistencies and identify the Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Hey everyone, let's get this started. Does anyone want to claim being the Seer right away? It could help us identify the Werewolves faster.


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing this information, I can immediately narrow down the possible roles in play and potentially catch someone in a lie, which will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Alexia:** I think it's important to get things rolling. I can confirm that both Mason cards are in the center. So if anyone claims to be a Mason, they're lying.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast suspicion on others to divert attention from myself. Alexia's claim about the Mason cards is a perfect opportunity. By questioning her, I can appear as a concerned villager while potentially undermining a legitimate claim that could help the village team. This also allows me to indirectly discourage Mason claims, which could be beneficial for me as a Werewolf.
> **Vladimir:** Alexia, I find your claim about both Mason cards being in the center rather suspicious. How can you be so certain about that? It seems like you're trying to discourage anyone from claiming to be a Mason, which could be a clever tactic if you're actually a Werewolf.


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** Addressing Vladimir's suspicion directly will help shift focus back to the facts I provided. If no one can counter my claim about the Masons, it will strengthen my credibility and put pressure on any potential Werewolves to slip up.
> **Alexia:** Vladimir, why do you find my claim suspicious? If I were truly trying to deceive, I would have made a more vague statement. Instead, I gave specific information that can be verified by the fact that no one can claim to be a Mason.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question to Emil, I'm attempting to shift the focus away from myself and onto other players. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear engaged and concerned about finding the truth, potentially builds trust with Emil, and keeps the suspicion on Alexia. If Emil agrees with me, it could further isolate Alexia, making her a potential target for elimination. If Emil disagrees, it could create tension between players, which is beneficial for me as a Werewolf. Additionally, by suggesting Alexia might be the Minion rather than a Werewolf, I'm indirectly protecting my potential ally while still casting doubt on her claims.
> **Vladimir:** I appreciate your explanation, Alexia, but I'm still not entirely convinced. It's possible you could be the Minion trying to protect potential Werewolves by discouraging Mason claims. Emil, what's your take on this? Do you find Alexia's claim believable, or do you think there might be more to it?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's statement about both Mason cards being in the center is very specific and could be a tactic to dissuade true Masons from revealing themselves. By asking for additional confirmation about the center cards, we can either corroborate her story or expose her deception.
> **Emil:** Alright, let's break this down. If Alexia's claim about both Mason cards being in the center is true, then no one should come forward claiming to be a Mason, right? But what if Alexia is lying? It's possible that she's either a Werewolf or a Minion trying to create confusion. Can someone else confirm if they saw any other cards in the center?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information to verify or refute Alexia's claim about the Mason cards being in the center. Alexandra's initial question about the Seer seems to imply she might have relevant information. By asking her directly, we can gather additional clues to piece together the puzzle.
> **Emil:** Alright, let's assume Alexia is telling the truth for a moment. If both Mason cards are indeed in the center, this means anyone who claims to be a Mason is lying. But we haven't heard from Alexandra or Semira yet. Alexandra, you asked about the Seer earlier but haven't given us any information about what you saw or your role. Can you clarify your role or what you know?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to get input from all players, especially those who haven't spoken much yet. This could help us gather more information and see if there are any inconsistencies in the claims.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's think this through carefully. If Alexia is telling the truth about both Mason cards being in the center, then there shouldn't be any Mason claims. But what if Alexia is trying to mislead us? Vladimir seems to have a good point. Semira, you haven't said much yet. What do you think about Alexia's claim? Do you believe her, or do you think she might be trying to trick us?


***Semira (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting suspicion on Vladimir, I aim to deflect attention from him being a werewolf. This will also make me appear as a villager actively participating in the discussion, while subtly leading the other players away from suspecting him.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's calm down and think this through. I find it interesting how Vladimir quickly pounced on Alexia's claim about the Masons. While Alexia's claim could be true or false, Vladimir's eagerness to cast doubt makes me wonder about his intentions. What if Vladimir is trying to divert attention away from himself? So far, he seems the most suspicious to me. What do you all think?


***Semira (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing the attention to Alexandra, I can keep the discussion focused on Alexia's claim while subtly monitoring everyone's reactions. This helps me gather information without casting suspicion on Vladimir, the Werewolf. Additionally, it allows me to appear as an engaged villager seeking the truth.
> **Semira:** Alexia, I appreciate your confidence, but I'm not entirely convinced yet. You've made a bold claim about both Mason cards being in the center, but I think we need to hear more from everyone before we can draw any conclusions. Alexandra, what do you think about Alexia's claim? Do you have any information that could either support or contradict what she's saying?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's bold claim about the Mason cards being in the center could be a strategic move to mislead us. If she's the Minion or a Werewolf, this could be a way to throw us off. It's crucial to understand her motivations and see if her responses align with what we know so far.
> **Alexandra:** Semira, I get where you're coming from, but I think we need to be cautious. Vladimir did highlight a good point about Alexia potentially being the Minion or a Werewolf. Alexia, why did you decide to reveal both Mason cards being in the center so quickly? What do you hope to achieve by doing that?


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** We need more information to piece together the roles. Since Alexandra initiated the conversation about the Seer, she might have more knowledge that could validate my claim or provide new insights. If she avoids the question or provides contradictory information, it might indicate she has something to hide.
> **Alexia:** Alexandra, you asked about the Seer earlier but haven't given us any information about what you saw or your role. Can you clarify your role or what you know?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to understand Alexia's motivations for revealing this information so quickly. If she is genuinely trying to help, she should have a solid reason for doing so. This will help us determine if she's trustworthy or if she might be trying to mislead us.
> **Alexandra:** Alexia, I understand that you're trying to help by revealing that both Mason cards are in the center, but I'm not entirely convinced. Could you explain why you were so quick to reveal this information and what your role is?


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra's initial question about the Seer indicates she might have some pertinent information. We need her to clarify her role and intentions to see if it aligns with my claim about the Mason cards and to understand if she's part of the Villager team or trying to deceive us.
> **Alexia:** It's clear we're all being cautious, but let's piece this together. If both Mason cards are truly in the center, as I've seen, no one can claim to be a Mason. This simplifies things. Alexandra, you initiated by asking about the Seer but haven't given any info. So, Alexandra, what's your role, and why did you ask about the Seer specifically?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to understand Alexia's motivations and verify if her claim is credible. If she's lying, it could mean she's trying to protect the Werewolves or is herself a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, I think it's time to get some clarity here. Alexia, you've made a strong claim about both Mason cards being in the center, but I have to agree with Vladimir and Semira that it's still a bit suspicious. Can you tell us exactly what role you are and how you came to know this information?


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** We need more information from Alexandra since she initiated the conversation about the Seer. Understanding her reasoning and role will help us validate or disprove the Mason claim I made and guide us closer to identifying the Werewolves.
> **Alexia:** Alright, everyone, let's piece this together logically. If I'm telling the truth about both Mason cards being in the center, it means anyone claiming to be a Mason is lying. So far, no one has claimed to be a Mason, which supports my statement. Alexandra, your initial question about the Seer suggests you might have some crucial information. Why did you ask about the Seer specifically? What are you trying to find out?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir was quick to express doubts about Alexia's claim, and his motivation could be worth examining to see if it aligns with someone who is trying to mislead the group.
> **Alexandra:** Semira, let's consider the possibility that Vladimir is trying to deflect suspicion away from himself by questioning Alexia so quickly. Do you think Vladimir's behavior is consistent with someone trying to hide something?


***Semira (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing attention towards Alexandra, I can keep the focus away from Vladimir, the Werewolf. If Alexandra provides any information or hesitates, it could cast suspicion on her and distract the other players.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, I think it's time to get some clarity. Alexandra, you've been very quiet, and while you did ask about the Seer, you haven't provided any information yourself. In this game, silence can be just as telling as a bold claim. I'm starting to wonder if you're hiding something. Can you tell us what role you have and any information you might have gathered?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's immediate doubt about Alexia's claim could be an attempt to divert attention away from himself. By pushing him for more details, we might uncover his true intentions and gain a better understanding of his role.
> **Alexandra:** Semira, I understand your suspicion, but I want to address Vladimir directly. Vladimir, your quick skepticism towards Alexia's claim makes me wonder about your intentions. Why were you so eager to discredit her? Could you explain your reasoning in more detail?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. Alexandra's initial question about the Seer and subsequent silence make her an easy target. By accusing her, I can appear proactive in finding the Werewolves while actually misdirecting the group. This also puts pressure on Alexandra to reveal information, which could potentially expose the real Seer or other important roles, giving me more information to work with. Additionally, this move shifts the focus away from Alexia and the Mason debate, which was starting to put me in a risky position.
> **Vladimir:** I think we're getting sidetracked here. Alexandra, you initially asked about the Seer, but you've been awfully quiet since then. Are you trying to hide something? Maybe you're a Werewolf trying to throw us off by asking about the Seer?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's persistent and detailed claim about both Mason cards being in the center seems overly confident and could be a tactic to mislead us. Given that no one else has claimed to be a Mason, her quick revelation might be a strategy to throw us off if she is a Werewolf or Minion. Additionally, her insistence on questioning my motives without providing clear evidence of her own role makes her the most suspicious to me.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir's quick skepticism towards my claim about the Masons being in the center seemed like an attempt to deflect attention and cast doubt. Given that no one has claimed to be a Mason, it adds credibility to my statement. Vladimir's behavior throughout the discussion has been suspicious, and voting for him seems like the best strategy to identify a potential Werewolf.
> **Alexia [Seer]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and eliminate potential threats. Alexandra's initial question about the Seer and subsequent silence make her an easy target. By voting for her, I can appear proactive in finding the Werewolves while actually misdirecting the group. This also puts pressure on Alexandra, potentially exposing the real Seer or other important roles if she defends herself. Additionally, this move shifts focus away from the earlier debate about Alexia and the Mason cards, which was starting to put me in a risky position. Eliminating Alexandra could remove a potential Seer or another villager role, benefiting the Werewolf team.
> **Vladimir [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's quick skepticism towards Alexia's detailed claim and his continued attempts to cast doubt make him the most suspicious to me. His behavior aligns with that of someone who might be trying to divert attention, potentially a Werewolf or a Minion.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Semira (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to create doubt around Alexia's bold claim about both Mason cards being in the center. By casting my vote for her, I can create confusion and potentially lead the villagers to vote incorrectly, aiding the werewolf team.
> **Semira [Minion]:** I am voting for Alexia.


The votes were:
* Alexandra : Villager : 1
* Alexia : Seer : 2
* Vladimir : Werewolf : 2



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Alexia, Vladimir. The villagers win.
