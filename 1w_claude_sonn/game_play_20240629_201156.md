## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Ileana. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Kraven. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Andrei. They are thinking about their action.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** It's generally more useful to know the role of a specific player in order to make targeted arguments during the Day phase. Lucian has been known to be quite persuasive, so knowing his role early on will help in either aligning with him or casting doubt on his statements if he turns out to be a Werewolf or Minion.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By targeting Semira and pointing out her quietness, I'm attempting to cast doubt on her while appearing proactive and helpful to the village team. This also gives me an opportunity to gauge her reaction and potentially identify her role. If she's the Seer or a Mason, it would be beneficial for me to know. Additionally, by asking her about her role, I'm setting a precedent for open discussion, which I can use later to either blend in or identify potential threats to the Werewolf team.
> **Ileana:** Hey everyone, I'm feeling a bit uneasy about Semira. Has anyone else noticed how quiet she's been? It's almost like she's trying to avoid drawing attention to herself. What do you think, Semira? Care to share what role you might have?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's accusation seems like it could be an attempt to deflect suspicion from herself. It's important to challenge her and see how she responds.
> **Semira:** Ileana, I'm just a regular Villager. You're coming off a bit too aggressive for my liking. Why are you so quick to point fingers?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By deflecting Semira's accusation and claiming to be a Villager myself, I'm attempting to blend in with the village team. Targeting Lucian now serves multiple purposes: it takes the focus off me, potentially reveals information about another player, and makes me appear proactive in the village's interest. If Lucian is the Seer or a Mason, his response might give that away, which would be valuable information for me as the Werewolf. Additionally, by engaging multiple players, I'm creating a more complex social dynamic that could make it harder for others to pinpoint me as the Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** Whoa, Semira, no need to get defensive! I was just trying to get everyone talking. But now that you mention it, your reaction does seem a bit odd. As for me, I'm also a Villager, and I'm just trying to figure out who we can trust here. Lucian, you've been pretty quiet too. What's your take on all this?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** We've heard from Ileana and Semira, but Andrei hasn't said much. It's important to gather information from everyone to start piecing together who might be the Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** Andrei, you've been awfully quiet over there. What role do you claim to have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** We haven't heard from Kraven yet, and it's important to get everyone talking. Ileana's initial accusation might be a deflection tactic, and Semira's reaction could be genuine or a tactic. By questioning Kraven, we can gather more information to piece together the bigger picture.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, I've been paying attention to what's been said so far. Ileana started by accusing Semira, which could be an attempt to deflect attention from herself. Semira claimed Villager, which is a safe and common claim. I think we need to focus on those who haven't been under scrutiny yet. Kraven, what role do you claim to have?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to probe Andrei's role claim to see if he's trying to fly under the radar. Ileana's aggressive behavior is also suspicious. By targeting Andrei, I'm applying pressure and seeing how he reacts, which might reveal more about his true role.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, listen up! I've been closely watching the dynamics here. Ileana, you're coming off as a bit too aggressive, almost like you're trying to direct attention away from yourself. Andrei, I'm not buying your neutral stance either. You're deflecting attention. Let's cut to the chase. One of you might be hiding something. Andrei, what role do you claim to have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven has been very accusatory without providing concrete information. By putting him on the spot, we can gather more details about his intentions and role, which will help us identify inconsistencies or potential threats.
> **Andrei:** Kraven, you've been pretty vocal about not trusting me and Ileana. I think it's time you give us more than just accusations. What role do you claim to have?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to probe Andrei's role claim to see if he's trying to fly under the radar. Ileana's aggressive behavior is also suspicious. By targeting Andrei, I'm applying pressure and seeing how he reacts, which might reveal more about his true role.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, listen up! I've been closely watching the dynamics here. Ileana, you're coming off as a bit too aggressive, almost like you're trying to direct attention away from yourself. Andrei, I'm not buying your neutral stance either. You're deflecting attention. Let's cut to the chase. One of you might be hiding something. Andrei, what role do you claim to have?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's aggressive approach and repeated accusations could be a strategy to mislead us. Pressuring him to reveal his role might expose inconsistencies or clarify his intentions.
> **Semira:** Kraven, you've been rather vocal about not trusting Andrei and Ileana. It almost seems like you're trying to stir up trouble without actually providing much information. What's your role?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's neutral stance and deflection tactics are making me wary. By pressing him for a role claim, we can gather more information and see if his story holds up or if he stumbles, indicating he might be hiding something.
> **Kraven:** Alright, everyone, I think Andrei's been trying to play it safe and stay out of the spotlight. That makes me suspicious. Andrei, why don't you tell us what role you claim to have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's silence could be a tactic to avoid suspicion. Given that I know he's a Villager, his input can help us focus on finding the real threats. Additionally, it forces him to participate, potentially revealing more information about other players.
> **Andrei:** Lucian, you've been pretty quiet and haven't shared much. Given that Semira, Ileana, and Kraven have all put forward their claims, I'd like to hear more from you. What role do you claim to have?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's repetitive deflection and lack of transparency could indicate he's trying to hide something, possibly being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian:** I find it interesting that Kraven keeps redirecting questions without giving us much about his own role. Why so evasive, Kraven?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's deflective responses and neutral stance are suspicious. By pressing him for a role claim, we can gather more information and see if his story holds up or if he stumbles, indicating he might be hiding something.
> **Kraven:** Alright, everyone, it's time to cut through the noise. Andrei's been dodging direct answers and trying to stay under the radar. That behavior is classic Werewolf tactics. Andrei, I'm calling you out—what's your role?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven's behavior has been erratic and overly aggressive without giving us any useful information. This is a classic tactic to sow confusion and deflect suspicion. By focusing on him, we can either confirm or rule out a strong possibility of him being a Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, it's time to get to the bottom of this. From what I've observed, Kraven has been extremely accusatory without providing any concrete information about his own role. This behavior is very suspicious, almost like he's trying to deflect attention from himself. I'm calling Kraven out as a potential Werewolf. What do you all think?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's behavior seems suspicious. Repeating the same accusations without providing any concrete information makes me think he's hiding something. He could be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian:** I've noticed that Kraven has been quite repetitive and hasn't shared much about his own role. This could be a tactic to deflect attention from himself. Why are you being so evasive, Kraven?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's responses have been deflective and non-committal. This is a typical strategy for Werewolves attempting to avoid suspicion. By pressing Andrei for a role claim, we can gather more information and see if his story holds up or if he stumbles, indicating he might be hiding something.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. Andrei has been dodging direct answers and trying to stay under the radar. That behavior is classic Werewolf tactics. Andrei, I'm calling you out—what's your role?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven has been overly aggressive and evasive, which are classic tactics for a Werewolf trying to sow confusion. By focusing on him, we can either confirm or rule out a strong possibility of him being a threat.
> **Andrei:** Kraven, it's really suspicious how you've been dodging direct questions and constantly accusing others without giving us any concrete information. Everyone, I think we need to seriously consider that Kraven might be a Werewolf. What do you all think?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana's aggressive behavior and quick accusations could be a tactic to deflect attention away from herself. By pressing her for a role claim, we can gather more information and see if her story holds up or if she stumbles, indicating she might be hiding something.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, listen up! There's been a lot of back-and-forth, and I think it's time we cut to the chase. Ileana has been very aggressive from the start, and it's making me suspicious. Ileana, what's your role?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. Kraven has been particularly aggressive, which makes him a good target. By turning the tables on him and questioning his evasiveness, I'm attempting to cast doubt on him while simultaneously defending myself. This also serves to create confusion among the villagers, which is beneficial for me. Additionally, by directly asking about his role, I'm putting him on the spot, which might reveal valuable information or at least buy me some time.
> **Ileana:** Whoa, hold on a second, Kraven! You've been throwing accusations left and right without giving us any real information about yourself. That's classic deflection tactics if you ask me. I think we all need to take a step back and look at who's been the most evasive here. Kraven, you've been pushing hard against Andrei and me, but what about you? What role are you claiming to have? Because from where I'm sitting, your behavior is screaming 'Werewolf' to me.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's neutral stance and evasive responses are very suspicious. By pressing him for a role claim, we can gather more information and potentially expose him if he's lying. This is crucial for narrowing down the possible Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's get serious. The way I see it, Andrei has been dodging direct answers and trying to stay neutral. That's a classic deflection tactic. If you're truly on the village team, you should have no problem telling us your role, Andrei. So, what's it going to be?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate potential threats. Kraven has been the most aggressive and accusatory, making him a prime target. By voting for him, I'm attempting to remove a player who seems perceptive and could potentially expose me. Additionally, his behavior has made others suspicious of him, so my vote aligns with the general sentiment, helping me blend in with the village team. This move also helps create more chaos and confusion among the remaining players, which is beneficial for me as the Werewolf.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been extremely aggressive and repetitive, avoiding providing any concrete information about his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with Werewolf tactics. By voting for Kraven, we can address the most suspicious player and potentially eliminate a threat to the village.
> **Semira [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been extremely repetitive in his accusations and has not provided any concrete information about his own role. This behavior is very suspicious and seems like a deflection tactic, which is often used by Werewolves or Minions. I believe voting for Kraven gives us the best chance of uncovering a Werewolf.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven has been highly accusatory and evasive throughout the discussion, which is consistent with Werewolf behavior trying to deflect suspicion. Additionally, I know Lucian is a Villager, and Kraven's repeated focus on me without providing concrete information makes him the most suspicious candidate. Voting for Kraven gives us the best chance of eliminating a potential threat.
> **Andrei [Seer]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei has been dodging direct answers and maintaining a neutral stance, which are classic deflection tactics. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with typical Werewolf strategies. By voting for Andrei, we can test if he is indeed hiding something, and potentially eliminate a Werewolf.
> **Kraven [Mason]:** I am voting for Andrei.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Seer : 1
* Kraven : Mason : 4



>***GAME:*** Kraven was killed. The werewolves win.
