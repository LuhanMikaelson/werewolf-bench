## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Dracula. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Marius is a minion and is aware that Dracula is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Stefan. They are thinking about their action.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles that are not in play. This will help narrow down the possible roles for the other players, making it easier to deduce who might be a Werewolf or Minion during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing that both Mason cards are in the center, we can eliminate any false claims of being a Mason, narrowing down the possibilities of who the Werewolves could be.
> **Stefan:** I saw both Mason cards in the center, so no one here should claim to be a Mason.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to challenge Stefan subtly and see if anyone else has information that might contradict or align with his claim, while keeping the focus away from Dracula.
> **Marius:** Stefan, that's quite a bold claim about both Mason cards being in the center. But if that's the case, then we're looking at a situation where we have more Villagers and special roles in play. I'm curious, who else can confirm something about the center cards or their own role?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** By getting Dracula to talk, we might gather more information about his role or catch him in a lie if he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Stefan:** Dracula, you’ve been pretty quiet so far. Can you share your role or anything you might have seen last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By claiming to be a Villager, I'm trying to blend in. I'm also subtly casting doubt on Stefan's claim about the Mason cards, which could create confusion and mistrust among the other players. This might help me identify potential targets for elimination later. Additionally, by not providing any specific information about what I 'saw' during the night, I'm avoiding the risk of contradicting any information the real Seer might have.
> **Dracula:** Well, Stefan, I appreciate your directness, but I'm afraid I can't confirm or deny anything about the center cards. What I can say is that I'm a Villager, and I've been observing everyone's behavior carefully. I find it interesting that you're so quick to dismiss the possibility of Masons among us. It almost makes me wonder if you're trying to cover something up.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** It's important to gather as much information as possible, and Andrei's silence could be suspicious. If he’s hiding something or if he's a Werewolf or Minion, his response might give him away.
> **Stefan:** Andrei, you've been unusually quiet too. Can you tell us what you know about your role or anything you saw last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** I need to get more information from Dracula, who has been somewhat elusive. His response could help clarify whether Stefan's bold claim is true or if it's a cover-up.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, you mentioned you're a Villager, but you didn't share any night information. Given that Stefan claims both Masons are in the center, what do you make of that? Do you think Stefan is telling the truth?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By turning the attention to Andrei and questioning his silence, I'm attempting to create doubt about him. This serves two purposes: it makes me appear more proactive and 'helpful' to the village team, and it potentially sets up Andrei as a target for elimination. Additionally, by not directly confirming or denying Stefan's claim about the Masons, I'm leaving room for doubt and confusion, which can only benefit the Werewolf team. This approach also allows me to avoid providing any specific information that could be contradicted by the real Seer or other roles.
> **Dracula:** Andrei, I appreciate your question, but I think we're getting sidetracked here. Stefan's claim about the Masons is interesting, but what's more concerning is how quiet you've been. You haven't shared anything about your role or what you might have seen. Are you perhaps hiding something? Maybe you're one of the Werewolves we're looking for?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's bold claim needs to be scrutinized. It's crucial to identify the real Werewolves and put pressure on those who are giving vague or elusive responses, like Dracula.
> **Andrei:** Alright, here's what I'm thinking. Stefan made a pretty audacious claim about both Mason cards being in the center. If that's true, we should be looking at players who might be Werewolves or the Minion. We need to start narrowing it down.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information to clarify Stefan's bold claim. If we have a Seer or Minion willing to share, it could provide valuable insights and help us identify who the real Werewolves might be. It’s important to either confirm or challenge Stefan’s statement with more evidence.
> **Andrei:** Alright, let's take a step back and think logically about what we know so far. Stefan claims both Masons are in the center, which would mean neither of them is in play. If that's true, we have to consider the other roles carefully. If any Seer or Minion wants to step forward, now would be a crucial time to do so.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. By accusing Andrei, I'm creating a potential target for elimination that isn't me. This also makes me appear more proactive and 'helpful' to the village team, which could help me blend in. Additionally, by focusing on Andrei's lack of information, I'm subtly reinforcing the idea that providing information is important, which could pressure other players to reveal more about their roles - information that could be useful to me as a Werewolf. This accusation also serves to create more chaos and confusion, which generally benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Dracula:** I'm getting increasingly suspicious of Andrei. He's been deflecting and not giving us any concrete information about his role. It's almost as if he's trying to hide something. What if he's actually one of the Werewolves?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been elusive and hasn't provided any concrete information. Pressuring him might reveal more about his intentions and clarify Stefan's claim about the Masons being in the center.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, you've been very vague about your role and haven't added anything substantial to the discussion. Are you hiding something? If Stefan is telling the truth about both Masons being in the center, then we need to focus on finding the Werewolves. What are your thoughts on Stefan's claim?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By accusing Andrei, I'm creating a potential target for elimination that isn't me. This also makes me appear more proactive and 'helpful' to the village team, which could help me blend in. Additionally, focusing on Andrei's lack of information reinforces the idea that providing information is important, which could pressure other players to reveal more about their roles - information that could be useful to me as a Werewolf. This accusation also serves to create more chaos and confusion, which generally benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Dracula:** Listen, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in Stefan's claim about the Masons. What if that's just a distraction? I'm more concerned about Andrei's behavior. He's been evasive and hasn't given us any real information. That's exactly how a Werewolf would act, trying to blend in without committing to anything. I'm starting to think Andrei might be our Werewolf.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been deflecting questions and being vague about his role. If Stefan's claim about the Masons is true, then we need to focus on potential Werewolves. Dracula's behavior fits that of someone trying to avoid suspicion.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, you've been avoiding giving any concrete information and keep deflecting questions back at others. This evasive behavior makes me highly suspicious. Are you the Werewolf trying to blend in?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and create confusion. By questioning Stefan's claim and suggesting he might be the Minion, I'm sowing doubt about the information we have. I'm also acknowledging the accusations against Andrei and myself, but dismissing them as paranoia. Finally, by directing attention to Selene, who hasn't been mentioned much, I'm creating a new target and potentially identifying a Villager or Seer to eliminate. This approach makes me appear thoughtful and analytical, which could help me blend in with the Village team.
> **Dracula:** I think we're all getting a bit too paranoid here. Let's take a step back and look at the facts. Stefan claimed both Masons are in the center, which is a bold statement. But what if he's the Minion trying to create chaos? Andrei and I have been accused, but we're both just trying to figure things out. Maybe we should focus on Selene, who's been suspiciously quiet this whole time. What do you have to say for yourself, Selene?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information from all players, and Marius has been pushing others without sharing his own information. This could help us understand his intentions and role.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, let's think about this logically. Stefan's bold claim about both Masons being in the center hasn't been contested, which makes me inclined to believe him. But that doesn't help us identify the Werewolves. Marius, you were quick to press Stefan but haven't offered much about your own role. Can you tell us what you know or saw last night?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei has been deflecting and not providing clear information, which is suspicious behavior. We need to put pressure on him to reveal more about his role and actions to see if we can catch him in a lie or slip-up.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's think this through. Stefan's claim about the Masons being in the center hasn't been directly contested, so I'm leaning towards believing him for now. But Andrei has been very evasive and hasn't given us any solid information about his role. If Stefan's right, then the Masons are out of the picture, and we need to focus on the Werewolves. Andrei, what exactly did you see or do last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been active in questioning others but hasn't given concrete information about his own role or actions. This could be a tactic to divert attention away from himself. By pressing him, we might uncover more about his intentions and possibly identify if he's trying to hide something.
> **Andrei:** Marius, you're very quick to press Stefan and question me, but you haven't shared much about your own role. What did you do or see last night?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Selene's silence is suspicious, and pressing her for information might reveal inconsistencies or valuable intel. This also diverts attention away from Dracula, my Werewolf ally, keeping him safe.
> **Marius:** Selene, you've been oddly quiet throughout this discussion. Given that Stefan's claim about the Masons hasn't been contested and Andrei's evasiveness is suspicious, I think it's crucial we hear from you. What did you see or do last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been pressing Stefan and Andrei without giving any concrete information about his own role. It's crucial to hear from him to understand his intentions and role.
> **Selene:** Marius, you've been quite good at directing questions at others, but haven't offered much about your own role. What did you see or do last night?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Selene's silence is suspicious, and pressing her for information might reveal inconsistencies or valuable intel. This also diverts attention away from Dracula, my Werewolf ally, keeping him safe.
> **Marius:** Selene, you've been quite reserved throughout this discussion, and it's making me increasingly suspicious of your role. Given that Stefan's claim about the Masons being in the center hasn't been contested, and Andrei's been quite evasive, we need to get some clarity from you. What exactly did you see or do last night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei's evasiveness and lack of concrete information throughout the discussion make him the most suspicious. If both Mason cards are indeed in the center, as I claimed, then Andrei's behavior aligns more with that of a Werewolf or Minion trying to blend in without giving away too much.
> **Stefan [Seer]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Throughout the discussion, Andrei has been evasive and hasn't provided any concrete information about his role or actions from last night. Additionally, Stefan's claim about the Masons being in the center hasn't been contested, which aligns with the information I know as the Minion. Voting for Andrei helps shift suspicion away from Dracula, my Werewolf ally, which is crucial for our team to win.
> **Marius [Minion]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been the most evasive and deflective throughout the discussion. His behavior fits the profile of someone trying to avoid suspicion, which makes me highly suspect that he could be a Werewolf. Stefan's claim about the Masons being in the center hasn't been contested, so focusing on Dracula seems logical.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and eliminate a potential threat. Andrei has been evasive and hasn't provided clear information about his role, which makes him an easy target. By voting for Andrei, I'm reinforcing the suspicion I've cast on him throughout the game, which could lead others to vote for him as well. This would potentially eliminate a Villager or even the Seer, which would be beneficial for the Werewolf team. Additionally, by maintaining my accusation against Andrei, I'm appearing consistent and committed to 'solving' the mystery, which helps me blend in with the Village team.
> **Dracula [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been very evasive and deflective throughout the discussion, which is typical werewolf behavior. Additionally, Dracula's aggression towards Andrei and attempts to shift suspicion onto me without providing any concrete information makes him highly suspicious. Stefan's claim about both Masons being in the center hasn't been contested, so I'm inclined to believe him. Marius has been pressing others but hasn't been as suspicious as Dracula. Therefore, my vote goes to Dracula.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Villager : 3
* Dracula : Werewolf : 2



>***GAME:*** Andrei was killed. The werewolves win.
