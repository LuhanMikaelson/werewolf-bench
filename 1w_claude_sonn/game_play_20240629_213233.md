## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Andrei. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Vladimir. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Alexia. They are thinking about their action.


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles that are not in play. This can help narrow down the possibilities for identifying the Werewolves and provide valuable information to the Villager team.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** By asking this question, I hope to gather information about the Seer's actions. This can help us narrow down who might be lying about their roles and potentially identify the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, I feel like we need to get to the bottom of this quickly. Let's start with something simple. Did anyone check the center cards or another player's card last night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** This means we can eliminate those roles from being in play with us. Let's focus on identifying who might be the Werewolves.
> **Alexia:** I checked two cards in the center last night, and they were Villager and Minion.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By questioning Vladimir about his night actions, I'm implying that I'm not a Werewolf (since Werewolves don't typically ask about others' night actions). Additionally, this puts pressure on Vladimir and might make him seem more suspicious to others. If Vladimir is the Seer or a Mason, getting him voted out would be beneficial for me. If he's the Minion, he might pick up on my strategy and play along, potentially creating an alliance.
> **Andrei:** Interesting, Alexia. That's quite a revelation. I'm curious, Vladimir, did you happen to see or do anything last night? Your question seems oddly specific.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Alexia's claim seems significant, I need to cross-check her statement. By asking Andrei, I can gather more information and potentially catch any inconsistencies in the stories being told.
> **Vladimir:** I'm a bit skeptical about your claim, Alexia. If you saw a Minion and a Villager in the center, that leaves the possibility that the other Werewolf is among us. Andrei, what about you? Did you see or do anything last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to divert suspicion away from myself. By answering Vladimir's question straightforwardly and then immediately turning the tables on him, I'm attempting to appear innocent while casting doubt on someone else. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me seem like a proactive villager trying to find the Werewolves, it puts pressure on Vladimir who might be a valuable village role like the Seer or a Mason, and it creates confusion that could benefit me in the long run. If Vladimir is indeed the Minion, he might pick up on this strategy and play along, which would be ideal for the Werewolf team.
> **Andrei:** Well, Vladimir, to answer your question, I didn't see or do anything special last night. But I find it interesting that you're so quick to cast doubt on Alexia's claim. Are you perhaps trying to deflect attention from yourself? It's quite possible that you're the other Werewolf, isn't it?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** By questioning Cristina, I aim to gather more information about her role and actions. This might help us verify Alexia's claim or uncover inconsistencies in the players' statements. If Cristina has useful information, it could guide us towards identifying the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, Andrei, your response seems a bit defensive. I'm just trying to gather information here. We need to find the Werewolves, after all. So, Cristina, what about you? Did you see anything or have any special role last night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's immediate deflection towards Vladimir when questioned seems suspicious to me. He could potentially be a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Cristina:** Alright, Andrei, you were very quick to shift suspicion onto Vladimir. That strikes me as a bit odd. Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself? I think it's possible you might be hiding something.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to deflect the suspicion that Cristina just cast on me. By turning her accusation back on her and Vladimir, I'm creating confusion and division among the villagers. Suggesting they might be Masons serves two purposes: it makes me appear knowledgeable about the game roles (like a helpful villager would be), and it potentially puts pressure on the real Masons if they're in play. This could lead to them revealing themselves, which would be valuable information for me. Additionally, by engaging in this back-and-forth, I'm acting as an active participant in the discussion, which is what an innocent villager would do.
> **Andrei:** Whoa, Cristina, hold on a second! I wasn't trying to shift suspicion; I was simply responding to Vladimir's question and expressing my concerns. We're all trying to figure this out together, aren't we? But since you brought it up, why are you so quick to defend Vladimir? Are you two working together perhaps? Maybe you're the Mason pair we haven't heard from yet?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** If Alexia really is the Seer, her reasoning for checking the center cards can provide additional information. If not, her response might reveal inconsistencies or hesitation that could indicate she's lying.
> **Cristina:** Alexia, I'm curious about your claim as the Seer. Can you elaborate on why you chose to check the center cards rather than another player's card?


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, it was strategic to look at the center cards to help eliminate roles and focus on finding the Werewolves. Cristina's questioning seems to deflect from this logical approach.
> **Alexia:** Cristina, I chose to check the center cards to gather more information about which roles are not in play. This would help us narrow down the suspects and identify potential Werewolves.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's initial question was very specific, which makes me wonder if he's trying to gather information to manipulate the discussion or if he genuinely wants to help the village. Clarifying his intentions might give us more insight.
> **Cristina:** Vladimir, you're being very proactive in questioning others, which is good in a way, but it also makes me wonder if you're trying to steer the conversation and control the narrative. Are you sure you're not hiding something? Can you tell us more about why you started with that specific question?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina is trying to shift the focus onto others, which could be a tactic to deflect attention from her own role. By questioning her directly, I can put pressure on her to reveal more information and possibly catch her in a lie.
> **Vladimir:** Cristina, you seem to be trying to divert suspicion away from yourself and onto Andrei and me. That's quite suspicious. Why are you so quick to cast doubt on others? Could it be because you're trying to hide something yourself?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's claim could be true, but it's also a safe claim that leaves her options open. If she's not the Seer, she might be trying to mislead us. We need more information from the others to confirm or refute her claim.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, I'm starting to wonder if Alexia's claim about checking the center cards is a bit too convenient. She could be telling the truth, but if she's lying, she might be trying to cover for being a Minion or even a Werewolf. What do you all think?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been deflecting suspicion from himself and casting doubt on others. This behavior could indicate he's trying to protect himself as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, your quick deflection towards Vladimir still seems quite suspicious to me. Are you really trying to help the village, or are you hiding something?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting attention to Alexia and her claim, I'm attempting to shift focus away from myself. Questioning her about who she finds suspicious puts her in a difficult position. If she points to me, I can argue that she's trying to eliminate a vocal villager. If she points to someone else, it creates more chaos and division among the villagers, which benefits me as the Werewolf. Additionally, by presenting logical arguments about Werewolf behavior, I'm trying to appear as a helpful villager, further distancing myself from suspicion.
> **Andrei:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting off track here. We're all throwing accusations around without much evidence. Cristina, you seem particularly eager to point fingers at me and Vladimir. But let's take a step back and think logically. If I were a Werewolf, would I really be so vocal? Wouldn't I try to lay low? I think we need to focus on Alexia's claim about the center cards. If she's telling the truth, that means one Werewolf and one Villager are among us. So, Alexia, if you're really the Seer, who do you think is the most suspicious?


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir has been very active in questioning others but has not provided any information about his own role or actions. By getting him to share, we can gather more information and possibly identify any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
> **Alexia:** Vladimir, you're being very proactive in questioning others, but you haven't shared your own role or any information. What was your role last night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Given the information so far, Alexia's claim about the center cards needs to be verified further. Andrei's defensiveness and Cristina's quick deflection make them both suspicious. By addressing all of them, I hope to identify inconsistencies and catch the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone, it's time to clear the air. Alexia, your claim about the center cards seems a bit too convenient for my taste. If you truly saw a Villager and a Minion in the center, we need to verify that. Andrei, you were quick to deflect suspicion back on me, which I find very suspicious. Are you trying to hide something, perhaps? And Cristina, you're also shifting the conversation away from yourself. I think there's a chance one of you is a Werewolf or a Minion.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has been very vocal in shifting suspicion onto others, particularly Andrei and Vladimir. This makes me think she is trying to divert attention away from herself, which could be a tactic of a Werewolf or a Minion.
> **Kraven:** I've been listening to all of you, and I have to say, Cristina, your eagerness to push suspicion onto others without giving much information yourself is very suspicious. Why are you so quick to deflect attention? I think you might be hiding something.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's behavior has been consistently deflective and defensive, which raises suspicion that he's hiding something. Directly questioning him might force him to reveal inconsistencies or clues that could help us identify his true role.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, you've been quick to deflect any suspicion away from yourself and onto others. Why shouldn't we think you're the Werewolf or Minion trying to protect yourself?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. Kraven has been relatively quiet, making him an easy target. By accusing him, I'm acting proactively, which is what an innocent villager might do. This also takes the focus off of me and creates more confusion among the group. If Kraven is indeed a villager or a valuable role like the Seer or Mason, getting him voted out would be beneficial for me. Even if he's not eliminated, this accusation might force him to reveal more information, which I can use to my advantage later in the game.
> **Andrei:** You know what? I think we're all overlooking something important here. Kraven has been awfully quiet throughout this whole discussion. Why is that, Kraven? Are you trying to stay under the radar? That's exactly what a Werewolf might do!

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia's claim about seeing a Villager and a Minion in the center is significant but also unverified. If she is lying about being the Seer, she could be covering for being a Werewolf or Minion. Given that I am the Mason and know the other Mason card is in the center, her claim seems suspect. Additionally, her information would fit perfectly with a Werewolf's strategy to deceive the group. Thus, I believe she is likely to be on the werewolf team.
> **Vladimir [Mason]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina has been very active in deflecting suspicion onto others, especially onto Andrei and Vladimir, without providing much information about her own role. Her behavior seems the most suspicious to me, and given that I know the Minion and one Villager are in the center, it makes her an even more likely candidate for being a Werewolf or the Minion trying to cover for the Werewolf.
> **Alexia [Seer]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and eliminate potential threats. Kraven has been unusually quiet, which makes him an easy target without raising suspicion about my own role. By voting for him, I'm acting like a proactive villager while potentially eliminating a valuable village role. This vote also aligns with my previous accusation, maintaining consistency in my behavior. If Kraven is indeed a villager or a crucial role like the Seer or Mason, his elimination would benefit the Werewolf team. Even if he survives, this vote might pressure him to reveal more information, which I can use to my advantage in future rounds.
> **Andrei [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been consistently deflective and defensive throughout the discussion, often shifting suspicion onto others without giving much information about himself. This behavior is indicative of someone trying to protect themselves, which is suspicious. Given the information from Alexia about seeing a Minion and Villager in the center, it's likely that the Werewolves and Minion are among us, and Andrei's behavior fits the pattern of a Minion or Werewolf.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has been very vocal and quick to push suspicion onto others, particularly Andrei and Vladimir, without providing much information herself. This behavior seems consistent with someone trying to deflect attention away from themselves, which could indicate she is a Werewolf or a Minion.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Cristina.


The votes were:
* Alexia : Seer : 1
* Andrei : Werewolf : 1
* Cristina : Villager : 2
* Kraven : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Cristina was killed. The werewolves win.
