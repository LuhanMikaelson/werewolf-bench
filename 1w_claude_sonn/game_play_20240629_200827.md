## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Starting off by asking for role claims can help us identify who might be lying or telling the truth, and can give us valuable information to start deducing who the Werewolves might be.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's get things moving. Who wants to claim their role first?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira was the first to speak up and ask for roles, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion. I want to see how she responds to being questioned.
> **Dragos:** Alright, I'll start. I'm just a Villager, nothing special here. But I'll say this, Semira, you were quick to ask for roles. Are you hiding something?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos was quick to claim Villager and deflect suspicion onto me. It’s important to probe his motivations to see if he slips up or reveals more information.
> **Semira:** Dragos, that's an interesting point, but I'm just trying to get the conversation started. What made you so quick to claim Villager? And what do you think the other roles might be?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** I find it suspicious that Semira was so eager to kick off the discussion. This could be a tactic to deflect attention or gather information quickly, which might indicate she has something to hide.
> **Dragos:** Semira, you jumped in pretty quickly to ask for roles. Are you just trying to get the conversation started, or is there something more to it?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos' quick claim and deflection onto me raises some red flags. If he's a Villager, he shouldn't be so quick to cast suspicion without any evidence. This could be a tactic to throw us off the scent if he's actually a Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Dragos, your quick claim of Villager and immediate suspicion of me seems a bit too eager to deflect attention. What do you have to say about that?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's silence could mean he's trying to stay under the radar. It's important to get everyone involved in the discussion to gather more information and identify potential Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Alright, Lucian, you've been pretty quiet so far. What's your role in all of this? We need everyone to contribute if we're going to figure this out.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself. Claiming to be a Mason and involving another player (Kraven) in my lie serves multiple purposes: it makes me seem more trustworthy, potentially causes confusion if Kraven denies it, and might reveal if Kraven is actually a Mason or another role. This also indirectly casts suspicion on Semira and Dragos, who have been questioning each other, as potential Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Lucian:** Well, since you asked, Dragos, I'm actually one of the Masons. I woke up during the night and saw that Kraven is the other Mason. This is pretty crucial information, as it means we can trust each other. What do you think about that, Kraven? Can you confirm?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian is lying about being a Mason and trying to create a false trust circle. This is suspicious and suggests he may be a Werewolf or Minion. By calling him out on his false claim, I aim to expose his deceit and rally the true Villagers to vote against him.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, that's quite a bold claim you're making there about being a Mason and seeing me as the other Mason. I can tell you right now, I woke up alone. So, Lucian, there's absolutely no way you saw me as a Mason because the other Mason card is in the center.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to maintain my lie about being a Mason while also casting doubt on Kraven's credibility. By suggesting he might have missed seeing me or implying there could be another reason for his denial, I'm attempting to sow confusion and keep suspicion off myself. This also indirectly paints Kraven as potentially untrustworthy or confused, which could make the others less likely to believe him if he accuses me later. Additionally, this response keeps the focus on our 'Mason dispute' rather than allowing others to scrutinize my claim too closely.
> **Lucian:** Whoa, Kraven, that's a pretty strong accusation you're making there. Are you absolutely certain you woke up alone? Because I distinctly remember seeing you during the Mason phase. Is it possible you might have dozed off and missed it? Or... could there be another explanation for why you're denying this?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos quickly claimed to be a Villager and immediately started casting suspicion on others. This, combined with Lucian's blatant lie about being a Mason, suggests that Dragos might be trying to cover for Lucian. By targeting Dragos, I aim to get more information and possibly expose another Werewolf or Minion.
> **Kraven:** Dragos, your claim of being a Villager was very quick, and you've been trying to deflect suspicion onto Semira. What's more, Lucian is outright lying about being a Mason and seeing me as the other Mason. I woke up alone as the only Mason, which means the other Mason card is in the center. This makes me highly suspicious of both of you. Dragos, what's your defense?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira was quick to start the conversation but hasn't disclosed her role. Her response could shed light on the conflicting Mason claims between Lucian and Kraven and help us identify inconsistencies.
> **Dragos:** Kraven, I'm having a hard time reconciling your claim with Lucian's. Lucian says he saw you as the other Mason, but you've outright denied it. One of you is definitely lying. Semira, you've been vocal but haven't revealed anything about your role yet. Could you share your role with us? This might help us piece things together.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven and Lucian's conflicting Mason claims are critical. By pressing Kraven, we can see if his reasoning holds up better than Lucian's or if he slips up, indicating he might be a Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Kraven, your strong denial of being seen as the other Mason by Lucian is very intriguing. Either you're lying or Lucian is. Since both of you can't be telling the truth, we need to get to the bottom of this. Kraven, why should we trust your claim over Lucian's?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Lucian is lying about being a Mason and Dragos quickly claimed Villager without much evidence, it's crucial to hear from Semira. Her role might help clarify the situation and expose the real Werewolves or Minion. If she is the Seer or another Villager, we can narrow down our suspicions more effectively.
> **Kraven:** Semira, you haven't revealed your role yet, and it could be the key to resolving this. What role did you have during the night?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to get to the bottom of this conflicting Mason claim. By pressing Kraven for more details, we can see if his reasoning holds up or if he slips up, which might indicate he's lying and possibly a Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Kraven, you've made some strong accusations against both Dragos and Lucian. If you're really the only Mason, can you give us more details about your reasoning? Why do you think Lucian would lie about seeing you as the other Mason?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira’s role is crucial in resolving the conflicting claims between me and Lucian. If she’s the Seer or another Villager, it will help us narrow down our suspicions and potentially expose the real Werewolves or Minion. Her hesitation to reveal her role is suspicious and needs to be addressed.
> **Kraven:** Semira, your neutrality so far is not helping us get any closer to the truth. You’ve been vocal but evasive. It’s time you reveal your role. Are you a Villager, Seer, or something else?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm trying to dissect the conflicting Mason claims to identify any inconsistencies or slips. This will help us determine who might be lying and lead us closer to identifying the Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's break this down logically. We have conflicting claims between Lucian and Kraven about the Mason role. Lucian, you claim you saw Kraven as the other Mason, but Kraven insists he woke up alone. One of you must be lying, and it’s crucial to figure out who. If Kraven is telling the truth, then Lucian might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to stir confusion. If Lucian is telling the truth, Kraven might be the liar. We need more information.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian's false claim about being a Mason and seeing me as the other Mason makes him highly suspicious. By confronting him directly, I aim to expose his deceit and rally the true Villagers to vote against him.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, your claim about seeing me as the other Mason is absolutely false. There's no way you could have seen me because I woke up alone. I believe you are either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to create confusion. We need to keep our eyes on you because your lie is a clear indication of foul play.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and onto others. By questioning Kraven's motives and suggesting he might be the Minion or a Werewolf, I'm attempting to sow doubt about his credibility. This also serves to maintain my false claim of being a Mason while casting suspicion on someone else. Additionally, by mentioning the Minion, I'm indirectly suggesting that there might be Werewolves in play, which could make the others less likely to suspect me. This approach allows me to stay on the offensive while appearing to contribute to the village's cause.
> **Lucian:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting sidetracked here. Kraven's aggressive accusations against me are clearly an attempt to divert attention from himself. Why is he so adamant about denying being a Mason? It's possible he's the Minion trying to create chaos, or even a Werewolf himself. We should be looking at his behavior more closely.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira's hesitation to reveal her role is suspicious and needs to be addressed. If she is the Seer or another Villager, it will help us narrow down our suspicions and potentially expose the real Werewolves or Minion.
> **Kraven:** Semira, you've been very evasive about your role. If you're truly on the side of the Villagers, now is the time to reveal your role. Are you the Seer or another Villager? Your role could help us clear up this mess.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's aggressive behavior and constant accusations without solid evidence are classic signs of deflection. If he's truly a Mason, there should be no need for such hostility. This makes me suspect he might be the Minion or even a Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Kraven, your strong denial and constant accusations are making me suspicious. If you truly woke up alone as the only Mason, why are you so aggressively targeting Lucian? What if you're the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's aggressive and consistent denial of being seen as the other Mason, combined with his constant accusations and evasiveness, makes him highly suspicious. If he truly were the lone Mason, there would be no need for such hostility. His behavior is more indicative of someone trying to create confusion and deflect attention, suggesting he might be the Minion or even a Werewolf. Voting for Kraven is the best move to clear up the conflicting Mason claims and uncover the truth.
> **Semira [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's claim of being a Mason and seeing Kraven is contradicted by Kraven's strong assertion of waking up alone. Kraven has been consistent and adamant about his claim, which makes Lucian's contradictory claim highly suspicious. Lucian is likely either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to create confusion and protect the real Werewolves. Hence, voting for Lucian seems the most logical choice to potentially expose a Werewolf or disrupt their strategy.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian falsely claimed to be a Mason and to have seen me as the other Mason. Since I am the only Mason and woke up alone, his claim is a clear lie. This indicates that Lucian is either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to create confusion. His deceitful behavior makes him the most suspicious player and voting for him increases the chances of eliminating a threat to the village.
> **Kraven [Mason]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate potential threats. Kraven has been the most vocal in accusing me, which makes him dangerous. By voting for him, I'm maintaining my false Mason claim while potentially eliminating a villager. This could also sow more confusion and mistrust among the remaining players, which benefits my position as a Werewolf. Additionally, if Kraven is indeed a Mason or another important village role, eliminating him would be a significant win for the Werewolf team.
> **Lucian [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian and Kraven have conflicting claims about the Mason role. Kraven's consistent denial and Lucian's persistence in claiming he saw Kraven make Lucian's story seem more dubious. If Kraven is indeed telling the truth about waking up alone, it implies Lucian might be lying and could be a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Kraven : Mason : 2
* Lucian : Werewolf : 3



>***GAME:*** Lucian was killed. The villagers win.
