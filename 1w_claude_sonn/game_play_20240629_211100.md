## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexia. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Alexandra is a minion and is aware that Alexia is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Larisa. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Vladimir. They are thinking about their action.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather information about which roles are not in play. This can help narrow down the possibilities of who might be a Werewolf or Minion among the players, providing valuable information to the village team.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know that the other Mason card is in the center. We need to gather information from everyone to identify inconsistencies in their claims, which might help us spot the Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Larisa:** I am convinced there's a Werewolf among us! We've got to start by hearing from everyone who they claim to be.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By claiming to be a villager and expressing concern about finding the werewolf, I'm trying to blend in with the village team. Asking about suspicious activities during the night might help me identify the Seer or other special roles without revealing my own identity. It's also a general enough question that doesn't put me in the spotlight.
> **Alexia:** Listen, everyone, I know we're all on edge, but let's not jump to conclusions. As a villager, I'm just as concerned about finding the werewolf as anyone else. But we need to be smart about this. Has anyone seen anything suspicious during the night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I want to create confusion and misdirection. By calling for the Seer to reveal themselves, I hope to identify the Seer and potentially get them targeted, while also creating a distraction that keeps the attention off Alexia, the Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's think carefully about this. Remember, there are three potential Werewolves among us, and we need to narrow it down. I think it's crucial for anyone who has special information to come forward now. If someone is the Seer, for example, they should share what they saw. We're running out of time to figure this out.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I know there's a Mason and Villager in the center, anyone claiming to be a Mason is lying. We need to figure out who might be bluffing.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, let's get this moving. I'm quite sure that the Mason and Villager roles are in the center. That means we can rule out anyone claiming to be a Mason. So, Larisa, what role are you claiming to be?


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's assertion that both Mason and Villager roles are in the center seems suspicious because as the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. I want to understand why Vladimir is so confident and see if I can catch him in a lie.
> **Larisa:** Vladimir, you seem very confident in ruling out Mason and Villager roles. How can you be so sure about that? What did you see during the night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I have seen the Mason and Villager cards in the center, I know these roles are not in play. Larisa's insistence on hearing from everyone could be a tactic to buy time, so I want to challenge her directly to see how she reacts.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, Larisa, I'll be transparent. I am the Seer, and during the night, I saw two center cards – a Mason and a Villager. This means anyone claiming to be a Mason is definitely lying. So, Larisa, what role are you claiming to be?


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know there's just one Mason card in the center. Vladimir's confident assertion seems off, raising suspicion about his true role. By challenging his statement, I may uncover inconsistencies and potentially expose him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Larisa:** Vladimir, your claim of being the Seer who saw a Mason and a Villager in the center doesn't add up to me. We only have one Mason card in the center, and I'm certain of it. Can you explain why you're so confident?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By targeting Alexia first, we can verify the consistency of her claim. If she hesitates or changes her story, it could indicate she's not truthful.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, let's focus. Since I know there's a Mason and a Villager in the center, we can catch any lies. Alexia, you claimed Villager. With one Villager in the center, why are you so certain of your role?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and sow discord among the other players. By questioning Vladimir's claim, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm presenting myself as observant and logical, which a Villager would do. 2) I'm casting doubt on the supposed Seer, which could help protect me if Vladimir actually is the Seer. 3) I'm subtly accusing Vladimir of being the Werewolf, which could lead to his elimination instead of mine. This move also helps me identify potential allies - if anyone strongly defends Vladimir, they might be the Minion.
> **Alexia:** Vladimir, I appreciate your claim of being the Seer, but something doesn't add up. You say you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, but we only have one Mason card in play. This inconsistency is alarming. Are you sure you're not trying to mislead us? Maybe you're the Werewolf trying to create confusion!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexia's inconsistency and aggressive stance against my claim as the Seer raise suspicions. By pressing her for more information, we might be able to catch her in a lie or confirm her role.
> **Vladimir:** Alexia, you're throwing a lot of suspicion my way, but I'm confident in my role as the Seer. You're claiming to be a Villager, but with one Villager in the center, it's a risky claim. What if you're the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves? Can you provide any more information to back up your claim?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and Vladimir, who's under suspicion. By questioning Alexandra, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm presenting myself as observant and strategic, which aligns with my Villager claim. 2) I'm shifting the focus to a new target, potentially saving myself and creating more confusion. 3) I'm subtly implying that Alexandra might be the Minion or a Werewolf, which could lead to her elimination instead of mine. This move also helps me gauge other players' reactions - if anyone strongly defends Alexandra, they might be on the village team.
> **Alexia:** Hold on a minute, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in Vladimir's claim. Let's take a step back and consider something else. Alexandra, you've been awfully quiet. You mentioned earlier that there are three potential Werewolves among us. That's quite specific. How did you come to that conclusion? It almost sounds like you might have some inside information...


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** Alexia's behavior seems very suspicious to me. By accusing her, I can take some heat off myself and also protect her as my Werewolf ally by making it seem like I'm genuinely suspecting her. This adds to the confusion and makes it harder for the other players to trust each other.
> **Alexandra:** Alexia, you've been throwing around accusations and trying to shift the focus a lot. I've been observing this game closely, and it seems like you're trying to create confusion. If we're going to find the Werewolf, we need to look at who's being the most disruptive. I think you might be the Werewolf.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to defend myself against Alexandra's accusation while also redirecting suspicion. By questioning Alexandra's motives and pointing out her sudden change in behavior, I'm attempting to cast doubt on her credibility. This serves multiple purposes: 1) It helps me maintain my facade as a concerned Villager. 2) It keeps the suspicion off me by presenting Alexandra as a potential threat. 3) It continues to sow discord among the other players, making it harder for them to identify the real Werewolf (me). Additionally, by bringing up Vladimir's inconsistent claim again, I'm subtly reinforcing the idea that he might be untrustworthy, which could be useful later if I need to deflect attention again.
> **Alexia:** Hold on a second, Alexandra! You're accusing me of being disruptive, but I've been trying to get to the bottom of this just like everyone else. If anyone's been creating confusion, it's Vladimir with his inconsistent Seer claim. And now you're suddenly pointing fingers at me? That's awfully convenient. I think we need to consider the possibility that you might be the Werewolf trying to deflect attention. Can you explain why you've been so quiet until now, and why you're suddenly so eager to accuse me?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** By drawing attention to Larisa and questioning her skepticism towards Vladimir's claim, I can create further doubt and confusion among the players. This helps divert attention away from Alexia, my Werewolf ally, and keeps the focus on other players.
> **Alexandra:** Larisa, you seem to be questioning Vladimir's Seer claim quite a bit. Considering Vladimir's confidence, I'm finding your skepticism a bit suspicious. You haven't clearly stated your role yet. What role are you claiming, and why are you so certain about the Mason card being in the center?


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra's behavior of staying quiet and then suddenly accusing Alexia seems suspicious. We need to understand her motives and see if we can catch her in a lie or inconsistency that might expose her true role.
> **Larisa:** Alexandra, your sudden accusation of Alexia and your quiet demeanor until now raise red flags for me. Why did you wait so long to speak up, and why are you so quick to divert suspicion onto Alexia?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing attention to Larisa and questioning her skepticism, I can create doubt and confusion among the players. This diversifies suspicion and keeps the focus away from Alexia, my Werewolf ally. It helps to maintain chaos and mistrust among the Villagers, making it harder for them to unite against the Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Larisa, you're questioning Vladimir's Seer claim quite heavily, and it's starting to look suspicious. If Vladimir truly saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, then why are you so confident about the Mason card being there? Can you tell us what role you are claiming? I think it's important for us to get your role out in the open.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know one of the Mason cards is in the center, not both. Vladimir's claim as the Seer seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center is inconsistent with my information. This raises suspicion about Vladimir's true role, possibly indicating he's a Werewolf or Minion trying to throw us off.
> **Larisa:** Vladimir, your claim of being the Seer seems very questionable given the information we've gathered. If you truly saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, why does that contradict what I know for sure? I believe you're trying to mislead us, and that makes you a prime suspect for being a Werewolf!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Larisa's persistent skepticism towards my Seer claim and her reluctance to reveal her own role make her a prime suspect. By directly questioning her, we might uncover inconsistencies or force her into making a concrete claim that can be scrutinized.
> **Vladimir:** Larisa, your aggressive questioning and attempts to sow doubt about my Seer claim are highly suspicious. Given that you haven't clearly stated your role, it feels like you're trying to deflect attention away from yourself. What role are you claiming, and why are you so certain about the Mason card being in the center?


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra's behavior of staying quiet and then suddenly accusing Alexia seems suspicious. We need to understand her motives and see if we can catch her in a lie or inconsistency that might expose her true role.
> **Larisa:** Alexandra, your sudden turn to accuse Alexia and your quiet demeanor until now are very suspicious to me. You've been sitting back and observing, and then you suddenly jump into the fray with accusations. What role are you claiming, and why did you wait so long to speak up?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** Larisa's evasive behavior and continuous questioning of Vladimir's credibility are raising red flags. By pressing her to reveal her role, I can create more doubt and suspicion around her, which helps protect Alexia, the Werewolf, by shifting attention away from her.
> **Alexandra:** Larisa, you're being very defensive and dodging direct questions about your role. Given Vladimir's Seer claim and the information he's provided, I'm inclined to believe him. But your insistence on questioning him makes me think you might be hiding something. So, Larisa, what role did you have during the night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's claim of being the Seer and seeing both a Mason and a Villager in the center is inconsistent with my knowledge as the only Mason, knowing one Mason card is in the center. His confident assertion despite this discrepancy makes me suspect he might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Larisa [Mason]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and eliminate a villager. Larisa has been particularly suspicious of Vladimir's Seer claim and hasn't clearly stated her own role. By voting for Larisa, I'm hoping to eliminate a potential threat to my survival while maintaining my cover as a concerned villager. Additionally, her questioning of Vladimir aligns with my earlier strategy of casting doubt on his claim, which helps reinforce my position without drawing too much attention to myself.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** Given the information provided, Larisa has been evasive about her role and has heavily questioned Vladimir's Seer claim without providing clear evidence to counter it. This suspicious behavior makes her a likely target, and my goal as the Minion is to create doubt and confusion to protect Alexia, the Werewolf.
> **Alexandra [Minion]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Larisa's persistent skepticism towards my Seer claim, combined with her reluctance to reveal her own role and her attempts to deflect attention, make her the most suspicious candidate. Given the information I have as the Seer, voting for Larisa seems the best course of action to eliminate a potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Vladimir [Seer]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's claim of being the Seer and seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center seems inconsistent, as there should be only one Mason in the center. His aggressive questioning also raises suspicion. Additionally, his insistence on focusing on others without much evidence makes me believe he could be a Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


The votes were:
* Larisa : Mason : 3
* Vladimir : Seer : 2



>***GAME:*** Larisa was killed. The werewolves win.
