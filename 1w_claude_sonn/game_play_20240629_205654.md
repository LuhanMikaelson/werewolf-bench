## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. Dracula hasn't been mentioned recently, so he's a good target. By questioning his silence, I'm implying that he might be hiding something, which could make others suspicious of him. This also makes me appear proactive in finding the werewolves, which is how a villager would act. Additionally, by targeting someone who's been quiet, I'm encouraging more discussion, which gives me more opportunities to gather information and manipulate the conversation.
> **Michael:** Hey everyone, I've been thinking... Dracula has been awfully quiet this whole time. Don't you think that's a bit suspicious? I mean, if he were a villager or someone on our side, wouldn't he be more eager to help us find the werewolves?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** By getting people to reveal their roles, we can start piecing together the puzzle and identify any inconsistencies that might point us to the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Hey everyone, let's not get too hasty with accusations. We should hear what roles people claim to be first. Does anyone want to start by sharing what role they have?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to start the conversation by providing truthful information that can help the Villagers. By revealing that I'm a Mason and the other Mason card is in the center, we can eliminate confusion regarding the Mason role and focus on identifying the Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** Alright, everyone, let's get some clarity here. I'm a Mason and I didn't see another Mason last night, which means the other Mason card is in the center. This should help us narrow down some options. Who else is willing to share their role?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael was quick to cast suspicion on Dracula, which could be a deflection tactic if he's trying to hide something. It's worth pressing him to see if his story adds up.
> **Dragos:** Alright, given that Mircea claims to be a Mason and saw no other Mason, that means there are potentially two Masons in the center. If that's true, it leaves us with fewer suspects. I'm curious though, Michael, what role are you claiming? You've been quite eager to point fingers.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover as a Villager. By claiming to be a Villager, I'm choosing a role that's hard to disprove and doesn't draw too much attention. I'm also deflecting Dragos' question back at him, which keeps the focus off me and potentially gives me more information to work with. Additionally, by slightly questioning Mircea's claim without being too aggressive, I'm sowing seeds of doubt that could be useful later if I need to cast suspicion on him.
> **Michael:** Well, Dragos, since you're asking, I'm actually a Villager. I know it's not the most exciting role, but it's honest work, right? I've been trying to piece things together based on what everyone's saying. Mircea's claim about being a Mason is interesting, but we can't just take everyone's word at face value. What about you, Dragos? What role are you claiming to be?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's initial accusation of Dracula without much basis seems like a deflection tactic. If he were truly a Villager, he would likely be more cautious and collaborative. Pressing him on this might reveal inconsistencies or clarify his true intentions.
> **Dragos:** Alright, Michael, your eagerness to cast suspicion on Dracula seems a bit off to me. If you're truly a Villager as you claim, why were you so quick to point fingers without first trying to gather more information?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting the question back to Dragos, I'm deflecting suspicion away from myself and putting pressure on him. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear proactive and interested in uncovering information (like a genuine Villager would be), it keeps the focus off my earlier accusation of Dracula, and it potentially reveals more information about Dragos' role. If Dragos claims to be a powerful role like the Seer, I can use this information later to potentially sway votes against him. If he claims to be a Villager, I can use that to create doubt about his questioning of me. Either way, this response helps me maintain my cover as a Villager while gathering more information to use in the game.
> **Michael:** Hold on a second, Dragos. I was just trying to get the conversation started and encourage everyone to share information. As a Villager, I'm naturally concerned about finding the Werewolves. But you're right, we should all be sharing. So, what about you? You've been pretty quick to question others, but you haven't told us your role yet. Care to share with the group?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's silence and his call for role sharing without offering any information himself is suspicious. Pressing him for his role might reveal inconsistencies or force him to make a move.
> **Dragos:** Dracula, you've been pretty quiet so far and only suggested we share roles. What role are you claiming to be?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's eagerness to accuse me and his defense of his Villager claim seems a bit too proactive. I need to understand his reasoning and see if it holds up. This might help reveal if he's bluffing or genuinely trying to find Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Alright, Michael, let's take a step back. You were quick to point fingers at me for being quiet, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm a Werewolf. You've also been very vocal without providing much useful information. What exactly makes you so sure that I'm suspicious?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and onto others. By apologizing to Dracula, I'm showing that I'm reasonable and not blindly accusatory, which aligns with how a Villager might act. Shifting focus to Dragos serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me, potentially exposes more information about Dragos' role, and sows discord among the other players. If Dragos is indeed a powerful role like the Seer, getting others to doubt him could be very beneficial for me. Additionally, by framing my suspicion as concern for the group, I'm portraying myself as a team player, further cementing my facade as a Villager.
> **Michael:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting a bit off track here. Dracula, I apologize if I came across as accusatory earlier. I was just trying to get everyone talking. But now, I'm more concerned about Dragos. He's been very quick to question others, especially me, but has been oddly evasive about his own role. Dragos, why are you so reluctant to share your role with us? It's making me wonder if you might be the one we should be worried about.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been quiet and hasn't shared his role despite suggesting it. Michael's eagerness to accuse others without sharing much about himself also seems suspicious. Clarifying Dracula's role might help us get closer to the truth.
> **Dragos:** Dracula, you were the first to suggest role-sharing but haven't shared your role yourself. I find it strange that Michael was quick to accuse you, and now he's trying to deflect suspicion onto me. What role do you claim to be?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's claim about being the only Mason makes sense, but Dragos has been deflecting questions and accusations. We need to understand his role to piece this puzzle together.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, I've been thinking about what we've heard so far. Mircea claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which means the other Mason card is in the center. That sounds reasonable, but what about Dragos? You've been quick to question others but haven't shared your role. Dragos, what role do you claim to be?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been quiet and hasn't shared his role despite suggesting it earlier. Pressing him for his role might reveal inconsistencies or force him to make a move.
> **Dragos:** Dracula, you've been very evasive. You were the first to suggest role sharing, but you still haven't told us what role you claim to be. It's time to stop deflecting and be honest with us. What role are you claiming?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's claim about being the only Mason seems credible, but Dragos has been deflecting questions and accusations. We need to get a clear answer from Dragos to piece this puzzle together and identify if there's any inconsistency.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, listen up! We need to get more clarity here. Mircea has claimed to be the Mason and didn't see another Mason, which means the other Mason is in the center. Dragos, you still haven't clearly stated your role. Why are you being so evasive? What role do you claim to have?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been avoiding sharing his role despite suggesting role sharing. This evasiveness is suspicious and could indicate he's hiding something. Pressing him for his role might reveal inconsistencies or force him to make a move.
> **Dragos:** Mircea, you've been consistent with your claim of being a Mason, and that should help us narrow things down. But I'm really puzzled by Dracula's evasiveness. If Dracula truly has nothing to hide, why hasn't he been clear about his role? Dracula, it's time to come clean. What role do you claim to be?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Gathering more information from Dragos is crucial because his evasive behavior and deflection of questions make him the most suspicious right now. If he can't provide a convincing answer, it might indicate that he's a werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Alright, let's cut to the chase. Dragos, you've been very evasive about your role and quick to deflect questions. If you have nothing to hide, this is your chance to come clean. What role do you claim to be?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's evasiveness and lack of transparency are highly suspicious. Pressing him to reveal his role could either clarify his true intentions or expose inconsistencies in his story, helping us identify potential Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Dracula, you've been very evasive this whole time. You were the first to suggest role sharing but haven't shared your own role yet. It's time to stop deflecting and be honest with us. What role do you claim to be?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Given that Mircea's claim to be the Mason seems credible and Michael has been quite vocal but consistent, Dragos' evasive behavior stands out the most. It's crucial to understand his role to see if there are any inconsistencies that might point to him being the Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, Dragos has been very quick to question others and deflect suspicions without ever stating his own role. Dragos, you've been very evasive and it's making me suspicious. Are you a Werewolf trying to hide in plain sight?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's initial accusation of Dracula without much basis seems like a deflection tactic. If he were truly a Villager, he would likely be more cautious and collaborative. Pressing him on this might reveal inconsistencies or clarify his true intentions.
> **Dragos:** Michael, your eagerness to accuse Dracula without much basis and now trying to deflect suspicion onto me seems highly suspicious. Why were you so quick to point fingers without first trying to gather more information?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and the ongoing suspicion between Dragos and Dracula. By bringing up Mircea's claim again, I'm validating it without committing to believing it entirely, which makes me seem like I'm trying to piece things together logically. Targeting Cristina, who hasn't spoken much, serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me, potentially reveals more information about another player's role, and makes me appear proactive in the discussion. If Cristina claims a powerful role like the Seer, it gives me a potential target for later. If she claims to be a Villager, it adds another layer of complexity to the game, potentially creating more confusion that I can exploit. Either way, this move helps maintain my cover as a Villager while gathering more information to use in the game.
> **Michael:** Hold on a second, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in this back-and-forth between Dragos and Dracula. Let's not forget that Mircea claimed to be a Mason, which is a pretty important piece of information. If that's true, it narrows down our options significantly. Cristina, you've been awfully quiet this whole time. What do you make of all this, and more importantly, what role are you claiming to be?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention from myself and eliminate potential threats. Dragos has been very vocal in questioning others, especially me, which could lead to my exposure. By voting for him, I'm not only removing a potential threat but also aligning myself with the suspicions raised by others, particularly Dracula. This makes me appear as if I'm working with the group to eliminate suspicious players, further cementing my facade as a Villager. Additionally, Dragos' evasiveness about his own role provides a plausible justification for my vote, making it seem less like a targeted attack and more like a logical decision based on the information available.
> **Michael [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been evasive and has not claimed a role despite suggesting role-sharing. This behavior is highly suspicious and inconsistent with someone trying to help the villagers. Given that I am a Mason and the other Mason is in the center, I find it plausible that Dracula is hiding something, potentially being a Werewolf.
> **Mircea [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's eagerness to accuse Dracula without much basis and his quick deflection attempts throughout the day seem highly suspicious. If Mircea's claim of being the Mason is true, it helps narrow down the suspects, and Michael's behavior makes him a prime candidate for a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael has been the most vocal and proactive in pointing fingers without much substantive reasoning. His eagerness to accuse me and then deflect suspicion onto Dragos seems suspicious. Mircea's claim about being a Mason seems consistent, and Dragos' behavior appears more defensive than deceptive. Therefore, Michael's actions make him the most likely suspect.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been evasive and has not clearly stated his role despite repeated questioning. This behavior is highly suspicious, especially given that we have a claimed Mason (Mircea) who saw no other Mason. Dragos's reluctance to share makes me believe he could be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


The votes were:
* Michael : Werewolf : 2
* Dragos : Villager : 2
* Dracula : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Michael, Dragos. The villagers win.
