## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Mircea. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Andrei. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Kraven. They are thinking about their action.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me more information about the roles that are not in play, which can help narrow down the possibilities and make it easier to detect lies during the DAY phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.


---

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather information early on from another player. If Mircea is telling the truth, it could help us narrow down possibilities. If he lies, inconsistencies might emerge later.
> **Cristina:** Alright, let's get things rolling! Mircea, what role did you see in the center if you used a night ability, or what do you claim your role to be?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. Claiming to be a Villager is a safe bet, as it's a common role and doesn't require me to provide any special information. By asking if anyone else saw or did anything, I'm trying to gather information about potential Seers or Masons without directly asking about those roles. This also helps me appear interested and engaged in finding the Werewolves, which is what a true Villager would do.
> **Mircea:** Well, since you're asking, Cristina, I can confidently say that I'm a Villager. I didn't have any special abilities to use during the night phase, so I can't provide any information about the center cards. But I'm curious, did anyone here actually see or do anything interesting last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. By targeting Andrei, who hasn't spoken much, I'm creating suspicion around him. This serves two purposes: it makes me appear proactive in finding the Werewolves (which a Villager would do), and it potentially puts pressure on a player who might be a Seer or Mason. If Andrei is forced to reveal information, it could help me identify key players to target later. Additionally, by asking about his role and night actions, I'm fishing for information that could be useful in maintaining my cover as a Villager.
> **Mircea:** You know, I've been observing everyone's behavior, and something about Andrei seems off. He's been awfully quiet, hasn't he? Andrei, care to explain what your role is and what you did last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea's sudden accusation of me seems suspicious, especially when I know he's lying about being a Villager since I know the Mason card is in the center. It's important to reveal this to focus our attention on possible Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Alright Mircea, interesting that you're calling me out. I'm actually a Mason, and I didn't see another Mason last night, so the other Mason card is definitely in the center. This should help us narrow things down.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover while also sowing doubt. By acknowledging Andrei's information but expressing mild suspicion, I appear engaged and thoughtful without directly accusing anyone. Asking Cristina's opinion serves multiple purposes: it deflects attention from me, potentially reveals more information about Cristina's role, and creates an opportunity for debate that could divide the villagers. If Cristina is the Seer or the other Mason, this question might prompt her to reveal information that could be useful to me later. If she's a Villager or the Minion, her response might help me identify potential allies or targets for the final vote.
> **Mircea:** Interesting, Andrei. So you're claiming to be a Mason, and you say the other Mason card is in the center. That's valuable information, but it also makes me a bit suspicious. If you're telling the truth, that means we have one less villager role in play than we thought. Cristina, what do you think about this? Do you find Andrei's claim believable?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** It's essential to gather more information about other players' roles and actions to verify Andrei's claim and to start piecing together the puzzle.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, your claim of being a Mason is interesting. If you're telling the truth, then we have one less villager role in play. So, let's see if anyone else claims to have seen or done something last night. Kraven, what role did you have, and did you do anything during the night phase?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei's claim matches with the information I've seen. Now I'm trying to clarify Mircea's role and see if there are inconsistencies in his story.
> **Kraven:** Alright, everyone, listen up! Andrei's claim about being a Mason and seeing no other Mason aligns with what I know. I saw the Minion and Mason cards in the center, so Andrei must be telling the truth. That means we should focus on finding the Werewolves. Mircea, you said you're a Villager, but I'm not convinced. Why should we believe you?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect Kraven's accusation without seeming defensive. By questioning his logic and pointing out the roles we've accounted for, I'm subtly suggesting that he might be lying about being the Seer. This could sow doubt among the other players. Additionally, by targeting Dracula, who hasn't spoken yet, I'm both diverting attention away from myself and potentially forcing out information about another player's role. If Dracula claims to be a Villager, it could support my own claim. If he claims a special role, it might contradict Kraven's statement, which would be beneficial for me. Either way, getting Dracula to speak up takes the focus off me and gives me more information to work with.
> **Mircea:** Whoa, hold on there, Kraven! That's quite an accusation. I understand your suspicion, but let's think about this logically. If I were a Werewolf, wouldn't I have tried to cast suspicion on someone else right from the start? Instead, I've been trying to gather information and contribute to the discussion. Plus, if you're the Seer as you're implying, that means we have a Seer, a Mason, and a Werewolf accounted for. That leaves very few options for the remaining players. Dracula, you've been awfully quiet. What's your take on all this? What role did you get, and did you do anything during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has been very vocal and accusatory, which could be a sign of deflection. It's important to clarify his actions during the night to see if he slips up or reveals any inconsistencies.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and consider the situation. We have Andrei claiming to be a Mason, and Kraven stating he saw the Minion and Mason cards in the center. This seems to check out. Now, I'm curious about Mircea. You've been pointing fingers a lot. Mircea, can you provide any more specific details about what you did last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself while also casting doubt on others. By questioning the sudden alliance between Dracula and Kraven, I'm creating suspicion about their roles without directly accusing them of being Werewolves. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear proactive in finding potential threats (which a villager would do), it sows discord among the other players, and it potentially puts pressure on Dracula and Kraven to reveal more information. Additionally, by suggesting that Dracula might be the Minion, I'm subtly hinting at a possible werewolf presence without implicating myself. This could also help protect the actual Minion if they exist, as they are my potential ally.
> **Mircea:** Look, Dracula, I understand your suspicion, but I've been trying to gather information and contribute to the discussion, just like any villager would. Last night, I simply went to sleep like any normal villager. I didn't have any special abilities to use. What's interesting is that you've been very quiet until now, and suddenly you're backing up Kraven's claim. Are you two working together? Maybe you're the Minion supporting a fake Seer claim? I think we need to be careful about trusting anyone too quickly here.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's behavior has been consistently aggressive and accusatory. This can often be a tactic used by a Werewolf or Minion to deflect suspicion away from themselves and create chaos among the villagers.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, let's not get too distracted here. Mircea has been very vocal and accusatory, which might be a tactic to deflect suspicion. It seems like he's trying to steer the conversation away from himself. I think we need to consider that Mircea might be the Minion or even a Werewolf.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's sudden alignment with Kraven's claim seems suspicious. We need to understand his role and actions to determine if he is being truthful or if he's trying to mislead us.
> **Andrei:** Alright, Dracula, you've been quiet and now you're suddenly backing up Kraven's claim. What role did you get, and did you see anything during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's aggressive behavior and accusations could be an attempt to deflect suspicion away from themselves. It's important to get more specific details from Mircea to see if there are any inconsistencies in their story.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, here's what I'm thinking. Andrei has claimed to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which aligns with Kraven's claim of seeing the Minion and Mason cards in the center. This makes Kraven and Andrei's claims quite consistent. Now, Mircea has been very vocal and accusatory, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion. It's quite possible that Mircea is trying to create confusion to hide their true role. Mircea, you're under the spotlight right now. Can you explain why you were so quick to point fingers?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By turning the tables on Dracula and pointing out that he hasn't revealed his role yet, I'm creating doubt about his intentions. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the focus off me, makes me appear proactive in seeking information (like a villager would), and potentially forces Dracula to reveal information that could be useful to me. If Dracula claims to be a villager, it supports my own claim. If he claims a special role, it might contradict previous statements, which would be beneficial for me. Either way, this move buys me time and shifts the suspicion onto someone else.
> **Mircea:** Hold on a second, everyone. I think we're getting a bit sidetracked here. Dracula, you're suddenly very vocal and accusing me of being a Werewolf or Minion, but you still haven't told us your role or what you did during the night. That seems pretty suspicious to me. Why don't you share that information with us before pointing fingers?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's behavior has been consistently accusatory and aggressive, which might be a tactic to divert attention. We need to get more specific details from Mircea to see if there are any inconsistencies in their story that might reveal their true role.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let's break this down logically. We have Andrei claiming to be a Mason, and Kraven stating he saw the Minion and Mason cards in the center. This checks out so far. Mircea, you've been pointing fingers a lot and being quite aggressive. Why should we believe you are just a Villager and not trying to deflect suspicion? This could very well be a tactic from a Werewolf or Minion.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention from myself and create confusion among the villagers. By targeting Cristina, who hasn't revealed much information, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm shifting focus away from myself, 2) I'm appearing proactive in seeking information, which a villager would do, 3) I'm potentially forcing Cristina to reveal information that could be useful to me, and 4) I'm creating doubt about a player who hasn't been under suspicion yet. If Cristina claims to be a villager, it supports my own claim. If she claims a special role, it might contradict previous statements, which would be beneficial for me. Additionally, by framing my statement as a call for unity and focus, I'm portraying myself as a team player, further distancing myself from suspicion of being a Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting too caught up in accusations without solid evidence. We need to focus on finding the Werewolves, not turning on each other. Cristina has been awfully quiet lately. Cristina, you started this whole discussion, but you haven't shared your role or what you did during the night. Care to enlighten us?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has been very vocal and accusatory, which might be a tactic to deflect suspicion. It's crucial to gather more information and see if Mircea's behavior aligns with that of a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back. If Kraven is truly the Seer and saw the Minion and Mason cards in the center, then we need to focus on finding the Werewolves. Mircea has been very vocal and accusatory, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion. Mircea, you've been pointing fingers a lot and being quite aggressive. Why should we believe you are just a Villager and not trying to deflect suspicion? This could very well be a tactic from a Werewolf or Minion.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and create confusion among the villagers. By accusing Cristina of potentially being the Minion and aligning with Dracula, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm shifting focus away from myself, 2) I'm creating doubt about two players who have been questioning me, 3) I'm sowing discord among the villagers, which benefits the Werewolf team, and 4) I'm appearing proactive in seeking out potential threats, which a villager would do. This move also protects the actual Minion (if there is one) by creating a false lead. Additionally, by questioning the sudden alignment between Cristina and Dracula, I'm subtly suggesting that they might be working together against the village, further muddying the waters and making it harder for the villagers to identify the true Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Cristina, I find it interesting that you're now echoing Dracula's suspicions about me. It seems like you two might be working together. Are you perhaps the Minion supporting Dracula as the Werewolf? Your sudden alignment with him is quite suspicious.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's sudden shift from being quiet to vocal, and his immediate alignment with Kraven, raises red flags. If he's hiding something, it might reveal more about the roles in play and help us identify any Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Dracula, I'm finding your sudden vocalness quite suspicious. You've been backing up Kraven's claims without providing any concrete information about your own role. Can you tell us what role you had and what you did during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** If Andrei is truly a Mason and didn't see another Mason, he might have some insights based on others' behavior. It also gives us a chance to test his responses for consistency.
> **Dracula:** Alright Andrei, you've claimed to be a Mason and you didn't see another Mason. I'm curious, do you have any reason to suspect someone else here, based on their behavior or anything specific you noticed?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has been the most vocal and accusatory, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion away from himself. His behavior is inconsistent with that of a simple Villager and more aligned with the role of a Minion or a Werewolf. Given that Kraven's claim of being the Seer and seeing the Minion and Mason in the center aligns with Andrei's claim of being a Mason, Mircea's actions seem most suspicious.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and eliminate a villager. Cristina has been relatively quiet and hasn't revealed much information, making her an easy target. By voting for her, I'm also creating distance between myself and the accusations against me. This move could potentially eliminate a villager role or force the real Seer or Mason to reveal themselves in the next round, if there is one. Additionally, my previous accusation of Cristina potentially being the Minion aligns with this vote, maintaining consistency in my actions and reducing suspicion on me.
> **Mircea [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea has been very vocal and accusatory throughout the discussion, which seems like a tactic to deflect suspicion. Additionally, his claim of being a Villager doesn't align with the information I have as the Mason, knowing the other Mason card is in the center. Together with Kraven's claim of seeing the Minion and Mason cards in the center, this casts significant doubt on Mircea's claim. Mircea's behavior suggests he could be the Minion or a Werewolf trying to sow confusion.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea has been very vocal and accusatory, which is behavior often seen in someone trying to deflect suspicion. Additionally, Andrei's claim of being a Mason and my confirmation of seeing the Minion and Mason cards in the center cast further doubt on Mircea's claim of being a Villager. Voting for Mircea seems the most logical choice to eliminate a potential threat.
> **Kraven [Seer]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has been very vocal and accusatory throughout the discussion, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion. Andrei's Mason claim aligns with Kraven's Seer claim of seeing the Minion and Mason cards in the center. Therefore, Mircea's behavior seems most consistent with that of a Werewolf or Minion trying to create confusion.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Mircea.


The votes were:
* Cristina : Villager : 1
* Mircea : Werewolf : 4



>***GAME:*** Mircea was killed. The villagers win.
