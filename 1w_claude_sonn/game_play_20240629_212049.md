## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa hasn't contributed much to the discussion yet. By directing a question at her, I can draw her out and see if her response raises any red flags or seems suspicious. If she's a Werewolf, her hesitation or the content of her answer might give her away.
> **Michael:** Larisa, you seem awfully quiet. Do you have something you're hiding?


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to gather more information from other players to identify inconsistencies and potentially find a Werewolf. Directing a question at Andrei might reveal more about his role or help spot any lies.
> **Larisa:** I'm not hiding anything, Michael. But I think we should hear from everyone else too. Andrei, you haven't said much. What role did you wake up with?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Because Michael questioned Larisa, and I want to see if Marius might give himself away or provide information that could help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** I'm a Villager, Larisa. But I'm curious, Marius, what did you wake up as?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself. Claiming to be a Mason is a good strategy because it's a role that's hard to disprove, and it allows me to cast doubt on others. By saying I didn't see another Mason, I'm implying that someone else might be lying about their role. Directing a question to Kraven, who hasn't spoken yet, puts pressure on him and takes attention away from me. This also helps me gather more information about the other players' claimed roles, which can help me identify potential threats like the Seer.
> **Marius:** Well, Andrei, I appreciate your honesty. As for me, I woke up as a Mason. I looked for my fellow Mason but didn't see anyone, so I believe the other Mason card is in the center. This makes me a bit suspicious of everyone else. Kraven, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius's claim of being a Mason without seeing the other Mason could be a tactic to divert suspicion. It's essential to understand his reasoning to determine if he's trustworthy.
> **Kraven:** Marius, you say you're a Mason and didn't see anyone else, but that seems awfully convenient. Why should we believe you?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Kraven's doubt directly and turning the question back on him, I'm attempting to maintain my credibility while also putting pressure on Kraven. This serves multiple purposes: it keeps suspicion away from me, potentially exposes Kraven's role (which could be useful information), and might make Kraven appear more suspicious to others. If Kraven claims to be a Villager or another role that's hard to verify, it could make my Mason claim seem more believable in comparison. Additionally, by emphasizing my 'vulnerability' as a lone Mason, I'm trying to garner sympathy and trust from the other players.
> **Marius:** Kraven, I understand your skepticism, but I assure you I'm being completely honest about my role as a Mason. The fact that I didn't see another Mason actually puts me in a vulnerable position, which is why I'm trying to gather information from everyone. I find it interesting that you're so quick to doubt me instead of sharing your own role. Are you perhaps trying to deflect attention from yourself? What role did you wake up as, and why should we trust your claim?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius's claim could be genuine, but it could also be a tactic to avoid suspicion. Andrei appears innocent, but Michael's quick questioning of Larisa could be a way to deflect attention. Understanding Michael's role might give us more clarity on the situation.
> **Kraven:** Marius, you claim to be a Mason but didn't see anyone else. If that's true, then the other Mason must be in the center. However, it makes me wonder if you're trying to divert attention from yourself. Andrei said he's a Villager, but we haven't heard much from Michael or Larisa. Michael, you seemed quick to question Larisa. What role did you wake up as?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's approach has been very defensive and accusatory without revealing his own role. This could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from himself if he is indeed a Werewolf or Minion. Pressuring him to reveal more could help clarify his intentions.
> **Michael:** Kraven, you seem to be deflecting quite a bit. Could you tell us what your role is and why you are so quick to cast doubt on others?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's quick questioning of Larisa without sharing his own role seems suspicious to me. By pressing him for more information, we might uncover inconsistencies or determine if he's trying to hide something.
> **Kraven:** Michael, you seem very quick to question Larisa. It's almost like you're trying to deflect attention away from yourself. What role did you wake up as?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's evasive responses and his reluctance to reveal his role make him highly suspicious. Pressuring him to disclose his role might expose inconsistencies or push him to slip up if he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Michael:** Kraven, you've been dodging quite a bit and haven't provided your role yet. Are you hiding something? Could you please tell us your role?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's quick questioning of Larisa and his avoidance of sharing his own role seem suspicious. Pressing him for more information might uncover inconsistencies or determine if he's trying to hide something.
> **Kraven:** Michael, you're deflecting quite a bit and haven't provided your role yet. Are you hiding something? Could you please tell us your role?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's evasive responses and his reluctance to reveal his role make him highly suspicious. Pressuring him to disclose his role might expose inconsistencies or push him to slip up if he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Michael:** Kraven, you've been dodging quite a bit and haven't provided your role yet. Are you hiding something? Could you please tell us your role?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's avoidance of sharing his own role and his quick questioning of others makes him look like he's trying to deflect attention from himself. Pressing him for more information might uncover inconsistencies or determine if he's hiding something.
> **Kraven:** Michael, your quick questioning of Larisa without revealing your own role is quite suspicious. Are you trying to hide something? What role did you wake up as?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been quick to question others without providing much information himself. Pressuring him to flesh out his story might reveal inconsistencies if he is hiding something.
> **Michael:** Andrei, you and I both claim to be Villagers, but I notice you're very quick to ask others about their roles without much skepticism. What did you really wake up as?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's deflecting and aggressive questioning make him appear suspicious. It's important to press him for information to determine his true role and see if he slips up, which can help identify if he's the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei:** Michael, you've been pressing quite hard on everyone else without revealing much yourself. Why the insistence? I'm curious to hear what your role is.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's continued evasiveness and refusal to reveal his role make him highly suspicious. As a Villager, it's important to press individuals who are not forthcoming, as they could be hiding a Werewolf role. By targeting Kraven directly, I hope to either catch him in a lie or force him to reveal useful information that could help us. Additionally, his tactic of turning questions back onto others suggests he's trying to deflect suspicion away from himself.
> **Michael:** Kraven, it's interesting how you keep deflecting questions without sharing your own role. You seem very defensive, and that's usually a red flag. Are you trying to hide something?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael has been quick to question others without revealing his own role. This deflection and avoidance are suspicious and could indicate that he is trying to hide something. Pressing him for his role might uncover inconsistencies.
> **Kraven:** Michael, you've been deflecting quite a bit and haven't provided your role yet. Are you hiding something? Could you please tell us your role?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been quick to question others without providing much information himself. Pressuring him to flesh out his story might reveal inconsistencies if he is hiding something. Additionally, his tactic of questioning others might be a way to deflect suspicion from himself if he is a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Michael:** Andrei, you mentioned you're a Villager, but you've been very quick to question others without revealing much yourself. Why the insistence on asking about everyone else's role? Could you provide more details about your thoughts and actions during the night phase?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's persistent deflection and aggression without revealing his own role make him highly suspicious. It's important to press him to see if he slips up or provides valuable information that could help us identify if he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei:** Michael, you've been very aggressive in questioning others, which makes me suspicious. Why haven't you given us any information about your own role? What did you wake up as?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's consistent deflection and evasion make him highly suspicious. Pressuring him to reveal more could expose inconsistencies or push him to slip up, helping us identify if he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Michael:** Andrei, you keep deflecting questions and haven't given us much useful information. Are you trying to hide something? What was your real role during the night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been highly evasive and defensive throughout the discussion, repeatedly deflecting questions and refusing to reveal his role. This behavior is consistent with someone who might be hiding a Werewolf or Minion role. Therefore, I suspect Kraven most and will vote for him.
> **Michael [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Marius claimed to be a Mason, but I know for a fact that I am the only Mason. This means Marius is lying about his role, which makes him highly suspicious. He could either be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the real Werewolf. Voting for him seems like the best choice to identify and eliminate a potential threat.
> **Larisa [Mason]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's persistent deflection, aggressive questioning, and refusal to reveal his role make him highly suspicious. His behavior is consistent with that of a Werewolf or Minion trying to divert attention away from themselves. Voting for Michael seems like the best choice to potentially eliminate a key threat to the village team.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and eliminate potential threats. Michael has been very aggressive in questioning others without revealing his own role, which makes him appear suspicious to the group. By voting for Michael, I'm playing into the villagers' suspicions while also potentially eliminating a player who could be a threat to me (like the Seer or a Mason). Additionally, focusing on Michael helps keep suspicion off of me and maintains my cover as a supposed Mason. This vote aligns with my goal of subtly eliminating villagers without raising suspicion about my true role.
> **Marius [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael has consistently deflected questions and avoided revealing his own role throughout the day phase. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates that he may be trying to hide something. Additionally, his aggressive questioning of others without providing any useful information makes him the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf or Minion attempting to protect the Werewolves. Voting for Michael increases our chances of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


The votes were:
* Michael : Villager : 3
* Marius : Werewolf : 1
* Kraven : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The werewolves win.
