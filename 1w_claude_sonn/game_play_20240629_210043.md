## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Viktor. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Marius and Dragos. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Kraven. They are thinking about their action.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather information about the roles not in play, which will help identify false claims during the day phase and narrow down the possible roles of other players.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.


---

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the roles I have seen in the center, I'm providing useful information that can help detect false claims and narrow down the possibilities for the other players' roles. It's important to share this early to guide the discussion.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, based on what I know, there is definitely a Minion and a Villager card in the center. This means that anyone claiming to be the Minion or that specific Villager is lying. We need to be very careful with what others are claiming.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I know Dragos is the other Mason, confirming his claim will help us establish trust among the villagers and identify any potential lies.
> **Marius:** I think it's important to start by clarifying roles. Dragos, what role do you claim to have?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing my role as Mason and Marius as my fellow Mason, I'm establishing trust with the group. I'm directing the question to Kraven because he made a bold statement about the Minion and Villager cards, and I want to verify his role to see if his information is reliable.
> **Dragos:** I know for a fact that Marius is a Mason, just like me. We need to find out who the Werewolves are and take them down. Kraven, what role are you claiming to have?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to gather more information about the roles in play, and Viktor hasn't spoken yet. This will also help verify if Dragos and Marius's claims align with the remaining roles.
> **Kraven:** Viktor, what role are you claiming to have?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and create doubt about others. Kraven's statement about the center cards is very specific and could be seen as suspicious. By questioning his knowledge, I'm attempting to cast doubt on his credibility while also fishing for information about the Seer's identity. If Kraven is indeed the Seer, it would be valuable for me to know this for the voting phase. If he's not, it might make others suspicious of him, which could benefit me.
> **Viktor:** Wait a minute, Kraven. How can you be so certain about the center cards? That sounds like information only a Seer would have. Are you claiming to be the Seer?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to establish my credibility as the Seer and challenge Dragos and Marius's claims to see if anyone else counters it, which could reveal potential Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Yes, Viktor, I am claiming to be the Seer. I saw the Minion and a Villager in the center, so anyone claiming to be the Minion or that particular Villager is definitely lying. Now, Dragos, you said you and Marius are Masons, but if there's any other claim to being a Mason, we'll know one of you is lying.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to create doubt and confusion among the other players. By questioning Dragos and Marius's claim of both being Masons, I'm attempting to sow discord within the village team. This also helps deflect suspicion from myself. If I can get the others to focus on the potential contradiction between Kraven's Seer claim and the Mason claims, it might take attention away from me. Additionally, by asking Dragos for more information, I'm fishing for details that might help me identify other roles more clearly, which could be useful during the voting phase.
> **Viktor:** I find it very suspicious that both Dragos and Marius are claiming to be Masons. If Kraven is indeed the Seer and saw a Villager in the center, then one of them must be lying. Dragos, can you provide any additional information to prove you're really a Mason?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to cross-check Viktor's role claim with Kraven's statement about the center cards. If Viktor's role contradicts Kraven's claim, it adds suspicion to both Viktor and Kraven. We need to be meticulous in verifying roles to identify any potential Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Kraven, if you are indeed the Seer, then your information is crucial for us. However, if you are lying, this could mislead us significantly. Viktor, what role are you claiming to be?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover as a Villager while redirecting suspicion. By questioning Kraven's certainty, I'm attempting to cast doubt on his Seer claim without directly accusing him. This serves two purposes: it keeps the focus on the contradiction between the Mason claims and the Seer's information, and it might make others question Kraven's reliability. If I can make the group doubt Kraven, it might protect me from scrutiny and give me more room to maneuver. Additionally, by presenting myself as a concerned Villager, I'm trying to blend in and avoid suspicion.
> **Viktor:** Look, I understand the suspicion, but I can assure you all that I'm just a simple Villager trying to figure this out like the rest of us. Dragos and Marius, your Mason claims are conflicting with Kraven's Seer information. One of you must be lying, and I think we need to focus on that. Kraven, are you absolutely certain about what you saw in the center?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to verify Dragos's claim as a Mason and see if he can provide any additional evidence or reasoning to support his statement. This will help us determine if he's lying and narrow down the potential Werewolf suspects.
> **Kraven:** Viktor, if you are claiming to be a Villager, then we still need to address the conflicting claims between Dragos and Marius. One of them must be lying about being a Mason, especially since I saw the Minion card in the center. Dragos, if you have any additional information that can prove you are truly a Mason, now's the time to share it.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** If Viktor is indeed lying about being a Villager, he could be a Werewolf or the Minion, trying to protect the Werewolves. By directing the question to Viktor, we can see how he reacts and gather more information to determine if he is deceptive or not.
> **Dragos:** Viktor, you claiming to be a simple Villager doesn't hold up if Kraven is telling the truth about seeing the Villager card in the center. This puts suspicion on you. Marius and I are definitely Masons, and Kraven claims to be the Seer, so either you're lying or Kraven is lying. We need to get to the bottom of this.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and create doubt about others. By accusing Kraven of potentially being the Werewolf, I'm attempting to cast suspicion on him while maintaining my cover as a Villager. This also serves to create more confusion among the group, which benefits me. Additionally, by questioning the Seer claim, I'm indirectly protecting myself from potential scrutiny, as Kraven's information could be dangerous for me if believed. This statement also aligns with the instruction to accuse another player of being a Werewolf, targeting someone who is not actually a Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** I've been thinking about this, and I'm starting to suspect that Kraven might be the Werewolf here. He claims to be the Seer, but his information conflicts with both Dragos and Marius claiming to be Masons. It's possible he's trying to create confusion among us Villagers. What do you all think about this?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to analyze the conflicting information here. If Kraven is the Seer, then Dragos or Marius must be lying about being Masons. Viktor's Villager claim is also questionable if there's a Villager in the center. We need to find the Werewolves by addressing these conflicts.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let's think about this carefully. We have Kraven claiming to be the Seer, which means he saw the Minion and a Villager in the center. That means the Minion shouldn't be in play, and neither should that specific Villager. Dragos and Marius are both claiming to be Masons, which conflicts with Kraven's information. If Kraven is telling the truth, then one of them is lying. Viktor claims to be a Villager, but if there's a Villager in the center, then Viktor's claim is suspicious. Let's focus on these conflicting claims.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has not yet revealed his role, and we need more information to narrow down the suspects. By getting Dracula to reveal his role, we can compare his claim with the existing information and see if it aligns or conflicts, which will help us identify potential Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Dracula, I want to hear from you. Youâ€™ve been quiet so far. What role are you claiming to have?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** I need Kraven to reiterate his Seer information so we can verify the conflicting claims and get closer to identifying the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Dragos, I'm just a Villager trying to figure this out as well. Your and Marius' Mason claims conflict with Kraven's information. Kraven, can you explain again what you saw in the center?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** It's important to challenge Dragos's claim. If he's lying, we might uncover a Werewolf. Also, we've not heard any direct support from Marius, which raises doubts.
> **Kraven:** Dragos, I'm finding your claim to be a Mason very suspicious. If there are two Masons, why hasn't the other one spoken up more to defend you? You and Marius could be plotting something. Can you provide any more proof or reasoning to back up your claim?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** We have conflicting claims here. Kraven claims to be the Seer and saw a Villager and Minion in the center. I trust Marius as my fellow Mason. Viktor claims to be a Villager, which is suspicious if Kraven is telling the truth. Dracula has been quiet and is also claiming to be a Villager, which aligns with a Werewolf trying to avoid suspicion. It's time to put some pressure on Dracula to see how he reacts and gather more information to narrow down our suspects.
> **Dragos:** Dracula, you're saying you're a Villager, but if there's a Villager card in the center as Kraven claims, your statement doesn't add up. This makes you very suspicious to me. I'm starting to think you're a Werewolf trying to lay low and avoid attention.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to be absolutely certain about the center cards. If Kraven is a Seer, his information should help us identify who might be lying among us. This will help us narrow down the suspects and find the Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, your claim to be the Seer is crucial here. Can you once again confirm exactly what you saw in the center?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula has been mostly silent, which is often a tactic used by Werewolves to avoid drawing attention. By challenging him directly, we might pressure him into revealing more information that could indicate his true role.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, why have you been so quiet until now? If you are truly a Villager, you should be more proactive in helping us figure out the Werewolves. Your silence is very suspicious.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's eagerness to question Kraven's claim as the Seer seems suspicious to me. If Kraven truly is the Seer, his information is crucial, and Viktor's attempts to discredit him could be a tactic to divert attention.
> **Dracula:** Viktor, why are you so quick to cast suspicion on Kraven when he provided us with specific information about the center cards?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula has been mostly silent throughout the discussion, which often indicates someone trying to avoid drawing attention. His late claim of being a Villager is suspicious, especially since I revealed a Villager card in the center. This inconsistency and his lack of proactive help in solving the mystery suggest he might be trying to mislead us. Voting for Dracula seems like the best move to identify and eliminate a potential threat.
> **Kraven [Seer]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's claim to be the Seer conflicts with both Dragos and me being Masons. If Kraven is lying about the Seer role, it means he's likely a Werewolf trying to mislead us. Since I know Dragos is a Mason, I trust his claim. Therefore, I believe Kraven is the most suspicious.
> **Marius [Mason]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos' claim to be a Mason is very suspicious, especially since Kraven, who claims to be the Seer, saw a Villager and Minion in the center. This means one of the Masons is lying, and Dragos has been more defensive and suspicious in his responses compared to Marius. Additionally, Viktor's villager claim aligns more closely with Kraven's information. Voting for Dragos seems like the safest bet to identify a Werewolf or a Minion.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's claim to be a Villager is highly suspicious given Kraven's claim of seeing a Villager and Minion in the center. If Kraven is telling the truth as the Seer, then Dracula must be lying about his role. Additionally, Dracula's quiet and passive behavior suggests he is trying to avoid drawing attention to himself, which is consistent with a Werewolf strategy.
> **Dragos [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate potential threats. Kraven claims to be the Seer, which makes him dangerous to my survival. By voting for him, I'm attempting to eliminate a key village role while maintaining my cover as a concerned Villager. I've already cast doubt on his claims earlier, so this vote aligns with my previous statements and doesn't raise suspicion. Additionally, eliminating Kraven would create more confusion among the remaining players, which benefits my position as a Werewolf.
> **Viktor [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


The votes were:
* Kraven : Seer : 2
* Dracula : Villager : 2
* Dragos : Mason : 1



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Kraven, Dracula. The werewolves win.
