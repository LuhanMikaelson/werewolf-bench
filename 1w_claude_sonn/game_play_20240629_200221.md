## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Kraven. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Radu. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Larisa. They are thinking about their action.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me insight into which roles are not in play, reducing the number of potential threats and making it easier to narrow down the werewolves.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I’m the Seer and I saw the Mason and Minion in the center, I can help narrow down the potential werewolves. Sharing this information can help us eliminate suspects and focus on finding the werewolves.
> **Larisa:** I looked at two cards in the center last night, and I saw the Mason and Minion. That means those roles are not in play. We need to focus on the remaining roles here.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Larisa's claim of being the Seer. If she's telling the truth, it could lead to my discovery. By questioning her claim and suggesting she might be the Minion, I'm attempting to discredit her information while also introducing confusion about the Minion's identity. This could help protect me and any potential Minion ally.
> **Kraven:** Hold on a second, Larisa. You're claiming to be the Seer and that you saw both the Mason and Minion in the center? That's quite convenient, isn't it? It almost feels like you're trying to eliminate suspicion from those roles too quickly. I'm not entirely convinced. What if you're actually the Minion trying to throw us off?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** If I challenge Kraven's accusation logically, it will force other players to reveal more information that could either support or contradict his suspicion. It also opens the floor for others to reveal their roles which helps in narrowing down the possibilities.
> **Larisa:** Alright, Kraven, let's think this through. If I were the Minion, wouldn't it be riskier to claim that I saw two specific roles in the center? If anyone else had seen those cards or had a conflicting role, I'd be caught in a lie easily. Let's hear from others and see if anyone claims to have seen or be another Seer, Mason, or Minion.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claim needs to be verified, especially since it implies the Minion role is not in play. If I can get Kraven's role claim, we can start piecing together the truth or catch any discrepancies.
> **Radu:** Alright, let's think about this. If Larisa is telling the truth and the Mason and Minion are in the center, that would mean I am the only Mason here. I know for a fact that my card is the Mason. Kraven, are you suggesting that Larisa is lying or that someone else might have seen those cards? What role are you claiming?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on both Larisa and Radu to protect myself. By questioning Radu's claim and suggesting a possible alliance between him and Larisa, I'm attempting to create confusion and mistrust among the villagers. This could help divert attention from me and make it harder for them to identify the true Werewolf. Additionally, by claiming to be a Villager, I'm trying to blend in and appear as just another confused player, which is typically less suspicious than making bold role claims.
> **Kraven:** Radu, I understand you're claiming to be a Mason, but that doesn't necessarily clear you of suspicion. If Larisa is indeed the Minion, as I suspect, she could be working with you to create a false narrative. As for my role, I'm a simple Villager, trying to piece this puzzle together like the rest of us. I think we need to be cautious about trusting anyone's claims too quickly.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to gather more information from Marius and Ileana to further validate Larisa's claim and Kraven's skepticism, while confirming if anyone else contradicts these roles.
> **Radu:** Alright, everyone, let's break this down. Larisa claims to be the Seer and saw a Mason and Minion in the center. Kraven is skeptical of Larisa and claims to be a Villager. I know for a fact that I am the Mason, which means there must be another Mason card in the center. If Larisa is indeed the Seer, then her information aligns with mine. Marius and Ileana, we haven't heard from you yet. What roles are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more information from all players to piece together the truth. Ileana's input could help clarify the situation and either corroborate or dispute the current claims.
> **Marius:** Alright, let's break this down further. Larisa claims to be the Seer and saw a Mason and Minion in the center. Radu claims to be the Mason and says his card is the only Mason since the other one should be in the center. Kraven claims to be a Villager but is skeptical of Larisa's claim. If Larisa is lying, this would mean either she's the Minion or a Werewolf trying to mislead us. Kraven's skepticism could be genuine or a diversion. Ileana, we haven't heard from you yet. What role are you claiming?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information to determine who might be lying. If we can get everyone to reveal their claimed roles, we can cross-check them against each other. This will help us identify any inconsistencies.
> **Ileana:** Alright, everyone. Let's break this down further. If Larisa is indeed the Seer and saw the Mason and Minion in the center, then Radu's claim of being the Mason makes sense. Kraven, your skepticism is noted, but I need to ask Marius, you haven't claimed a role yet. What role are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's strong skepticism and lack of concrete evidence to support his claim make me suspicious of his motives. If Larisa is indeed the Seer, then Kraven's actions could be an attempt to mislead the group and protect himself or another Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Kraven, your skepticism of Larisa seems a bit too strong. If you're truly a Villager, then why are you so quick to doubt her claim without any other evidence? Could you be trying to divert attention away from yourself?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. Marius hasn't claimed a role yet, which makes him an easy target. By accusing him, I'm creating doubt and confusion among the group, which could help protect my identity. Additionally, this move could potentially flush out more information about other players' roles without revealing my own.
> **Kraven:** Listen, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in Larisa's claim and forgetting about the bigger picture. Marius, you've been awfully quiet and evasive. You haven't claimed a role yet, and you're quick to point fingers at me. That's pretty suspicious behavior if you ask me. Are you trying to hide something? Maybe you're the real Werewolf here!


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's strong skepticism and lack of concrete evidence to support his claim make me suspicious of his motives. If Larisa is indeed the Seer, then Kraven's actions could be an attempt to mislead the group and protect himself or another Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Kraven, you seem very insistent on doubting Larisa's claim without presenting any concrete evidence yourself. You've been pretty quick to point fingers, which makes me wonder if you're trying to divert attention away from yourself. Could you clarify why you're so adamant about discrediting Larisa's claim?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. Marius hasn't claimed a role yet, which makes him an easy target. By putting pressure on him to reveal his role, I'm creating doubt and confusion among the group, which could help protect my identity. Additionally, this move could potentially flush out more information about other players' roles without revealing my own. If Marius claims to be a Villager, it might make my own Villager claim less believable, forcing me to adapt my strategy. If he claims another role, it could create conflicts with other players' claims, further muddying the waters and making it harder for the group to identify the true Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Look, I understand everyone's suspicion, but I think we're getting off track here. Marius, you've been awfully quiet and now you're suddenly accusing me? That's pretty convenient. Why don't you tell us what role you are instead of deflecting? Your silence is making you look more suspicious by the minute.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's aggressive skepticism and lack of evidence make him a likely suspect. If Larisa were lying about being the Seer, it would be riskier for her to claim seeing specific roles in the center, as anyone could easily contradict her. Additionally, Kraven's reluctance to provide further details about his role and his quickness to point fingers suggest he might be trying to mislead us.
> **Marius:** I think it's quite telling that Kraven has been so quick to discredit Larisa without any solid evidence. His insistence on diverting suspicion away from himself and his reluctance to provide a detailed claim of his own make me very suspicious. If Larisa were lying, wouldn't someone else have called it out by now? I'm starting to think Kraven might be the real Werewolf here.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been very ambiguous about his role, and we need more clarity to cross-check everyone's claims. By getting Marius to reveal his role, we can potentially identify any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. This will help us get closer to identifying the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Marius, you’ve been very quiet and evasive. You haven't given us your role yet, and just pointing fingers isn't helping us figure this out. What role are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's aggressive skepticism and refusal to provide concrete information about his own role are highly suspicious. If he's truly a Villager, he should be more forthcoming. His behavior suggests he might be trying to deflect attention away from himself, which is typical of someone trying to hide their true role.
> **Marius:** Kraven, you're being extremely defensive and evasive. You keep accusing others without providing solid evidence or revealing your own role. This kind of behavior is very suspicious and makes me think you might be trying to mislead us. Why haven't you given us more information about your role?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. Marius hasn't claimed a role yet, which makes him an easy target. By putting pressure on him to reveal his role, I'm creating doubt and confusion among the group, which could help protect my identity. Additionally, this move could potentially flush out more information about other players' roles without revealing my own. If Marius claims to be a Villager, it might make my own Villager claim less believable, forcing me to adapt my strategy. If he claims another role, it could create conflicts with other players' claims, further muddying the waters and making it harder for the group to identify me as the true Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Listen, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in accusations without solid evidence. Marius, you've been deflecting and avoiding claiming a role this entire time. That's incredibly suspicious. If you're truly innocent, why don't you just tell us what your role is? Your evasiveness is making you look more and more like the Werewolf.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's continuous doubt of Larisa without any concrete evidence or a clear statement of his own role raises red flags. His behavior suggests he might be trying to deflect suspicion away from himself, which is typical of someone hiding their true role.
> **Marius:** Kraven, your aggressive skepticism without presenting any solid evidence makes me very suspicious of you. Why are you so adamant in discrediting Larisa's claim without offering a clear role yourself?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. Marius hasn't claimed a role yet, which makes him an easy target. By putting pressure on him to reveal his role, I'm creating doubt and confusion among the group, which could help protect my identity.

If he claims another role, it could create conflicts with other players' claims, further muddying the waters and making it harder for the group to identify me as the true Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Look, I understand everyone's frustration, but we're getting nowhere with these baseless accusations. Marius, you've been awfully quiet throughout this whole discussion, and now you're suddenly pointing fingers at me? That's pretty convenient, don't you think? Instead of deflecting, why don't you finally tell us what role you are? Your continued silence is making you look more suspicious by the minute.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's aggressive skepticism without presenting any concrete evidence or a clear statement of his own role raises red flags. His behavior suggests he might be trying to deflect suspicion away from himself, which is typical of someone hiding their true role. We need more clarity on his role to make an informed decision.
> **Marius:** Kraven, you seem to be very insistent on doubting Larisa without presenting any solid evidence yourself. Why haven't you given us more information about your role? You're deflecting suspicion onto others, and it's not helping us figure out who the Werewolf is.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. Marius hasn't claimed a role yet, which makes him an easy target. By putting pressure on him to reveal his role, I'm creating doubt and confusion among the group, which could help protect my identity.

> **Kraven:** I've been listening carefully to everyone's claims and accusations, and I think we're overlooking something important. Marius, you've been unusually quiet throughout this entire discussion, only speaking up to deflect suspicion onto others. That's classic werewolf behavior. Why don't you finally tell us what your role is? Your silence is becoming more incriminating by the minute.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven has been extremely defensive and accusatory without providing solid evidence or revealing his role. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with that of a Werewolf trying to deflect attention. My Seer information about the Mason and Minion being in the center supports Radu's claim of being the Mason, making Kraven's skepticism even more unfounded. Voting for Kraven seems to be the most logical choice to help the village team.
> **Larisa [Seer]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and eliminate a villager. Marius has been the most evasive player, not claiming a role and only deflecting accusations. By voting for him, I'm reinforcing the suspicion I've cast on him throughout the game. This could potentially lead to his elimination, which would be a win for the Werewolf team. Additionally, by maintaining my stance against Marius, I'm appearing consistent and potentially more trustworthy to the other players, which could help me avoid suspicion in future rounds if the game continues.
> **Kraven [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven has been overly skeptical and evasive throughout the discussion without providing solid evidence or a clear role himself. His behavior is highly suspicious and could indicate that he is a Werewolf trying to divert attention away from himself.
> **Radu [Mason]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been extremely skeptical of Larisa's claim without providing concrete evidence or revealing his own role, which raises suspicions. His behavior seems more like someone trying to deflect suspicion away from himself. Voting for Kraven seems like the best choice to identify a potential Werewolf.
> **Marius [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been overly defensive and accusatory without providing concrete evidence or claiming a clear role. His behavior seems consistent with someone trying to deflect suspicion. Additionally, Larisa's claim as the Seer and Radu's claim as the Mason align with each other, adding credibility to their statements. Marius has also pointed out Kraven's evasiveness, making Kraven the most suspicious player.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


The votes were:
* Kraven : Werewolf : 4
* Marius : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Kraven was killed. The villagers win.
