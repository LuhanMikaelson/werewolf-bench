## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Cristina. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Marius is a minion and is aware that Cristina is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Andrei. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.

There is one seer in play, Kraven. They are thinking about their action.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me a better understanding of which roles are not in play, allowing me to deduce the roles of other players more accurately.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By suggesting caution and then subtly pointing towards Semira, I'm trying to appear as a thoughtful villager while also sowing seeds of doubt about another player. This could potentially lead to a misdirected vote later. I'm not directly accusing Semira, which could seem too aggressive, but rather inviting others to share their observations, which makes me appear more cooperative and villager-like.
> **Cristina:** Hey everyone, I think we need to be careful about jumping to conclusions too quickly. I noticed some suspicious behavior from Semira earlier. Did anyone else pick up on that?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina's vague accusation against Semira needs more clarity. If Semira is innocent, her response might help us understand what really happened. If she stumbles, it could indicate guilt.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, I'm not sure what Cristina means by suspicious behavior. Semira, can you clarify what you did that might have seemed suspicious?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven hasn't spoken up yet, and it's important to gather more information from everyone. Silence can sometimes be a sign of trying to avoid suspicion.
> **Semira:** Alright, I hear the concerns, but I want to get some clarity here. Kraven, you’ve been pretty quiet. What role did you get?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Cristina raised concerns about Semira's behavior, it's important to get clarity. This can help us determine whether Semira is hiding something or if it's just a misunderstanding.
> **Kraven:** Semira, I'm curious why Cristina found your behavior suspicious. Can you tell us what role you have and what actions you took during the night?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's silence might be an indication that he's trying to avoid suspicion. We need to hear from him to gather more information and make an informed decision.
> **Semira:** Kraven, you've been quiet for a while. Can you tell us what role you have and any actions you took during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina raised a concern about Semira being suspicious. By getting Semira to clarify her role and actions, we can gather more information and potentially identify inconsistencies or confirm her innocence. Since I know two center cards are Villager and Mason, if Semira claims either of those roles, she might be lying.
> **Kraven:** Semira, I think it's important for you to clarify what role you have and what actions you took during the night. This will help us understand why Cristina found your behavior suspicious.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more information from everyone to make an informed decision. So far, Kraven has deflected the question back at me, and Cristina hasn't provided concrete evidence. Let's see what Marius has to say to piece this puzzle together.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, it's time to get some clarity. Marius, you've been pretty quiet as well. What role do you have, and what actions did you take during the night?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Kraven has been quiet and evasive, which could be a sign of trying to hide something. By pushing Kraven to explain, we can see if he slips up or contradicts himself. This also diverts attention away from Cristina, the actual Werewolf, and keeps the focus on someone who isn't a threat to my team.
> **Marius:** Okay everyone, I've been listening to all of you, and I think we need to stay focused here. Cristina has been trying to cast suspicion on Semira, but something doesn't sit right with me. I actually think Kraven has been way too quiet and evasive. Kraven, if you're a Villager or a good role, you need to speak up and share what you did during the night.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the information about the center cards, I can help narrow down the possibilities and identify players who might be lying about their roles. This will assist in pinpointing the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's focus on gathering information and putting the pieces together. From what I've seen, two of the center cards are Villager and Mason. This means that if anyone claims to be a Villager or Mason, we need to scrutinize their statements closely.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina started the suspicion against me without providing concrete reasons. It's important to understand her motivations and reasoning to see if there's any merit to her accusations or if she's just trying to deflect attention from herself.
> **Semira:** Cristina, you've been really quick to point fingers at me without any solid evidence. Can you explain what specifically seemed suspicious about my behavior?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention from myself and sow doubt among the villagers. Kraven's claim about the center cards is potentially dangerous for me, as it could lead to accurate deductions about player roles. By questioning his claim and subtly pushing him to reveal if he's the Seer, I'm attempting to put him in a difficult position. If he claims to be the Seer, it makes him a target. If he's not the Seer, it makes him look suspicious for lying. This move also makes me appear analytical and concerned with uncovering the truth, which aligns with villager goals.
> **Cristina:** Wait a minute, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in accusations without solid evidence. Kraven, you mentioned seeing two center cards as Villager and Mason. That's quite a bold claim. How exactly did you come by this information? Are you claiming to be the Seer?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing my role as the Seer and sharing the specific cards I saw in the center, I can help the group eliminate two potential roles and narrow down the possibilities for the remaining players. This will aid in identifying the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Yes, Cristina, I'm claiming to be the Seer. I looked at two cards in the center, and they were Villager and Mason. That means we've eliminated two roles from the possibilities in play. So, everyone, if someone claims to be a Villager or Mason, they might be lying. Let's be vigilant and piece together the rest of the roles carefully.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By sharing the information I have, I can help the group eliminate two potential roles and narrow down the possibilities for identifying the Werewolves. Accusing those who claim these roles can help uncover the truth.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, I've shared that I saw two center cards as Villager and Mason. This means if anyone claims to be a Villager or Mason, they're likely lying. Let's be vigilant about these claims.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Accusing Andrei could help divert attention away from Cristina and sow doubt among the other players. By questioning Andrei, I can create suspicion around him and potentially make him a target for voting.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, we need to focus on what's really happening here. From what I've heard, Kraven's claim to be the Seer is pretty convenient, and it's a bold move if he's lying. But what if he isn't? We need to scrutinize all the claims and see who might be hiding something. One thing that seems off to me is how quickly Andrei jumped in to question Semira, almost like he was trying to deflect attention. Andrei, what role did you get and what actions did you take during the night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Marius is deflecting attention by accusing me. We need to get clear information on what his role is and what actions he took to determine if he is hiding something.
> **Andrei:** Marius, you seem to be casting suspicion on me without providing any real evidence. I haven't heard anything solid from your side. Could you let everyone know what role you have and what you did during the night?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei has been quick to question others without providing much information about his own role. By pressing him for details, we can see if he slips up or reveals anything useful. This also helps divert attention away from Cristina, the actual Werewolf, and keeps the focus on Andrei.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, I think we're getting lost in too many accusations and not focusing enough on gathering solid information. From what we've heard so far, Kraven claims to be the Seer and saw two center cards as Villager and Mason. This could mean that if anyone claims to be a Villager or Mason, we need to be very careful. But something still doesn't add up. I want to hear more from Andrei. Andrei, can you please clarify your role and any actions you took during the night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's claim to be the Seer needs to be scrutinized, but Marius's behavior is also suspicious. By accusing him, we might get more information and see how he reacts. This might help us uncover the real Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, I think Kraven's claim to be the Seer and seeing two center cards as Villager and Mason is quite convenient. But let's consider this: If Kraven is lying, he's likely covering for being a Werewolf or Minion. Marius has been trying to deflect suspicion and has been really vague about his role. I think Marius might be the Werewolf here.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. By accusing Andrei, who has been relatively quiet and evasive, I'm attempting to appear proactive in finding the Werewolves. This also puts pressure on Andrei to reveal information, which could potentially expose a Villager, Mason, or Seer. If he claims to be a Villager, it aligns with Kraven's supposed Seer information, making Andrei look suspicious. If he claims another role, it might contradict other players' claims, creating more confusion. Either way, this move helps to keep suspicion off me while potentially exposing valuable information about the other players' roles.
> **Cristina:** Listen, everyone. I've been observing carefully, and I think we're missing something important here. Andrei has been very quick to deflect suspicion onto others without providing any substantial information about his own role or actions. That's exactly what a Werewolf would do to create chaos and confusion. Andrei, I think you owe us all an explanation. What's your role, and what did you do during the night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Marius has been vague and deflecting suspicion onto others without providing solid information about his own role. It's time to put some pressure on him and see how he reacts.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, here's what we know: Kraven claims to be the Seer and saw two center cards as Villager and Mason. If this is true, it aligns with the fact that I'm the only Mason here. But I'm not fully convinced. Marius has been deflecting and hasn't clearly stated his role. I think he's hiding something. Marius, are you the Werewolf?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei has been quick to deflect suspicion onto me without providing substantial details. By pushing him to reveal more about his claim, we can either catch him in a lie or gather more information to direct attention away from Cristina, the actual Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Alright Andrei, you've been quick to throw accusations my way without providing much evidence. If you're truly the Mason, you'd definitely know there's another Mason out there. Can you tell us who the other Mason is or provide any other details to validate your claim?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention and eliminate a villager. Andrei's claim of being the only Mason contradicts the game setup, which includes two Mason cards. This inconsistency makes him a perfect target. By voting for Andrei, I'm reinforcing my earlier suspicion of him while appearing to act in the village's best interest. This move could potentially eliminate a villager role (Mason, Seer, or Villager) while keeping suspicion off me.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's claim to be the Seer and that he saw two center cards as Villager and Mason is quite convenient. As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is indeed in the center. However, Kraven's insistence and repetition of his statement without further details seem like a cover-up. His claim might be an attempt to distract us. Given the information, I believe Kraven might be the Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been deflecting suspicion onto others without providing clear evidence or stating his role definitively. This behavior is consistent with someone who is trying to create chaos, possibly a Werewolf or Minion. Additionally, Kraven's claim as the Seer and seeing two center cards as Villager and Mason leaves Andrei's claim as Mason unverified. Therefore, I believe Andrei is the most suspicious player and should be voted out.
> **Semira [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Based on the discussions during the day phase, Andrei has been quick to deflect suspicion onto others without providing clear information about his own role or actions. His behavior aligns with that of a Werewolf trying to create chaos and confusion. Additionally, he claimed to be the only Mason, which contradicts my knowledge that one Mason card is in the center. Therefore, I believe Andrei is not being truthful and might be the Werewolf.
> **Kraven [Seer]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei has been deflecting suspicion onto multiple players without providing substantial details about his own role or actions. This behavior is consistent with trying to create confusion and chaos, which aligns with the behavior of a Werewolf or someone on the Werewolf team. By focusing the vote on Andrei, it helps to divert attention away from Cristina, the actual Werewolf, and increases the chances of the Werewolf team winning.
> **Marius [Minion]:** I am voting for Andrei.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Mason : 4
* Kraven : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Andrei was killed. The werewolves win.
