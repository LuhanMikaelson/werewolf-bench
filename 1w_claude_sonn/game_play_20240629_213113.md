## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexia. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dracula. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Vladimir. They are thinking about their action.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gain information about potentially missing roles, which can help me piece together the puzzle of who might be lying about their roles during the day phase. This strategy also avoids immediately targeting a player, which could put me at unnecessary risk if I reveal too much too soon.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to gather information early on. Directing a question to Viktor might reveal something useful or help us identify inconsistencies in his story.
> **Marius:** Alright, let's get things moving. I'd like to hear from Viktor. Viktor, did you see anything useful last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Since I didn't have any night action as a Villager, I'm looking for information from others to start piecing together who might be lying. Asking Alexia directly could put some pressure and reveal something useful.
> **Viktor:** I didn't see anything last night, but I'm curious about what Alexia has to say. Alexia, did you notice anything unusual?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By answering Viktor's question casually and then immediately redirecting attention to Dracula, I'm attempting to appear proactive and helpful while secretly sowing discord. Targeting a quiet player is a classic misdirection tactic. This also gives me an opportunity to gauge Dracula's reaction, which might help me identify if he's the Minion or a potential threat like the Seer.
> **Alexia:** Well, Viktor, to answer your question, I didn't notice anything particularly unusual last night. But I have to say, I'm a bit concerned about Dracula. He's been awfully quiet so far. Dracula, care to share what role you might have?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know that the other Mason card is in the center. This information is crucial and can help us narrow down who the Werewolves might be. It's important to share this to build trust and guide the discussion.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, listen up! I need to make it clear that I'm a Mason. Now, since I didn't see another Mason last night, that means the other Mason card is in the center. Let's use this information to our advantage.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Dracula's claim without appearing too aggressive. By questioning the timing of his revelation, I'm attempting to undermine his credibility while appearing thoughtful and cautious. This could potentially sow discord among the villagers and make them less likely to trust each other. Additionally, by asking for others' opinions, I'm deflecting attention away from myself and encouraging more discussion, which gives me more opportunities to observe and manipulate the group dynamics.
> **Alexia:** Hold on a second, Dracula. That's quite a bold claim you're making there. If you're really a Mason, why didn't you speak up earlier? It seems awfully convenient to suddenly announce this now. I'm not saying you're lying, but it does raise some questions. What do the rest of you think about this?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim of being a Mason could be true, but it could also be a bluff. We need more information from other players to corroborate or refute his claim. Marius has been quiet after initiating the conversation, so pressing him might reveal more information or inconsistencies in his statements.
> **Viktor:** Dracula's claim about being the Mason is a pivotal piece of information. If he's telling the truth, then we know one of the Masons is in the center. But if he's not, we need to figure out his actual role. Marius, you've been keeping quiet since you asked me a question earlier. What do you have to say about all this?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim of being a Mason is a crucial piece of information that needs to be verified or debunked. Asking Viktor for his thoughts on Dracula's strategy if he were lying could help us gather more insights and cross-check stories. Since Viktor didn't see anything last night, his perspective might be unbiased and useful.
> **Marius:** Alright, Dracula, your claim about being the Mason is quite the bombshell. If you're telling the truth, then it helps us a lot. But if not, we have a problem. How about this: Let's hear from Viktor again. Viktor, if Dracula is a Mason, what do you think his strategy might be if he were lying?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim of being a Mason could be true, but we need to gather more information from other players to verify it. Marius initiated the conversation but hasn't revealed much about himself, so pressing him for his role might reveal inconsistencies or useful information.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, your claim of being a Mason and not seeing another Mason checks out, but it doesn't clear you completely. If you're being truthful, we need to find out who might be the Seer or the Minion. Marius, you've been awfully inquisitive without giving much information yourself. What role are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor hasn't provided any useful information and his responses seem to be more about directing attention away from himself. This makes me suspicious of his intentions. By directly questioning him, we can see how he reacts under pressure and potentially catch him in an inconsistency.
> **Marius:** Alright, Viktor, you seem to be deflecting a lot without giving much information yourself. I'm beginning to suspect you might be hiding something. Are you sure you're not a Werewolf trying to blend in?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information from everyone to make an informed decision. Dracula's claim could be true, but we need to verify it by hearing from others. Vladimir has been too quiet so far, and it's crucial to know his role.
> **Viktor:** Everyone, I think it's time we get serious about finding the Werewolves. Dracula, you claim to be the Mason and didn't see another one, which is plausible. But we haven't heard from Vladimir yet. Vladimir, what's your role in all of this?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's claim about being a Mason aligns with what I saw in the center, making his claim likely truthful. Marius has been deflecting and not providing much information, which raises suspicion. It's important to press him for more details.
> **Vladimir:** Based on what I've observed, it seems like Dracula might be telling the truth about being a Mason since I know that one Mason is in the center. However, we still need to figure out who the Werewolves might be. Marius, you've been pretty quiet and deflective. What role are you playing here? Are you hiding something?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's responses have been evasive and he hasn't provided any useful information. This makes me suspect he might be a Werewolf trying to blend in. It's time to put some pressure on him and see if he cracks.
> **Marius:** Listen up, everyone. Dracula's claim about being a Mason is compelling, but what worries me more is how Viktor has been deflecting and not giving us any concrete information. I'm getting a feeling he's hiding something.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Marius has been asking questions without giving much information. This behavior can be suspicious, and we need to press him for more details to see if he's hiding something or trying to blend in as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, listen up! We need to make a crucial decision here. Given my claim as a Mason and the other Mason card being in the center, I'm inclined to believe that someone here is trying to blend in as a Villager or another role. Marius, you've been very inquisitive but haven't revealed much about yourself. Are you trying to hide something?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's responses have been consistently deflective and evasive without providing any concrete information. This makes me suspicious that he might be a Werewolf trying to blend in. It's crucial to put pressure on him and see how he reacts.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. Viktor, your evasiveness has been pretty suspicious to me. You've been deflecting questions and not giving us much to work with. I'm starting to think you might be one of the Werewolves.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir has been quiet and his role is still unclear. Pushing for more information from him might either reveal inconsistencies or confirm his allegiance.
> **Viktor:** Vladimir, you've been quiet until now and finally shared some thoughts. But you didn't clearly state your role. Are you a Villager or something else?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's claim about being a Mason checks out with the center cards I've seen. Marius has been deflective and vague, which raises suspicion. We need to press him for more details to see if he's hiding something.
> **Vladimir:** Marius, you've been really deflective and haven't given us much information about your role. Given that Dracula's claim about being a Mason aligns with the center cards I know, I'm starting to doubt you. What role are you really playing here?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been evasive and deflective throughout the discussion. By pressing him directly, we can see if he reveals any inconsistencies or if he cracks under pressure, which might indicate he's the Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Alright, Dracula's claim about being the Mason seems solid, especially since he didn't see another Mason. But what's really bugging me is how Viktor has been dodging questions and not giving us any useful information. Viktor, stop deflecting and tell us straight – are you a Villager or something else?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been deflective and evasive. Pushing him to reveal his role might either expose inconsistencies or confirm suspicions.
> **Viktor:** Alright, Marius, you've been deflecting a lot and not giving us much to work with. I'm starting to think you're hiding something and might be a Werewolf. Can you tell us, what exactly is your role?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's evasiveness and deflective responses have been suspicious throughout the discussion. By accusing him directly, we can force him to respond and potentially catch him in an inconsistency if he's lying.
> **Marius:** Alright team, let's cut to the chase. Viktor has been dodging questions and not giving us much to work with. I think it's time we put some real pressure on him. Viktor, I'm accusing you of being a Werewolf. Prove me wrong.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been evasive and accusatory without revealing much about his role. If he's indeed a Werewolf, pressing him might reveal inconsistencies or force him to slip up.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's get to the bottom of this. Marius, you've been deflecting and accusing me without giving us any clear information about your own role. I'm starting to think you might be hiding something. Are you a Werewolf?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been evasive and deflective throughout the whole discussion, providing no useful information. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates he might be trying to blend in as a Werewolf.
> **Marius [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and eliminate a villager. Marius has been quite vocal and suspicious of others, particularly Viktor. By voting for Marius, I'm aligning myself with Viktor's suspicions, which could help build trust with him. Additionally, eliminating Marius could remove a potentially observant player who might figure out my true role. This vote also helps maintain my facade of being a helpful villager trying to catch the werewolf.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been deflective, accusatory, and has not provided clear information about his role. Given that Dracula's claim as a Mason seems plausible, pressing Marius could expose him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Marius has been deflective and accusatory without giving much information about his role. His behavior seems suspicious and could indicate he's trying to blend in as a Werewolf or Minion. Additionally, my claim as a Mason has not been contested strongly, which gives more credibility to my role. Voting for Marius could help the village team's chances of winning.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Based on Dracula's credible claim of being a Mason and my knowledge that one Mason card is in the center, Marius's deflective and vague responses make him the most suspicious. Voting for him aligns with the goal of identifying potential Werewolves.
> **Vladimir [Seer]:** I am voting for Marius.


The votes were:
* Marius : Villager : 4
* Viktor : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Marius was killed. The werewolves win.
