## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center, so I'm looking for the Seer to verify their information and collaborate to find the Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's get this started. Who here wants to claim Seer? If we have a Seer, they should come forward and share what they saw. That could help us narrow things down quickly.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By suggesting we all share information, I appear cooperative. Claiming to be a Villager is a safe bet, as it's a common role. I'm also trying to discourage the real Seer from revealing themselves, which could be dangerous for me. This approach allows me to gauge other players' reactions and potentially identify the Seer or other important roles without revealing my true identity.
> **Andrei:** I don't think we should be too quick to have the Seer reveal themselves. The Werewolves could easily target them if we do. Instead, why don't we all share what roles we have and what we saw during the night? I'll start - I'm a Villager, so I didn't see anything.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Selene initially asked for the Seer to reveal themselves, it makes sense to inquire about her role. This helps us gather more information and potentially identify inconsistencies in the claims.
> **Kraven:** Alright, let's take Andrei's lead and start sharing our roles. I'm also a Villager, so I didn't see anything during the night. Selene, what role did you have?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to hear from the remaining players before making any accusations. Gathering as much information as possible early on is crucial to forming a coherent strategy. Plus, the more roles that are claimed, the easier it will be to spot inconsistencies or lies.
> **Selene:** Andrei and Kraven, both of you claimed to be Villagers. That's interesting, considering there are three Villagers total in the game. Mircea and Dracula, what roles are you claiming?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to hear from everyone to get a full picture of the roles in play. Since Andrei and Kraven both claimed to be Villagers, it is crucial to know what role you are claiming to help us identify any inconsistencies.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, you haven't shared your role yet. What role are you claiming?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has not yet revealed her role, which is important information for us to have. By asking her directly, we might get some clues on whether she's being truthful or not based on her response and demeanor.
> **Dracula:** Okay, so Andrei and Kraven both claim to be Villagers. Selene, you haven't revealed your role yet. What role are you claiming?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to know Selene's role since she initiated the questioning and has been directing the conversation. Her role might give us more clarity or reveal potential inconsistencies.
> **Dracula:** Selene, you still haven't revealed your role. What are you claiming?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been deflecting and not sharing his role, which is suspicious behavior. We need to get everyone on the table to make accurate deductions.
> **Selene:** Dracula, it seems like you're trying to avoid sharing your role. Are you hiding something? I think it's time for you to come clean. What role are you claiming?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been directing the conversation and pushing for information without giving any herself. Knowing her role could provide clarity or reveal inconsistencies.
> **Dracula:** Selene, it's interesting that you're pushing so much for me to reveal my role when you still haven't revealed yours. What are you claiming?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been deflecting and pushing for others to reveal without revealing his own role. This deflection is typical of someone who might be hiding something, like being a Werewolf or Minion. We need clarity to make an informed decision.
> **Selene:** Dracula, your reluctance to reveal your role is making me suspicious. If you really have nothing to hide, you should come clean. What role are you claiming?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's early suggestion to keep the Seer's identity hidden feels suspicious. If he's a Villager, he should want the Seer to reveal useful information. This line of questioning might get him to slip up if he's not being truthful.
> **Dracula:** Andrei, you claimed to be a Villager right from the start. Why were you so quick to suggest that the Seer shouldn't reveal themselves? It almost feels like you're trying to protect the Werewolves by keeping the Seer's information hidden.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Dracula's accusation, I'm attempting to deflect suspicion away from myself while simultaneously casting doubt on both Dracula and Selene. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear more innocent and cooperative, it creates tension between other players, and it subtly encourages them to reveal their roles without me having to directly ask. By suggesting that one of them might be a Werewolf, I'm also setting up potential targets for the vote later, which could help protect me.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, I understand your suspicion, but I think you're misinterpreting my intentions. I suggested not revealing the Seer immediately because it's a common strategy to protect them from being targeted. As for being quick to claim Villager, it's simply because that's what I am. Now, I'm more concerned about why you and Selene have been dancing around revealing your roles. It's making me wonder if one of you might be a Werewolf trying to hide. Care to explain your reluctance?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** By addressing the situation overall and pointing out Selene's behavior, I'm aiming to put her on the spot and see how she reacts. Her response might reveal whether she's being honest or if she's hiding something. If she's a Werewolf or Minion, her reluctance to reveal her role could be a clue.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. We've got two players, Andrei and Kraven, claiming to be Villagers, which checks out since we have three Villagers in total. But Selene, you still haven't revealed your role, and you're pushing pretty hard for others to come clean without doing so yourself. That seems fishy to me.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven and Andrei both claimed to be Villagers, which lines up with the number of Villagers in the game. Dracula has been deflecting, but Mircea hasn't shared their role at all. We need to know where everyone stands to make an informed decision.
> **Selene:** Mircea, you still haven't told us your role. It's important that everyone reveals their role so we can figure out who the Werewolves are. What role are you claiming?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** We need transparency to identify any inconsistencies. Since you've been pushing others to reveal their roles, it's only fair that you do the same. This will help us figure out if you're hiding something or if you're genuinely trying to help the village.
> **Mircea:** Selene, you've been quite adamant about everyone revealing their roles, yet you're the last one who hasn't shared. What role are you claiming?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea has been quiet and hasn't revealed their role, which is crucial information for us to piece together the puzzle. We need to know where everyone stands to identify the Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Mircea, it's very suspicious that you haven't shared your role yet. Andrei and Kraven have both claimed to be Villagers, and Dracula has been deflecting. By process of elimination, you should share your role now. What are you claiming?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's insistence on others revealing their roles while avoiding revealing her own is highly suspicious. Her deflection makes it seem like she might be hiding something, possibly being a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Mircea:** Selene, you're very eager to have everyone reveal their roles, yet you haven't shared yours. What are you hiding? What role are you claiming?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** To progress, we need everyone to reveal their roles. Mircea's silence is suspicious and we need to know where they stand to piece together the information we have.
> **Selene:** Alright, it's time for some clarity, everyone. I'm a Mason, and I know the other Mason card is in the center. That means there are no other Masons among us. We need to start narrowing this down. Mircea, you've been very quiet and dodging questions. What role are you claiming?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's claim as a Mason could be trusted since no one has contradicted it, and we need to focus on those who have been less forthcoming. Dracula's behavior has been suspicious, and we need to get to the bottom of it to identify potential Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** Alright, let me make things clear. I'm a Villager. Now that Selene has claimed to be a Mason and knows the other Mason card is in the center, we should focus on those who haven't been as transparent. Dracula, you've been dodging questions and deflecting. Why have you been avoiding sharing your role?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's early and quick Villager claim feels off to me. Coupled with the fact that he hasn't offered any useful information or asked any probing questions, it makes me suspicious. If he’s a Werewolf, it’s a classic strategy to blend in by claiming a harmless role right away.
> **Dracula:** Given everything we've heard, I think Kraven might be a Werewolf. He's been too quick to claim Villager without much thought, and it's possible he's trying to hide in plain sight.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been deflecting and avoiding sharing his role throughout the entire discussion. This behavior is typical of someone trying to hide something, such as being a Werewolf or Minion. By voting for Dracula, we have a higher chance of eliminating a potential threat to the village team.
> **Selene [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention from myself and eliminate potential threats. Selene claiming to be a Mason is dangerous, as Masons are typically trusted villagers. By voting for her, I'm attempting to cast doubt on her claim and potentially eliminate a village-aligned player. Additionally, her late role reveal and aggressive questioning of others could be seen as suspicious by other players, making my vote seem more justified and less likely to raise suspicion about my own role.
> **Andrei [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been consistently deflecting and avoiding revealing his role, which raises suspicion. Selene claimed to be a Mason and confirmed that the other Mason card is in the center. Andrei and Mircea claimed to be Villagers, which leaves Dracula as the most suspicious. It's possible that Dracula is either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been evasive and deflecting questions throughout the discussion, which is suspicious behavior. Additionally, Selene's claim as a Mason adds some credibility, and Andrei and Kraven's claims to be Villagers could be true since there are three Villager cards. Voting for Dracula seems like the best move to identify a possible Werewolf.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's quick claim to be a Villager without offering much information or engaging in the conversation raises suspicion. Coupled with the fact that Selene asserted being a Mason and confirmed the other Mason card is in the center, Kraven's behavior appears to be that of someone trying to hide in plain sight. This makes me believe he could potentially be a Werewolf.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


The votes were:
* Selene : Mason : 1
* Kraven : Villager : 1
* Dracula : Villager : 3



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
