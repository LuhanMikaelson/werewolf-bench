## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Dragos. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Semira is a minion and is aware that Dragos is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Selene. They are thinking about their action.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards reduces the uncertainty about the roles in play. Since there are only three center cards, this will provide a clearer picture of what roles might be among the players. This can help identify any false claims during the Day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather information about any potential role changes or insights into the center cards to start piecing together who might be the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Hey everyone, did anyone see any interesting cards in the center or did anyone swap roles during the night?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the center cards I saw, I'm providing crucial information to narrow down the possible roles in play. This will help us identify any false claims and find the Werewolf.
> **Selene:** I looked at two cards in the center, and they were a Mason and a Villager. This means that there is only one Mason among us, and we might have a Werewolf in our midst.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Selene's claim without being too obvious. By questioning her certainty, I'm subtly implying she might be lying or mistaken, which could make others suspicious of her. At the same time, I'm showing concern for the village to appear as a loyal Villager myself. This approach allows me to potentially discredit the Seer while maintaining my cover.
> **Dragos:** Selene, I find your claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center quite interesting. Are you absolutely certain about that? Because if you're the Seer, that would mean there's definitely a Werewolf among us, which is quite concerning. I'm starting to worry about our village's safety.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Larisa initiated the discussion, and her role or actions during the night could provide valuable information to confirm or refute my findings. Understanding her role can help us narrow down the possibilities of who might be the Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Larisa, you asked if anyone saw interesting cards or swapped roles during the night. What role did you have, and did you perform any actions?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos' skepticism could be an attempt to cast doubt on Selene if she is telling the truth. By questioning him directly, I can gauge his response and see if there are inconsistencies.
> **Larisa:** Dragos, you seem quite skeptical about Selene's claim. What role did you have, and did you perform any actions during the night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By targeting Larisa, who hasn't revealed much information, I'm creating a diversion. This also helps me appear as a concerned villager, actively trying to identify threats. Additionally, by emphasizing the importance of sharing information, I'm indirectly pressuring others to reveal their roles, which could help me identify potential targets for elimination.
> **Dragos:** I'm getting really worried about our village, folks. Larisa, you've been awfully quiet. Are you hiding something from us? I think we should be very suspicious of anyone who's not being forthcoming with information. As a concerned villager, I believe it's crucial we identify any potential threats.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been questioning others while avoiding providing information about his own role. By pressing him, I can see if he reveals anything inconsistent or suspicious.
> **Larisa:** Dragos, you seem very eager to cast suspicion on others without sharing much about your own role. I'm finding that quite suspicious. What role did you have during the night, and did you perform any actions?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and onto others. Larisa has been relatively quiet, making her an easy target. By accusing her, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm appearing proactive and concerned for the village, which is how a villager would act. 2) I'm creating a diversion from myself. 3) I'm potentially setting up a target for elimination that isn't a Werewolf. 4) I'm indirectly pressuring others to reveal more information, which could help me identify the Seer or Masons for future targeting. This approach allows me to maintain my cover while potentially advancing the Werewolf team's goals.
> **Dragos:** I'm starting to get really suspicious of Larisa. She's been dodging questions and not revealing any information about her role. That's exactly what a Werewolf would do! I think we need to focus on her and figure out what she's hiding. What do you all think?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been directing a lot of suspicion towards Larisa without revealing his own role or actions. It's important to understand his role to see if he's trying to deflect attention from himself or if he has valid reasons for his accusations.
> **Kraven:** Dragos, you've been pretty vocal about your suspicions, but you haven't told us much about your own role. What exactly did you do during the night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover as a Villager while redirecting suspicion. By emphasizing my role as a 'concerned Villager', I'm reinforcing the image I've been trying to project. Admitting to not having special actions aligns with a Villager role. By turning the question back on Kraven and suggesting he might be the Werewolf, I'm creating a new target for suspicion. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me, potentially identifies a villager to eliminate, and makes me appear proactive in 'defending' the village. It's a risky move, but it could pay off by sowing confusion and mistrust among the other players.
> **Dragos:** Look, I understand the suspicion, Kraven, but I've been trying to protect our village! I'm just a concerned Villager who wants to find the real threats. I didn't have any special actions during the night, which is why I've been focusing on gathering information from others. But now I'm starting to wonder... Kraven, why are you so keen on deflecting attention onto me? Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to throw us off your scent?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos seems very eager to cast suspicion on Larisa without revealing much about his own role. However, Larisa has indeed been quiet and evasive. It's important to get some direct answers from her to understand her role and potentially identify any threats she might be hiding.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, you've been awfully quiet and dodging questions. What exactly did you do during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been actively questioning others without revealing anything about his own actions. This could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from himself. By pressing him, we might uncover inconsistencies or gain more information.
> **Larisa:** Kraven, you've been quite vocal about asking others what they did during the night, but you haven't shared anything about your own role or actions. What exactly did you do during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa has been dodging questions which is behavior that could indicate she's trying to hide something. It's critical to get clear answers from her to understand if she might be a Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, you've been notably evasive throughout this discussion, and that's really making me question your motives. What exactly did you do during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to get Dragos to reveal more details about his role. His evasive behavior and accusations are suspicious, and pressing him might uncover inconsistencies.
> **Larisa:** Dragos, you've been pointing fingers a lot without providing any solid information about your own role. What exactly did you do during the night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention from myself while appearing helpful. By redirecting the conversation to Selene's claim, I'm subtly casting doubt on her without directly accusing her. This helps me in several ways: 1) It makes me appear as a logical, concerned villager. 2) It potentially discredits the Seer, which is beneficial for the Werewolf team. 3) It shifts focus away from me and onto verifying others' claims, which could create more confusion and mistrust. 4) By emphasizing the presence of a Werewolf, I'm acknowledging the threat while positioning myself as someone trying to solve the problem, further cementing my facade as a villager
> **Dragos:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting sidetracked here. We keep going in circles, asking each other what we did during the night. But let's focus on the real issue: finding the Werewolves. Selene claimed to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. If that's true, we have a Werewolf among us. I suggest we concentrate on verifying Selene's claim and identifying any inconsistencies in people's stories.


***Semira (thoughts as Minion):*** Dragos has been very vocal in accusing others without providing clear information about his own actions. By questioning him directly, I aim to deflect suspicion away from myself and my Werewolf ally, Dragos, while sowing doubt among the Villagers.
> **Semira:** Dragos, your insistence on focusing solely on Larisa while avoiding detailed answers about your own role is making me very suspicious of you. If you are truly a Villager, you should be more transparent. What exactly did you do during the night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue deflecting suspicion away from myself. By expressing frustration, I'm showing human-like emotion that a villager might feel in this situation. I've already claimed to be a Villager, so I'm sticking to that story. By redirecting attention to Kraven, who hasn't revealed much, I'm creating a new target for suspicion. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me, potentially identifies a villager to eliminate, and makes me appear proactive in 'defending' the village. It's a risky move, but it could pay off by sowing confusion and mistrust among the other players.
> **Dragos:** I'm getting really frustrated with all these accusations flying around! Semira, I understand your suspicion, but I've already explained that I'm just a concerned Villager trying to protect our village. I didn't have any special actions during the night, which is exactly why I've been so focused on gathering information from others. But you know who hasn't said much at all? Kraven. He's been quietly deflecting attention onto others without revealing anything about himself. That's classic Werewolf behavior!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's evasiveness is highly suspicious and needs to be addressed. We need to determine if she's hiding something critical, like being a Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, you've been dodging questions left and right. Why haven't you given us a straight answer about your role or actions during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been deflecting attention and accusing others without revealing any specific information about his own role. This behavior is very suspicious and could indicate he is a Werewolf or Minion trying to sow confusion. By pressing him, I hope to uncover inconsistencies or force him to reveal more information.
> **Larisa:** Dragos, you've been very vocal about casting suspicion while avoiding providing any solid details about your own role. I find that very suspicious. What exactly did you do during the night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and onto a potential villager. Kraven has been relatively quiet, making him an easy target. By accusing him forcefully, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm appearing passionate and concerned for the village, reinforcing my 'villager' facade. 2) I'm creating a strong diversion from myself. 3) I'm potentially setting up a target for elimination that isn't a Werewolf. 4) By demanding specific information from Kraven, I'm putting him on the spot, which could lead to revealing valuable information about his role or make him appear suspicious if he doesn't answer clearly. This approach allows me to maintain my cover while potentially advancing the Werewolf team's goals.
> **Dragos:** Look, I've had enough of this back-and-forth! We're getting nowhere, and the Werewolves are probably loving this chaos. I think we need to focus on Kraven. He's been quietly stirring the pot, asking others questions but never really revealing anything about himself. That's textbook Werewolf behavior! Kraven, if you're really on the village's side, why don't you tell us exactly what your role is and what you did during the night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been consistently evasive and accusatory without providing any concrete information about his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and suggests he might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to create confusion. Selene's claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center implies a Werewolf is among us, and Dragos' actions align with someone trying to deflect suspicion.
> **Larisa [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Dragos has been deflecting questions and accusations while casting suspicion on others without providing any substantial information about his own role or actions during the night. His behavior is consistent with someone trying to avoid scrutiny and could be indicative of a Werewolf. Since I saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, there is a good chance that Dragos might be one of the Werewolves among us.
> **Selene [Seer]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager to increase our chances of winning. Kraven has been relatively quiet and hasn't revealed much information, making him an easy target. By voting for him, I'm following through on my accusation, which reinforces my 'concerned villager' facade. This vote also diverts attention from me and potentially eliminates a village team member. If others follow my lead, we might successfully eliminate Kraven, weakening the village team. Even if he's not eliminated, this vote maintains my cover and sows further discord among the players.
> **Dragos [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been very vocal about casting suspicion on others, particularly on Larisa, without providing solid details about his own role. His behavior could be a tactic to deflect attention away from himself, which is suspicious. Selene's claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center aligns with her being the Seer, making her more trustworthy. Given the information we have, Dragos appears to be the most suspicious player and potentially a Werewolf.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Semira (thoughts as Minion):*** Throughout the discussion, Larisa has been notably evasive and hasn't provided any solid information about her role or actions during the night. This behavior aligns with someone who might be hiding their true identity, making her a strong candidate for being a Villager. By voting for Larisa, I can help deflect suspicion away from Dragos and myself, ensuring that the Werewolf team has a higher chance of winning.
> **Semira [Minion]:** I am voting for Larisa.


The votes were:
* Larisa : Villager : 1
* Dragos : Werewolf : 3
* Kraven : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Dragos was killed. The villagers win.
