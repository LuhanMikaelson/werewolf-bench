## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to establish myself as a trustworthy Villager and start gathering information from others. This will help me identify who might be the Seer or other key roles so I can protect Mircea.
> **Dracula:** Guys, I think it's time we start sharing what we know. I'd like to come forward as a Villager. I didn't have any special abilities last night, but I'm hoping those of you with more information can help steer us in the right direction. Lucian, do you have anything to share?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing myself and Emil as the Masons, I'm hoping to build trust and narrow down the possibilities for who might be the Werewolves. With both of us known, we can cross off Mason being a potential role for someone to falsely claim, and focus on identifying the real threats. Let's see what others say.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone. I'm a Mason and Emil is the other Mason. This means there are no Masons in the center cards.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** If Lucian and Emil can both confirm that they are Masons, this will help us narrow down the potential Werewolves or other roles.
> **Selene:** Lucian, if you and Emil are the Masons, then that means we should have a Seer or Minion among us too. Emil, can you confirm that you're the other Mason and did you see Lucian last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Confirming Lucian's claim helps establish trust between us two Masons. Since there are no Masons in the center, we should now shift our attention to identifying the Werewolves or the Minion among the remaining players.
> **Emil:** Yes, I can definitely confirm that I'm the other Mason and I saw Lucian last night. Since we know that the Mason cards are not in the center, let's focus on finding the werewolves among Dracula, Selene, and Mircea.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Dracula claimed Villager and Emil confirmed being the other Mason, we need to know more about the roles of the remaining players. This is crucial to identifying the Werewolves. Asking Selene directly puts pressure on her to reveal or potentially slip up if she is hiding something.
> **Lucian:** Selene, if you had any special role last night, now would be the time to share it. We're trying to piece together all the information we can, and your input could be crucial.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula claimed to be a Villager, and Lucian and Emil have confirmed themselves as Masons. If Mircea is hesitant or gives a suspicious response, we might be able to identify if he is the Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Selene:** Mircea, we haven't heard from you yet. Could you tell us what you did last night and what role you claim to have?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself while also sowing doubt about others. Claiming to be a Villager is a safe bet, as it's hard to disprove. By questioning the quick confirmation between Lucian and Emil, I'm trying to cast doubt on their claims without being too aggressive. Directing a question to Selene about her earlier statement serves two purposes: it makes me appear engaged and concerned about finding the truth, while also potentially putting pressure on Selene to reveal more information that could be useful to me as a Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I'm just a simple Villager. I didn't have any special abilities last night, so I can't offer much in terms of information. However, I'm a bit suspicious of how quickly Lucian and Emil confirmed each other as Masons. It seems almost too convenient. Selene, you asked a good question earlier about the Seer or Minion. Did you have any particular reason for mentioning those roles specifically?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's quick accusation of Lucian and Emil feels like a diversion tactic. If we can get more information from him, it might help us identify inconsistencies or reveal more about his true role.
> **Selene:** Mircea, you're claiming to be a Villager, but that makes things tricky since Dracula also claims to be a Villager. Given that Lucian and Emil have confirmed themselves as Masons, it seems we have some conflicting claims here. Mircea, why are you suspicious of Lucian and Emil so quickly confirming their roles? Do you have any more information that might help us?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself while also maintaining my cover as a Villager. By appearing to accept Lucian and Emil's claims, I'm trying to build trust. I'm also attempting to normalize the presence of multiple Villagers to protect my own claim. By shifting focus to the Werewolf and Minion, I'm indirectly suggesting that Selene might be one of these roles, potentially making her a target. This also allows me to gather more information without revealing anything about my true role.
> **Mircea:** Listen, everyone, I understand the suspicion, but I think we're getting sidetracked here. Selene, I'm not suspicious of Lucian and Emil confirming their roles quickly - that's what Masons do. I mentioned it earlier to ensure we're being thorough, but I believe them. What I'm more concerned about is why you're so focused on the Villager claims. Remember, there are three Villager cards in play, so it's entirely possible for both Dracula and me to be Villagers. I think we should be more worried about finding the Werewolf or the Minion. Has anyone seen anything suspicious last night that they haven't shared yet?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** We have two conflicting Villager claims between Dracula and Mircea. Since Lucian and I are confirmed Masons, we need to narrow down the suspicions. Pressuring Dracula might reveal inconsistencies or additional information that can help us identify the Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Emil:** Dracula, you claim to be a Villager, but we have two Villager claims and only three Villager cards. I want to hear more from you because something feels off here. Can you provide more details about what you observed last night or any interactions you had?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** By pushing Selene to reveal her role, I can gather more information. If she claims to be the Seer, I can cast doubt on her or redirect suspicion. By addressing Emil's question, I deflect suspicion from myself and Mircea.
> **Dracula:** Emil, I find it curious that you're pressing me for more details when you've already claimed to be a Mason. If you and Lucian are indeed Masons, it should be clear that the Seer or Minion should speak up. But let's not forget that there are three Villager cards in play. Both Mircea and I could very well be Villagers. Selene, you haven't stated your role yet. If you're the Seer, now would be the time to reveal what you saw last night.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Since both Lucian and Emil have confirmed themselves as Masons and I know I am a Villager, it means one of the Villager claims (Dracula or Mircea) must be lying. I need to delve deeper into Dracula's claim to see if his story holds up.
> **Selene:** Dracula, you've claimed to be a Villager, but so has Mircea. We know there are three Villagers in play and I've been quiet for a reason. I can confirm I'm a Villager too, which makes me suspicious of you. Explain why we should trust you over Mircea.


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** I need to create doubt around Selene to protect Mircea. By focusing on her, I can deflect suspicion from myself and Mircea, and potentially flush out more information from other players.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and assess the situation. So far, we have two confirmed Masons, Lucian and Emil. Mircea and I are claiming to be Villagers, and Selene has just claimed to be a Villager too. But there are only three Villager cards, which means one of us has to be lying. I'm sticking to my claim as a Villager, but Selene, your hesitation to reveal your role earlier makes me suspicious. Why should we believe you over Mircea or myself?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Given the current situation, it's critical to hear from anyone who has more information, especially the Seer. This will help us narrow down the potential Werewolves or Minion, and Dracula's defensiveness makes him a bit more suspicious to me.
> **Selene:** Listen, everyone. We have a dilemma here with three Villager claims between Dracula, Mircea, and myself. Given that Lucian and Emil are confirmed Masons, we need to focus on finding inconsistencies. Dracula, you seem very defensive over your Villager claim, but let's not forget there are other roles we're not hearing about. If anyone is the Seer, now would be the perfect time to share what you saw.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself while also sowing doubt about others. By questioning Selene's earlier interest in the Seer and Minion roles, I'm attempting to cast suspicion on her without being too aggressive. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear engaged and concerned about finding the truth, potentially puts pressure on Selene to reveal more information, and most importantly, it diverts attention away from my own Werewolf status. If I can successfully paint Selene as suspicious, it might lead the group to vote for her instead of me.
> **Mircea:** Alright, everyone, I think we're getting a bit too caught up in the Villager claims. Let's take a step back and consider something else. We haven't heard anything about the Seer or the Minion yet. Selene, you brought these roles up earlier. I find it interesting that you're now claiming to be a Villager when you seemed so interested in those other roles before. Are you sure you're not hiding something from us?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's insight could help us narrow down the suspects. If he's already suspicious of Dracula, understanding his reasoning could guide us towards identifying inconsistencies in Dracula's story or actions.
> **Selene:** Emil, you've been pretty vocal about wanting to hear more from Dracula. Since you're one of the confirmed Masons, could you clarify why you're suspicious of Dracula and not Mircea? We need to understand your reasoning better to make an informed decision.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been overly defensive and quick to redirect suspicion onto others. This kind of behavior is often indicative of someone trying to hide their true role. By confronting Dracula directly, we might be able to get more information or force a slip-up that reveals his true identity.
> **Emil:** Okay, everyone, let's think logically here. Lucian and I are confirmed Masons. That leaves three people claiming to be Villagers: Dracula, Selene, and Mircea. Given that there are only three Villager cards, one of you is definitely lying. Dracula, you've been very defensive and quick to redirect suspicion. I find that very suspicious.


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Selene, I can divert suspicion away from Mircea, who is the Werewolf. This will help protect him and create more confusion among the Village team, making it harder for them to identify the real threat.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, I've been thinking, and something just doesn't add up here. Mircea is claiming to be a Villager just like me and Selene, but let's not forget that Emil and Lucian have confirmed each other as Masons. If we assume that all three Villager claims are true, which is possible since there are three Villager cards, then one of us must be lying. And I'm starting to believe that person is Selene. She's been very cautious and avoided claiming a role for a long time. If we want to find the Werewolf, we should start by questioning Selene more closely.


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Selene directly and casting doubt on her Villager claim, I can deflect suspicion away from Mircea, the Werewolf. This will help protect Mircea and create more confusion among the Village team, making it harder for them to identify the real threat.
> **Dracula:** Selene, I'm really struggling to believe your Villager claim. You were very hesitant to reveal your role, and now that you have, it feels like a defensive move. Why should we trust you over the other Villagers? Can you provide any concrete evidence or observations from last night that may help us?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Lucian and Emil have confirmed each other as Masons, understanding their reasoning could help in identifying inconsistencies. This might also shed light on potential gaps in their story or confirm their authenticity.
> **Selene:** Lucian, you've been vocal in confirming Emil as a Mason, but I need to understand why you two are so certain. Could you explain more about why you're both so confident in each other's roles?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** I believe Selene is the biggest threat to our team. She was hesitant to reveal her role and has been trying to direct attention away from herself. By voting for Selene, I aim to protect Mircea, the Werewolf, and create enough confusion to secure a win for the Werewolf team.
> **Dracula [Minion]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Based on the interactions during the day phase, Dracula has been defensive and quick to redirect suspicion, which is a common tactic used by Werewolves or Minions trying to avoid detection. Given that Lucian and Emil have confirmed themselves as Masons and I know I am a Villager, it seems likely that Dracula is not being truthful. By voting for Dracula, we have a better chance of uncovering one of the Werewolves.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's hesitation to reveal her role and her focus on the Seer and Minion roles make her suspicious. Emil and I are confirmed Masons, and Dracula and Mircea's Villager claims are plausible. This leaves Selene as the most likely candidate for being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's defensive behavior and attempts to redirect suspicion make him the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf or Minion. By voting for him, we increase our chances of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Emil [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate villagers. Selene has been the most suspicious throughout the game, changing her story and being hesitant to reveal her role. By voting for her, I'm aligning myself with the suspicions raised by others, particularly Dracula and Emil. This makes me appear more trustworthy while potentially eliminating a villager. Additionally, focusing suspicion on Selene helps keep attention away from my true role as the Werewolf.
> **Mircea [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Selene.


The votes were:
* Dracula : Minion : 2
* Selene : Villager : 3



>***GAME:*** Selene was killed. The werewolves win.
