## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Marius. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Selene is a minion and is aware that Marius is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dracula. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Kraven. They are thinking about their action.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather information about the roles that are not in play which will help narrow down the possible roles of the other players. This can provide useful information for the village team to deduce who the werewolves might be.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. By asking Selene, I can gather more information about what roles are in play and potentially catch any inconsistencies in her story.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let's get things rolling. I'll start by saying that I suspect one of us might be hiding something. Selene, what did you see during the night?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to redirect any potential suspicion away from myself and subtly probe Marius to see how he handles the pressure. This will also help me identify if anyone else claims to have seen anything contradictory.
> **Selene:** You know, Dracula, I didn't see much during the night because I was just a simple Villager. But I do have a feeling that there might be someone here who's not being entirely honest. Marius, can you tell us what you saw last night?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By claiming to be a Villager like Selene, I create a sense of camaraderie with her. Additionally, by questioning Dracula's motives, I'm attempting to cast suspicion on him instead. This could potentially lead to a divide among the villagers, which would be beneficial for me as the Werewolf. It's also a good opportunity to gather more information about other players' roles without revealing my own.
> **Marius:** Well, Selene, since you're asking, I didn't see much last night either. I'm just a simple Villager like you. But I have to say, Dracula's quick accusation right off the bat seems a bit suspicious to me. Why are you so eager to point fingers, Dracula? Is there something you're trying to hide?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene and Marius have claimed to be Villagers, but it's important to gather more information, especially from players who haven't spoken yet. Kraven's response might give us more clues about who might be hiding something.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, you've been awfully quiet. What did you see during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the center cards that I saw, I can help narrow down the roles that are in play, which is beneficial for the village team. Additionally, Dracula's quick accusation and deflection seem like a way to avoid suspicion, making it worthwhile to question his motives more closely.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's get some clarity here. During the night, I saw two center cards and they were Villager and Mason. This means that we have fewer roles to worry about and can narrow things down. Dracula, your quick accusation and deflection to Selene make me a bit suspicious. Why did you immediately start by pointing fingers?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Marius's quick deflection to me raises some suspicions. If he's truly a Villager, he should be more forthcoming with information instead of just pointing fingers.
> **Dracula:** Marius, your response to Selene's question seemed to shift the focus to me rather quickly. Why so defensive? If you're really a Villager, why not share more information with us?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Kraven's claim of being the Seer. If the group believes him, it could lead to my exposure. By questioning his claim and suggesting he might be the Werewolf, I'm attempting to discredit his information and create confusion among the villagers. This also serves to deflect attention away from myself and potentially set up Kraven as a target for elimination.
> **Marius:** I'm starting to get really suspicious of Kraven. Claiming to be the Seer and saying you saw two center cards is awfully convenient, isn't it? How do we know you're not just making that up to throw us off? For all we know, you could be the Werewolf trying to gain our trust!


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius's strong suspicion and accusation towards me seem like a deflection tactic. If he were truly a Villager, he would likely be more cautious about casting doubt on someone providing useful information.
> **Kraven:** Marius, your reaction seems a bit over the top. If you're truly a Villager, why are you so quick to doubt my claim as the Seer? What do you have to say for yourself?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and create doubt among the villagers. By targeting Dragos, who hasn't spoken yet, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm shifting focus away from Kraven's Seer claim, which could be dangerous for me if believed. 2) I'm presenting myself as an active participant in finding the Werewolf, which helps maintain my cover as a Villager. 3) I'm forcing Dragos to reveal information, which could potentially help me identify other roles. 4) If Dragos turns out to be the Minion, this could give them an opportunity to defend themselves without me directly supporting them. This move keeps the suspicion off me while creating more chaos and confusion among the villagers, which is beneficial for my Werewolf strategy.
> **Marius:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting off track here. Kraven's claim as the Seer is pretty bold, and I'm not entirely convinced. But you know what's even more suspicious? The fact that Dragos hasn't said a word this entire time. What are you hiding, Dragos? Care to share your role with us, or are you just hoping to slide by unnoticed?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula began by accusing someone without providing any information about his own role. This could be a tactic to deflect attention away from himself, which is suspicious behavior.
> **Dragos:** Dracula, I find it interesting how you were so quick to point fingers at Selene. If you're really a Villager, why start by accusing others instead of sharing your own role or observations? What are you hiding?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to push Dragos to reveal more information. His quietness could be a tactic to avoid detection, and this will help us get a clearer picture of his intentions.
> **Dracula:** Dragos, your silence and sudden deflection to me is quite suspicious. What role did you claim again?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's claim removes two potential roles from the pool, but with multiple people claiming to be Villagers, it doesn't add up. I need to understand his reasoning better to decide if he's bluffing.
> **Dragos:** Kraven, you claimed to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, but we have a lot of people claiming Villager here. Why should we believe your claim?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Dragos's silence and sudden attempt to deflect suspicion onto Dracula makes him a prime candidate for further questioning. His reluctance to share information could indicate he has something to hide, potentially being a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Kraven:** Dragos, you've been awfully quiet and only spoke up when you were directly questioned. Why don't you share your role with us? It feels like you're trying to stay under the radar.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's claim doesn't fully align with the number of Villager roles being claimed. Dracula's attempts to shift focus away from himself are typical of someone trying to hide something. This needs to be addressed to clarify the situation.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's think about this logically. Kraven claims to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, but this doesn't add up with the amount of Villager claims we have. If we believe Kraven, that means there should be fewer Villagers among us. Dracula's quick accusations and deflections make me suspicious of him trying to divert attention.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to keep suspicion off myself while also creating doubt among the villagers. By targeting Selene, who hasn't spoken much, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm shifting focus away from myself and Kraven's Seer claim. 2) I'm presenting myself as an active participant in finding the Werewolf, maintaining my cover as a Villager. 3) I'm forcing Selene to reveal more information, which could help me identify other roles. 4) By mentioning the discrepancy between Villager claims and Kraven's statement, I'm subtly casting doubt on Kraven's claim without directly attacking him, which could seem suspicious. This move keeps the suspicion off me while creating more confusion among the villagers, which is beneficial for my Werewolf strategy.
> **Marius:** I think we're getting a bit off track here, folks. Let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. We have multiple Villager claims, which is interesting given what Kraven said about the center cards. But you know who we haven't heard much from? Selene. She claimed to be a Villager early on, but hasn't contributed much since. Selene, can you tell us more about why we should trust you?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Dragos has been relatively quiet, which can be a tactic to avoid suspicion. By redirecting attention towards him, I can help sow confusion and ensure that Marius, the actual Werewolf, stays under the radar. This strategy also helps me gather more information to identify other Village team members for targeted accusations later.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's focus for a moment. We have a lot of Villager claims on the table, and Kraven's assertion about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center complicates things. However, we haven't really pressed Dragos yet, and I find it odd that he hasn't been more active in this discussion.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's behavior has been suspicious from the start with quick accusations and deflections. We need to understand his role better to see if he's hiding something.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's try to piece this together logically. Kraven claims to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, which throws off the number of Villager claims we have. Dracula has been quick to accuse others without providing much useful information, which makes me suspicious. We need more clarity here. Dracula, why were you so quick to accuse Selene at the start? Can you shed some light on your role?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos has been unusually quiet and only spoke up when questioned. His behavior suggests he might be hiding something, and pressing him could reveal more information to help us identify the Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Dragos, your silence and sudden deflection to me is very suspicious. You haven't contributed much to the discussion, and it feels like you're trying to stay under the radar. Why should we trust you? What role did you claim again?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's quick accusations and deflections make him a prime suspect. He hasn't provided any useful information about his own role, which is typical behavior for someone trying to hide something. It's time to put him on the spot and see if he slips up.
> **Dragos:** Dracula, your behavior has been suspicious from the start. You were quick to accuse Selene and have been deflecting attention ever since. Why haven't you been more transparent about your role?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos has been unusually quiet and only speaks up when questioned. Pressing him further might reveal more information or catch him in a lie, which could help us identify if he's hiding something.
> **Dracula:** Dragos, your evasiveness and deflections are getting suspicious. You still haven't given us a clear answer about your role. Why should we trust you?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos has been unusually quiet throughout the discussion and only speaks up when directly questioned. His evasiveness and deflections make him the most suspicious to me. Additionally, his behavior suggests he might be hiding something, and I believe voting for him will give us the best chance to catch a Werewolf.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate a villager. Dracula has been acting suspiciously from the start, making quick accusations and deflecting attention. By voting for him, I'm reinforcing the suspicion against him while maintaining my cover as a concerned villager. This move could potentially eliminate a key village role or, at the very least, create more chaos and distrust among the remaining players, which benefits my position as the Werewolf.
> **Marius [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Dracula has been quick to accuse others and has been deflecting attention away from himself throughout the discussion. This behavior is suspicious and indicates that he might be hiding something. By voting for Dracula, I aim to divert attention away from Marius, the actual Werewolf, and increase the chances of the Werewolf team winning.
> **Selene [Minion]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's behavior has been suspicious from the start with quick accusations and deflections without providing useful information about his own role. This is typical behavior for someone trying to hide something. Additionally, multiple Villager claims and Kraven's assertion about the center cards suggest that someone is lying. Dracula's actions make him the prime suspect for being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Dragos remained silent for much of the discussion and only got defensive when directly questioned. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with someone trying to stay under the radar, which makes me think he could be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Kraven [Seer]:** I am voting for Dragos.


The votes were:
* Dracula : Mason : 3
* Dragos : Villager : 2



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
