## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Stefan. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Michael is a minion and is aware that Stefan is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Cristina. They are thinking about their action.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** By checking another player's card, I can gain direct information about one of my opponents. If Andrei turns out to be a Werewolf or Minion, I can steer the conversation during the day phase to expose him. On the other hand, if he is a Villager or Mason, I can trust his contributions to the discussion.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I know Andrei is a Villager, I want to give him an opportunity to confirm this and build trust among us. This will also help establish a baseline for the rest of the discussion.
> **Cristina:** I think it's important to start by sharing some information. Andrei, can you tell us what role you are claiming?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Cristina initiated the request for information, I want to hear her claim. This can help us start piecing together the roles and build a clearer picture of the situation.
> **Andrei:** Cristina, I claim to be a Villager. What role are you claiming?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing my role as the Seer and confirming Andrei as a Villager, we can establish a trustworthy baseline to guide our discussion. This will help us focus on identifying the Werewolves or the Minion among the remaining players.
> **Cristina:** I'm claiming to be the Seer. Last night, I checked Andrei's card and can confirm he is a Villager. This should help narrow down our suspects.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has claimed to be the Seer and confirmed me as a Villager. To narrow down the suspects further, we need more information from other players. Since Michael hasn't said anything yet, it's time for him to reveal his role.
> **Andrei:** Michael, what role are you claiming?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Since Cristina and Andrei have made their claims, we need to gather more information from other players to piece together the puzzle. If Ileana reveals her role, it might help us identify contradictions or suspicious behavior.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, I think it's crucial for us to narrow down our suspects. Cristina has claimed to be the Seer and confirmed Andrei as a Villager, but that doesn't mean they're off the hook just yet. Ileana, what role are you claiming?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible to identify inconsistencies and potential Werewolves. Since Cristina and Andrei's claims seem to align for now, it's important to hear from other players to narrow down our suspects.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, let's get some clarity here. Since Cristina has claimed to be the Seer and confirmed Andrei as a Villager, let's hear from Stefan next. Stefan, what role are you claiming?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. Claiming to be a Mason and implicating Michael as the other Mason serves multiple purposes. First, it gives me a seemingly innocent role. Second, it puts pressure on Michael to either confirm or deny my claim, potentially causing confusion. If he denies it, I can argue that he might be lying to protect himself. If he confirms it, it might make others suspicious of both of us. This strategy also indirectly casts doubt on Cristina's Seer claim, as there can't be both a Seer and two Masons if Andrei is indeed a Villager. This sows discord among the village team, making it harder for them to identify the real Werewolf.
> **Stefan:** Well, since you're asking, I'm actually one of the Masons. I woke up during the night and saw that Michael is the other Mason. This information should help us narrow down our search for the Werewolves. What do you think about that, Michael?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to create confusion and cast doubt on the roles of others. By questioning Ileana, I can gather more information and potentially catch her in a contradiction, which would help protect Stefan, the actual Werewolf. Additionally, by not outright disagreeing with Stefan, I avoid immediate suspicion on myself.
> **Michael:** First of all, Stefan, that's a bold claim to make. If you're saying you're a Mason and you saw me as the other Mason, then it would mean that Ileana and Cristina's roles need further scrutiny. Now, Ileana, since Stefan has claimed to be a Mason, and I've been named as the other Mason, I'd like to know what you're claiming. We need to piece together all the information we have to identify the Werewolf.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to validate Stefan's claim as soon as possible. If Michael confirms, we can trust that both are Masons, which narrows down our suspects for the Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** Alright, Stefan, if you're claiming to be a Mason and saw Michael as the other Mason, then we need Michael to confirm or deny this. Michael, do you confirm Stefan's claim about being a Mason?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By asking Ileana directly about her role, we can gather more information and potentially catch her in a contradiction. This will help us steer the conversation and potentially mislead the villagers, keeping Stefan, the actual Werewolf, safe.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, let's put all the cards on the table. Stefan has claimed to be a Mason and saw me as the other Mason. Cristina has claimed to be the Seer and confirmed Andrei as a Villager. This leaves Ileana as the last one we need to hear from. Ileana, if you have an important role, now is the time to reveal it. What role are you claiming?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** It's crucial for us to validate Stefan's claim. If Michael confirms, we can trust that both are Masons, which narrows down our suspects and helps us identify the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Alright, Michael, you're the key to resolving this. Do you confirm or deny Stefan's claim that you are the other Mason?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By focusing on Ileana, we can gather more information and potentially catch her in a contradiction. This will help us steer the conversation and potentially mislead the villagers, keeping Stefan, the actual Werewolf, safe.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, it's time to clear the air. Ileana, Stefan has claimed to be a Mason and saw me as the other Mason. Cristina has claimed to be the Seer and confirmed Andrei as a Villager. If we take all these claims at face value, it doesn't add up. Ileana, what role are you claiming? Let's hear it.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** If Michael confirms Stefan's claim, we can trust both are Masons, which means Cristina and Andrei are more likely telling the truth. This would help us narrow down the suspects and identify the Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** Alright, everyone, let's think this through. Cristina claims to be the Seer and confirmed Andrei as a Villager. Stefan claims to be a Mason and saw Michael as the other Mason. The only person who hasn't aligned with an already claimed role is Michael. Michael, can you confirm that you are indeed the other Mason? If not, we might have found our Werewolf.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to keep the focus on Ileana and create confusion. By questioning her, I can gather more information and potentially paint her as suspicious, which will help protect Stefan, the actual Werewolf. Additionally, this helps divert attention away from Stefan and me.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, there's been a lot of claims flying around. Cristina claims to be the Seer and confirmed Andrei as a Villager. Stefan claims to be a Mason and saw me as the other Mason. Ileana has been unusually quiet and hasn't claimed a role yet. From my perspective, this is quite suspicious. Ileana, you're in the spotlight now. Why haven't you claimed a role yet? This hesitation makes me think you might be hiding something.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** It's essential to validate Stefan's claim to narrow down our suspects. If Michael confirms he is the Mason, we can trust both claims and focus on potential lies or the center cards.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think. Cristina claims to be the Seer and confirmed Andrei as a Villager. Stefan claims to be a Mason and saw Michael as the other Mason. If all these claims are true, it means the Werewolves are either in the center or someone is lying. I find it suspicious that Michael hasn't directly confirmed or denied Stefan's claim yet. Michael, please confirm once and for all, are you the other Mason or not?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Ileana, who hasn't made a clear role claim, I aim to direct suspicion away from Stefan, the actual Werewolf, and myself as the Minion. This will create confusion among the Villagers and potentially lead them to vote for an innocent player, increasing our chances of winning.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, I've been listening to all the claims and something doesn't quite add up. We have Cristina claiming to be the Seer and confirming Andrei as a Villager. Stefan claims to be a Mason and says Iâ€™m the other Mason. Now, we haven't heard a solid role claim from Ileana yet. I'm starting to think we might have a Werewolf trying to hide in plain sight. Given the information we have, I believe Ileana could be the Werewolf among us!


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting suspicion on Ileana, I divert attention away from Stefan, the actual Werewolf, and myself as the Minion. This confusion can lead the Villagers to vote for an innocent player, increasing our chances of winning. Ileana's reluctance to reveal her role is the perfect pretext to accuse her and protect our Werewolf team.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, let's put the pieces together. Cristina claims to be the Seer and confirmed Andrei as a Villager. Stefan claims to be a Mason and saw me as the other Mason. But Ileana, you're still not revealing your role. Given the information we have, I believe Ileana could be the Werewolf among us!


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to redirect suspicion away from Ileana and onto Michael. By questioning Michael's lack of response to my Mason claim, I'm creating doubt about his innocence. This also helps to reinforce my fake Mason role and makes me appear more trustworthy. Additionally, by suggesting Ileana might be a simple Villager, I'm providing a plausible explanation for her silence, which could help protect her if she's the Minion. This move aims to create confusion and division among the village team, making it harder for them to identify me as the real Werewolf.
> **Stefan:** Hold on a minute, Michael! You're awfully quick to point fingers at Ileana without addressing the elephant in the room. I claimed you were the other Mason, and you've been dodging that claim this entire time. If you're not the Mason, then you're likely the Werewolf trying to deflect attention. Ileana's silence could simply mean she's a Villager with no special role to claim. I think we need to focus on Michael here. What do you all think?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's reluctance to confirm or deny being the other Mason suggests he might be hiding something. If Stefan is indeed a Mason, Michael's behavior could indicate he is not on the village team.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, let's break this down logically. Cristina claims to be the Seer and confirmed Andrei as a Villager. Stefan claims to be a Mason and saw Michael as the other Mason. Michael has been very hesitant to confirm or deny Stefan's claim. This hesitation is quite suspicious to me.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Based on the information we've gathered, it's essential to clarify this point. If Michael can confirm Stefan's claim, we can trust them both. If not, we need to consider the possibility that Michael might be hiding something. This will help us narrow down our suspects and identify the Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Alright, everyone, let's pause for a moment. Stefan, you've claimed to be a Mason and said you saw Michael as the other Mason. Michael, it's crucial for you to confirm or deny this claim now. Are you the other Mason?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan has claimed to be a Mason and saw Michael as the other Mason, but Michael has been evasive about confirming or denying this claim. This hesitation is suspicious. Since I know Andrei is a Villager and I am the Seer, it narrows down the suspects. Voting for Michael seems the most logical choice given the current information.
> **Cristina [Seer]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Given the information presented, Cristina's claim to be the Seer and her confirmation of me as a Villager appears credible. Stefan's claim to be a Mason and seeing Michael as the other Mason creates a contradiction, as Michael hasn't confirmed this claim despite multiple prompts. Michael's hesitance and deflection towards Ileana raise significant suspicion. Therefore, I believe Michael is likely to be a Werewolf or Minion, and voting for him maximizes our chances of eliminating a threat.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** My goal as the Minion is to protect the Werewolf, Stefan. By casting suspicion on Ileana, who has been reluctant to reveal her role, I can create enough confusion to divert attention away from Stefan. This will increase the chances of the Werewolf team winning.
> **Michael [Minion]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate a villager. Michael has been evasive about my Mason claim, which makes him an easy target. By voting for Michael, I reinforce my fake Mason role and potentially eliminate a village team member. This move also aligns with the suspicions raised by others, making it seem like a logical choice without revealing my true identity.
> **Stefan [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael has been hesitant and dodging the claim of being the other Mason. Stefan's confident claim that he saw Michael as the other Mason, and Michael's reluctance to confirm this, makes me suspicious that Michael might be the Werewolf. Cristina's claim as the Seer and confirmation of Andrei as a Villager also seems consistent. Therefore, my vote goes to Michael, as he is the most suspicious based on the information we have.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


The votes were:
* Michael : Minion : 4
* Ileana : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The werewolves win.
