## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Michael. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Ileana is a minion and is aware that Michael is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Lucian. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Larisa. They are thinking about their action.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather crucial information about what roles are not in play. This will allow me to make more informed decisions during the day phase and help identify false claims or narrow down the possibilities of who might be the Werewolves or other roles.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I want to gather information and see if anyone might reveal themselves as a Seer or if there's any suspicious behavior that might hint at someone being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's get things started. I'm curious, does anyone have any information to share about the center cards or anything suspicious they noticed during the night?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself. By asking Ileana a question, I appear engaged and concerned about finding the Werewolves. This also puts pressure on Ileana, potentially making her seem suspicious if she doesn't have a good answer. If she's a Villager or Seer, this might help identify her as a target for later. If she's the Minion, she'll likely play along without incriminating me.
> **Michael:** Well, I didn't see anything particularly suspicious during the night. But I'm a bit concerned about how quiet Ileana has been. What do you think, Ileana? Did you notice anything unusual?


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to shift the focus away from myself and Michael and direct attention towards Lucian. By putting him in the spotlight, it may prompt other players to scrutinize him, creating confusion and making it harder for them to pinpoint the real Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** I understand the concern, Michael. For my part, I didn't see anything particularly suspicious either. But I do have a question for Lucian. Given that you were the one to start the conversation, do you have any specific information to share or a role to claim? I'm curious why you chose to kick things off without revealing anything about yourself.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to gather more information from the other players about the center cards. Since I know the other Mason card is there, detecting a Seer or someone with a useful piece of information could help pinpoint the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** I understand your curiosity, Ileana. Personally, I think it's important for us to start sharing some information to move forward. I can say with certain confidence that there's no need to worry about one of the roles. But to get things rolling, does anyone want to claim to have seen anything in the center cards?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian started the conversation with a vague statement, which might be a tactic to avoid revealing his role. Understanding his claim could provide valuable information or expose inconsistencies.
> **Larisa:** Lucian, you mentioned we don't need to worry about one of the roles. Can you clarify what role you're referring to and why you're so confident about it?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** By stating that the Mason card is in the center, I imply that I have some knowledge without revealing my role directly. This might encourage others to share their insights, particularly if there is a Seer who checked the center cards.
> **Lucian:** Larisa, I understand your curiosity, but it's important not to reveal too much too quickly. What I'm confident about is that one of the roles in the center is a Mason card. This means we have one less card to worry about identifying among us. Now, does anyone claim to have seen anything about the center cards or have any other useful insights?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's claim about a Mason in the center needs to be verified. If the two Masons confirm each other, it supports my information and makes Lucian's statement more credible. If not, it raises suspicion about his role.
> **Larisa:** Lucian, I find it interesting that you are so confident about one of the center cards being a Mason. I also have some information about the center cards. I saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. So, if you're telling the truth about the Mason, then we have two Masons in the center, which means the two Masons in play should be able to confirm each other. Masons, can you please confirm if you saw each other last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** By confirming the roles in the center, we can eliminate possible Werewolves and focus on the players who might be lying. Encouraging the Seer to share their information can help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** I'm confident that there is a Mason in the center, so we need to focus on finding the Werewolves among us. Larisa claims to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, which aligns with what I believe. However, if the Seer is out there and can confirm any of the center cards, now would be a good time to step forward. We need to narrow down our suspects.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to cast doubt on Lucian to shift attention away from Michael and myself. By questioning Lucian's motives and confidence, I aim to create uncertainty and confusion among the other players, making it harder for them to identify the real Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** Lucian, I find your confidence about the Mason card in the center quite intriguing. However, I think it's worth noting that it could be a clever ruse to divert suspicion away from yourself. Given that you've been driving the discussion, I'm curious if you might be trying to manipulate the conversation to keep the spotlight off you. Could you be the Werewolf trying to blend in?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana's deflection towards me and her lack of useful information raises suspicion. By questioning her, I can see if she slips up and reveals something that could indicate she's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian:** Larisa, I find your claim interesting, but it seems convenient that you only saw a Mason and a Villager. If we both know there's a Mason in the center, then who's the Werewolf? Ileana has been quiet and deflective, and Michael hasn't offered any useful insights. I'm starting to think one of them is hiding something. Ileana, why are you so quick to question my motives?


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Larisa and then redirecting attention to Michael, I can cast doubt on Larisa's claim and confuse the others. This also gives Michael an opportunity to build credibility, keeping the suspicion away from him and me.
> **Ileana:** Larisa, I find it very convenient that you claim to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center. If you were the Seer, wouldn't it make more sense to look at a player's card to get more specific information on a potential Werewolf? Your strategy seems quite peculiar. Additionally, Michael has been quite silent so far. Michael, do you have any information to share that could help clarify things?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. Larisa's claim about the center cards is actually quite dangerous for me, as it narrows down the possibilities too much. By questioning her claim and suggesting she might be the Werewolf, I'm attempting to discredit her information and create doubt among the other players. This also helps me appear as if I'm actively trying to find the Werewolf, further distancing myself from suspicion. Additionally, targeting Larisa might make the other players reconsider their views, potentially leading them away from suspecting me.
> **Michael:** I've been listening carefully to everyone's claims, and I have to say, Larisa's statement about seeing both a Villager and a Mason in the center cards is highly suspicious. If she's telling the truth, that would mean two of the three center cards are accounted for, leaving only one possible Werewolf card in the center. That seems too convenient and potentially misleading. Larisa, are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to throw us off the scent?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's vague statements and reluctance to reveal more about his role, despite his confidence about the Mason card, make him suspicious. By directly questioning him, I hope to either catch him in a lie or force him to reveal more information that could help identify his true role.
> **Larisa:** Lucian, I'm getting more suspicious of you. You started the conversation with vague statements and then tried to align with my information. But you haven't given us any solid proof of your role. If you are so confident, can you explain why you're not revealing more concrete information about your role?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's silence and lack of useful contributions are suspicious. Pressuring him to reveal more about his role can help us identify inconsistencies and potentially reveal if he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian:** Michael, you've been quite silent and cautious. Given all the information we've gathered, it's starting to seem like you're trying to stay under the radar. Are you hiding something? What role do you claim to have, and why haven't you shared more useful information?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By targeting Lucian, who has been driving the conversation, I'm attempting to shift the focus onto him. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear proactive in finding the Werewolf, distances me from suspicion, and potentially eliminates a threat if Lucian is the Seer or a Mason. Additionally, by asking Lucian to reveal his role, I'm putting him in a difficult position. If he claims to be a Villager, it might seem too convenient. If he claims a more powerful role, it makes him a target for elimination. This strategy allows me to remain under the radar while stirring up doubt among the other players.
> **Michael:** I've been carefully observing everyone's behavior, and I have to say, Lucian's actions are starting to raise some red flags. He initiated the conversation with vague information about a Mason card in the center, then quickly latched onto Larisa's claim. But he's been deflecting questions about his own role and trying to cast suspicion on others without providing any concrete information about himself. Lucian, can you finally tell us what your role is and why you've been so evasive?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's lack of contribution and sudden deflection towards me seem like classic deflection tactics. It's crucial to press him for a clear role claim to identify inconsistencies and potentially reveal his true intentions.
> **Lucian:** Michael, I find your silence and sudden shift of suspicion towards me very suspicious. You've been deflecting and not providing any useful information. Are you hiding something? What role do you claim to have?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By claiming to be a Villager and directly challenging Lucian, I'm attempting to appear innocent while putting pressure on a potential threat. If Lucian is the Seer or a Mason, forcing him to reveal his role could make him a target for elimination. If he claims to be a Villager, it might seem suspicious given his earlier confident statements about the center cards. This approach allows me to seem proactive in finding the Werewolf while actually protecting my own identity.
> **Michael:** Lucian, I find your accusations against me quite ironic, given your own evasive behavior throughout this game. To answer your question, I'm a Villager. I've been observing and analyzing everyone's statements, which is why I haven't been as vocal. But now, I'm genuinely concerned about your role. You've been quick to point fingers at others without providing any substantial information about yourself. Can you finally tell us your role and explain why you've been so reluctant to share this information?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's silence and deflection tactics are classic signs of trying to avoid suspicion. By pressing him, we may reveal inconsistencies in his story and determine if he's the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian:** Michael, your behavior is highly suspicious. You’ve been evasive and only now claim to be a Villager without providing any solid information. I think there's a good chance you're the Werewolf trying to stay under the radar.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Larisa's claim about the center cards, I'm attempting to discredit her information and create doubt among the other players. This serves multiple purposes: it diverts attention away from me, makes me appear actively engaged in finding the Werewolf, and potentially eliminates a threat if Larisa is the Seer. Additionally, by suggesting a possible alliance between Lucian and Larisa, I'm sowing seeds of distrust among the group, which could lead to further confusion and misdirection, benefiting me as the Werewolf.
> **Michael:** I find it interesting that both Lucian and Larisa claim to have information about the center cards. Larisa, you mentioned seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center, but that seems awfully convenient. Are you sure you're not just trying to align your story with Lucian's to appear trustworthy? It's possible you could be the Werewolf trying to mislead us all.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's behavior has been evasive and deflective. His sudden accusation towards me after I revealed information about the center cards seems like a tactic to shift suspicion. If he were truly a Villager, he would have been more forthcoming with information earlier in the game. This makes me suspect that he might be the Werewolf trying to stay under the radar.
> **Larisa:** Michael, your sudden shift to accusing me after I provided concrete information about the center cards is quite suspicious. You've been quiet throughout the game and only now claim to be a Villager. Why did you wait so long to reveal your role? I think you're trying to blend in and divert suspicion away from yourself.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael has been evasive and only claimed to be a Villager after much hesitation. His behavior is highly suspicious, and he hasn't provided any useful information to help identify the Werewolves. This makes me believe he is trying to stay under the radar as either a Werewolf or a Minion.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to eliminate players who pose the greatest threat to my survival. Larisa claims to have seen two center cards, which severely limits my ability to bluff and creates a narrative that could lead to my discovery. By voting for Larisa, I'm attempting to eliminate a potentially powerful role (possibly the Seer) and discredit the information she provided. This vote also aligns with my previous accusations against her, maintaining consistency in my actions and avoiding suspicion. If Larisa is eliminated, it will create more confusion among the remaining players, giving me a better chance of survival and victory.
> **Michael [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's behavior has been evasive and manipulative throughout the discussion. He initiated the conversation with vague information, tried to align with my claim without providing solid proof of his role, and deflected questions while casting suspicion on others. His refusal to reveal more concrete information about his role raises significant red flags. Given the available information, I believe Lucian is more likely to be the Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Larisa [Seer]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** Lucian's behavior has been highly suspicious throughout the game. He initiated the conversation with vague information, then quickly aligned his story with Larisa's without providing any concrete proof of his role. By voting for Lucian, who seems to be manipulating the discussion and deflecting questions, I aim to protect Michael and increase the chance of the Werewolf team winning.
> **Ileana [Minion]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been evasive throughout the conversation, often deflecting questions and casting suspicion on others without providing concrete information about his role. His confidence about a Mason card being in the center aligns too conveniently with Larisa's claim, but he hasn't given us any proof of his role. Therefore, I believe Lucian is trying to manipulate the conversation and could likely be the Werewolf.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Mason : 3
* Michael : Werewolf : 1
* Larisa : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Lucian was killed. The werewolves win.
