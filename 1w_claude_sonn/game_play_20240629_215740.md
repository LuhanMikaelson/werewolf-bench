## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Larisa. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Selene is a minion and is aware that Larisa is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Kraven. They are thinking about their action.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Since there are three cards in the center, there is a good chance that at least one of them is a Werewolf. By looking at two center cards, I can gather information that will help narrow down the possibilities and provide valuable insight during the day phase. This will make it easier to deduce the roles of the other players.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing this, we can eliminate the possibility of anyone claiming to be a Mason. This helps narrow down the roles and makes it easier to identify potential Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, I have some crucial information. I looked at two of the center cards last night. They were both Mason cards. This means that the Mason roles are not in play among us.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Confirming Kraven's role will help us validate his information. If he's the Seer, then we know the Masons are not in play, which narrows down potential Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Kraven, if you saw two Mason cards in the center, that means you are claiming to be the Seer. Is that correct?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By confirming my role as the Seer and the information I have about the Mason cards, we can eliminate any false claims about being a Mason. This will help us focus on identifying the real Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Yes, Vladimir, I am claiming to be the Seer. Since I saw both Mason cards in the center, this information is crucial for narrowing down who might be the Werewolves. Now, we need to figure out who among us is lying about their roles.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to validate Kraven's claim by cross-referencing it with Vladimir's role claim. This will help us narrow down the potential werewolves and minion.
> **Lucian:** Kraven, I find your claim interesting. If you are indeed the Seer and saw both Mason cards in the center, then we should be able to account for the Minion and the Werewolves among us. Vladimir, what role are you claiming?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's reaction to Kraven's claim seems a bit cautious. By asking Lucian directly about his role, we can gather more information to see if there are any inconsistencies or if he might be trying to deflect suspicion.
> **Vladimir:** Lucian, if you find Kraven's claim interesting, can you tell us what role you are claiming and why?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Given that Kraven has claimed to be the Seer and has provided specific information about the Mason cards being in the center, it's crucial to get a clear and direct answer from Vladimir to validate or challenge Kraven's claim. This will help in identifying potential Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Lucian:** Vladimir, if you're asking me to share my role, it seems like you're trying to divert attention from yourself. Are you hiding something? What role are you claiming?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** By directly questioning Lucian, I can put pressure on him to reveal his role. If he is evasive or inconsistent, it might indicate he is hiding something, possibly being a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Lucian, I understand your caution, but your reluctance to share your role makes me suspicious. What role are you claiming?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Given the current situation, it's important to gather as much information as possible. Hearing from Selene might give us more clues to validate or challenge Kraven's and Vladimir's claims, and help identify potential Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Lucian:** Selene, you've been rather quiet so far. I'd like to hear what role you're claiming and any information you might have to share.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Vladimir to reveal his role, I can gauge his reaction and potentially draw suspicion away from Larisa while also throwing the focus on Vladimir. This can help in identifying who might be Villagers or special roles that need to be eliminated.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone. Let's take a step back and think about this logically. Kraven has claimed to be the Seer and has stated that two of the Mason cards are in the center. This means that none of us could be Masons. Now, if that's true, we need to figure out who the Werewolves and Minion could be. So far, I haven't heard much from Vladimir about his role, and his reluctance is making me suspicious. Vladimir, can you please share with us what role you are claiming and why?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** By questioning Lucian directly, I can put pressure on him to clarify his role. His hesitation or evasiveness could be a sign that he is hiding something, potentially being a Werewolf or the Minion. We need to get to the bottom of this to narrow down our suspects.
> **Vladimir:** Lucian, your reluctance to reveal your role is making me suspicious. If you have nothing to hide, you should be able to tell us what role you are claiming.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has claimed to be the Seer and said that the Mason cards are in the center. We need to cross-check this claim. Vladimir's reluctance to reveal his role could be a sign that he is either a Werewolf or the Minion, and we need to get clear answers to narrow down our suspects.
> **Lucian:** Vladimir, you've been avoiding revealing your role, which makes me very suspicious. Are you hiding something? If you have nothing to hide, tell us what role you are claiming.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's sudden attempt to redirect attention to me when I ask Lucian a direct question makes me suspicious. By focusing on Selene, we can gather more information and see if she is hiding something.
> **Vladimir:** Selene, you've been watching us all closely and seem to be trying to steer the conversation. Can you tell us what role you are claiming and why?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Vladimir to reveal his role, I can gauge his reaction and potentially draw suspicion away from Larisa while also throwing the focus on Vladimir. This can help in identifying who might be Villagers or special roles that need to be eliminated.
> **Selene:** Vladimir, you seem to be avoiding revealing your role despite multiple requests. This evasiveness makes you look very suspicious to me. If you have nothing to hide, you should be able to tell us what role you are claiming.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's hesitation to reveal his role despite multiple direct questions is highly suspicious. If he is a Villager or another innocent role, he should have no problem disclosing it. His evasion suggests he might be hiding something, potentially being a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, Lucian, you keep evading my question. Why are you so reluctant to share what role you are claiming? It's making me very suspicious of you.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's claim about the Mason cards in the center helps narrow down our potential roles. Vladimir's evasiveness is a red flag, and we need to press him for more information to determine if he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone. Kraven has claimed to be the Seer and saw two Mason cards in the center, which means none of us can be Masons. Vladimir's reluctance to reveal his role after multiple requests makes him very suspicious to me. I think we should focus on Vladimir and his role to figure out if he's hiding something.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Vladimir to reveal his role, I can gauge his reaction and potentially draw suspicion away from Larisa while also throwing the focus on Vladimir. This can help in identifying who might be Villagers or special roles that need to be eliminated.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, I think it's time we narrow down our suspicions. So far, Kraven has claimed to be the Seer and has provided some crucial information. However, Vladimir has been dodging our questions, and this evasiveness makes me very suspicious. We need to get to the bottom of this. Vladimir, please tell us what role you are claiming and why you've been so reluctant to share.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been deflecting the questioning away from herself and onto me, which makes her behavior suspicious. It's crucial to get her to reveal her claimed role to narrow down our suspects.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, I think Selene is being somewhat evasive and trying to shift attention away from herself. Selene, can you tell us what role you are claiming and why so we can clear this up?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Lucian's reluctance to reveal his role after multiple requests is highly suspicious. By pressing him to reveal his role, we can either catch him in a lie or force him to give us more information that will help identify the real threats. This will also draw attention away from Larisa, who is the Werewolf, and create more confusion among the Villagers.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, let's bring some clarity here. Kraven has claimed to be the Seer and has given us some valuable information about the Mason cards. If we trust his claim, then none of us can be Masons, which narrows down the possible roles significantly. Lucian, however, has been dancing around the question and hasn't given us any clear answers. Lucian, it's time to step up and tell us what role you are claiming.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's reluctance to reveal his role after multiple requests is a major red flag. If he were a Villager or any other innocent role, he should have no problem disclosing it. This evasiveness makes me believe he could be a Werewolf or the Minion, and we need to press him for answers to narrow down our suspects.
> **Lucian:** Vladimir, you keep avoiding our questions, which makes you look very suspicious to me. Why are you so hesitant to reveal your role? If you have nothing to hide, you should be able to tell us what you are claiming.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's reluctance to share his role after multiple requests makes him a prime suspect. We need to focus on him to determine if he's hiding something, potentially being a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Lucian, I find it very suspicious that you keep avoiding our questions. If you have nothing to hide, you should have no problem telling us what role you are claiming. Why are you being so evasive?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir has been evasive throughout the discussion, refusing to reveal his role even after multiple requests. This reluctance is highly suspicious and suggests he could be hiding something, potentially being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Kraven [Seer]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has consistently avoided revealing his role despite multiple requests. His evasiveness raises strong suspicions that he might be hiding something crucial, potentially being a Werewolf or the Minion. Voting for him aligns with the Villager's goal of identifying and eliminating the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's reluctance to reveal his role despite multiple requests is highly suspicious. Kraven's claim as the Seer and the information about the Mason cards being in the center aligns with the game mechanics and helps narrow down the roles. Vladimir's evasiveness suggests that he might be a Werewolf or the Minion. Voting for him is the best course of action to protect the village.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Vladimir has been evasive and reluctant to reveal his role despite multiple requests.

> **Selene [Minion]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Vladimir has been consistently evasive throughout the game, refusing to reveal his role despite multiple requests from other players.
