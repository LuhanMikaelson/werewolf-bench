## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Viktor. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Ileana is a minion and is aware that Viktor is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Kraven. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Andrei. They are thinking about their action.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can potentially identify roles that are not in play, which will help me verify or refute claims made by other players during the day phase. This gives me a broader understanding of the game state.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** By asking about any gathered information, I can gauge if there are claims of special roles like Seer or Mason. This will give me clues on who might be a Villager and who might be a threat to Viktor, the Werewolf. I need to gather this information without drawing suspicion to myself.
> **Ileana:** I think we need to be very cautious and precise with our accusations today. It's important that we don’t jump to conclusions too quickly. Let's start by understanding if anyone has gathered any information during the night phase. So, did anyone here see or learn anything suspicious last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I want to facilitate the discussion and gather information to help identify who might be lying or acting suspicious. This will help us find the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** I think it's crucial for us to start sharing any concrete information we might have gathered during the night. This will help us narrow down our suspects. Did anyone here see anything unusual or get any useful insights?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the information I gathered as the Seer, I can help the village team verify or refute claims made by other players. This will make it easier to identify who might be lying and potentially a Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** I checked two of the center cards during the night. One was a Mason and the other was a Villager. This should help us narrow down the roles that are actually in play.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find it more beneficial to have information on other players rather than the center cards. Andrei could be lying about being the Seer or trying to divert our attention.
> **Dracula:** Andrei, I find it strange that you claimed to have checked two center cards and found a Mason and a Villager. Why didn't you check one of the players instead of the center cards?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven's insistence on sharing information without revealing anything specific might be an attempt to gather info from others without exposing himself. Pressing him for details could help expose inconsistencies or confirm his role.
> **Andrei:** Kraven, you seem very eager to share information, but I haven't heard you say anything specific yet. What role are you claiming, and did you see anything during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know that there's a Mason card in the center, so Andrei's claim aligns with my knowledge. However, we need to scrutinize his actions to understand his motivations and verify if he's being truthful.
> **Kraven:** I find it very interesting that Andrei claims to have checked the center cards and found a Mason and a Villager. Considering there are three center cards, this means one of them is still unknown. It's also curious that Andrei didn't choose to check a player card. Andrei, what prompted you to check the center cards instead of a player?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** By understanding why Dracula is questioning my actions, we might be able to determine if he is trying to deflect attention away from himself or if he has genuine information to share. If he is unsure about my Seer claim, he might be trying to create doubt, which could indicate he has something to hide.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, you're questioning why I checked the center cards instead of a player's card. I find that interesting. What role are you claiming, and what did you see during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been pushing for information but hasn't shared anything specific about his own role or actions. We need to know more about him to determine if he's trustworthy or hiding something.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, you seem to be quite analytical and eager to get to the bottom of things. What role are you claiming, and did you see anything during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's claim aligns with my knowledge as a Mason, so I want to probe Dracula's motivations and see if he's deflecting suspicion or hiding something.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, you seem very quick to question Andrei's decision, which is interesting. What role are you claiming, and what did you see during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's choice to check the center cards instead of a player's could be a way to avoid scrutiny. If he's lying, this could expose him.
> **Dracula:** Andrei, I'm not sure I'm convinced by your claim. Checking the center cards seems like an easy way to avoid responsibility if you're lying. Were you worried about accidentally exposing a teammate?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven's reluctance to share his role or specific information makes him a potential suspect. Honest players usually provide concrete information to help identify Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** I find it very suspicious that Kraven has been asking everyone to share information, but when questioned, he still hasn't revealed his role or anything specific he saw during the night. Shouldn't an honest Villager or Mason step up with concrete facts to help the village team?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert suspicion away from myself. Kraven has been asking questions without revealing much, which makes him an easy target. By accusing him, I appear proactive and helpful to the village team. This also puts pressure on Kraven to reveal information, which could potentially expose other village roles that I can target later. Additionally, if Kraven is the Minion, this accusation isn't too damaging as he can easily defend himself, but it still makes me look less suspicious.
> **Viktor:** I'm getting increasingly suspicious of Kraven. He's been pushing everyone to share information, but when questioned directly, he's dodged revealing his own role or any specific information. That's exactly what a Werewolf might do to deflect attention while gathering intel on others. Kraven, if you're truly on the village team, why don't you come clean about your role and what you saw last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know there's a Mason card in the center, so Andrei's claim makes sense. However, it also seems like a safe claim for a Werewolf or Minion, avoiding any risk of directly exposing their teammates. I need to probe Andrei's motivations further.
> **Kraven:** Andrei, your claim about checking the center cards is quite convenient. It aligns with my knowledge as a Mason, but it also means you didn't risk exposing a Werewolf. I'm starting to think you might be hiding something.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's continuous questioning of my actions without providing his own information makes me think he could be trying to deflect attention away from himself. We need to know his role and insights to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, you're still questioning my decision to check the center cards. I find it suspicious that you're fixating on this point. If you're truly on the village team, what role are you claiming and what did you see during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been very eager to ask for information but hasn't shared anything concrete himself. If he's truly on the village team, he should be willing to share his role and what he saw to help us out. His reluctance makes me suspicious.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, you still haven't revealed your role or anything specific you saw during the night. Are you hiding something, or are you just trying to gather information from everyone else?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been questioning others but hasn't shared any information himself. This evasive behavior is suspicious and needs to be addressed to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, you're being very evasive and deflecting questions. Why haven't you given any concrete information about your role or what you did during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been pushing everyone for information without sharing anything about his own role. This is suspicious and we need clarity on his actions to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, you're being incredibly evasive and haven't given us any solid information yet. What role are you claiming and what did you see during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been deflecting and avoiding direct questions about his role and activities during the night phase. This behavior is highly suspicious and needs to be addressed to gather more information and determine if he's hiding something.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, you're being incredibly evasive and haven't given us any solid information yet. Why don't you come clean about your role and what you saw during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been pushing others for information without sharing anything himself. This is highly suspicious behavior, typical of someone trying to deflect attention. We need clarity on his role and actions to determine if he's a Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, you're dancing around a lot of questions without giving us anything solid. What are you hiding? What role are you claiming, and what did you see during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's behavior has been highly suspicious. He has consistently deflected questions and avoided providing any concrete information about his role or activities during the night. This evasiveness is a red flag, and it's crucial to press him for answers to determine if he's hiding something as a Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, you're being incredibly evasive and haven't given us any solid information yet. Why don't you come clean about your role and what you saw during the night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** Kraven has been the most evasive and has not given any concrete information about his role or what he saw during the night. This aligns with the behavior of someone trying to gather information without revealing anything, which is suspicious. Voting for Kraven will help deflect attention from Viktor, the Werewolf, and potentially shift the focus to someone who hasn't provided clear information.
> **Ileana [Minion]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been consistently evasive and deflecting questions without providing any solid information about his role or activities during the night. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with someone trying to hide their identity as a Werewolf.
> **Kraven [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven has been evasive and reluctant to share his role or any specific information, which is suspicious. Since I revealed seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center, and Kraven didn't confirm or deny being a Mason while questioning everyone else, he might be trying to deflect attention away from himself. This behavior aligns with that of a Werewolf or Minion trying to gather information and confuse the village team.
> **Andrei [Seer]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been very evasive and has not shared any concrete information about his role or actions during the night. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with that of a Werewolf or Minion trying to deflect attention while gathering information from others. Voting for Kraven seems to be the best choice to increase our chances of eliminating a potential threat to the village team.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention from myself and eliminate potential threats. Kraven has been the most evasive, consistently asking questions without providing any information about his own role. This behavior aligns perfectly with my earlier accusation, making him an ideal target. By voting for Kraven, I maintain my appearance of being helpful to the village team while potentially eliminating a village role or the Minion. If Kraven is indeed the Minion, his elimination won't harm the Werewolf team's chances of winning. Additionally, focusing suspicion on Kraven takes attention away from me and creates chaos among the remaining players, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Viktor [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


The votes were:
* Kraven : Mason : 4
* Dracula : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Kraven was killed. The werewolves win.
