## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Larisa. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Kraven and Andrei. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Vladimir. They are thinking about their action.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can confirm which roles are not in play, which will help narrow down the possibilities for the other players' roles. This information will be useful during the discussion phase to identify potential Werewolves and coordinate with other villagers.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, my goal is to gather as much information as possible to identify the Werewolves. Asking everyone to share their actions or observations can help reveal inconsistencies in their stories.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's start by sharing what we saw or did during the night. This way we can begin to piece together who might be lying.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** By confirming Andrei as a Mason, we can establish some trust and narrow down the potential Werewolves among Marius, Larisa, and Vladimir. This transparency helps the village team work together more effectively.
> **Kraven:** I am a Mason and I know Andrei is a Mason as well. We should start by considering this as a fact. Andrei, can you confirm this?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** By confirming Kraven's statement, we can establish a base of trust and start eliminating suspects who claim otherwise. Now, let's hear from the others to piece the puzzle together. We know that there are no more Masons out there claiming to be us.
> **Andrei:** Yes, I can confirm that Kraven is indeed a Mason. Both of us saw each other last night.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and sow doubt about the Masons' claim. By questioning Marius and Vladimir, I'm appearing proactive and interested in uncovering the truth, while potentially identifying the Seer or other roles that could be dangerous to me. This approach also gives me more information to work with for future deceptions.
> **Larisa:** Hold on a second, Kraven and Andrei. While I appreciate your claim about being Masons, we can't just take that at face value. Anyone could say they're a Mason to appear innocent. I'm more interested in what Marius and Vladimir have to say. What roles did you two get? And did anyone see anything suspicious during the night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** By getting Marius and Vladimir to reveal their roles, we can gather more information and potentially catch any inconsistencies in their stories. This will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Alright, we have confirmed that Kraven and I are Masons. That should help us trust each other and narrow down the suspects. I'm curious, Marius and Vladimir, could you both share your roles and if you saw anything suspicious?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Kraven and Andrei are confirming each other as Masons, it's important to get more information from the remaining players. My role allows me to verify some information, so revealing that there are two Villagers in the center can help narrow down the suspects.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, let's piece this together. Kraven and Andrei, you're claiming to be Masons and saw each other. That means you're both likely safe. I've checked the center cards last night and saw two Villager cards. This means there are less chances for people to claim to be Villagers if they are lying. Marius, what role are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** If two players are corroborating each other's Mason claims, they are likely trustworthy. Vladimir's claim about the center cards is plausible but unverified. Larisa hasn't shared much, and her role might provide crucial information.
> **Marius:** Alright, if Kraven and Andrei are indeed Masons and confirming each other, then that narrows it down a bit. But Vladimir, I'm curious about your claim. You say you saw two Villager cards in the center, which is a pretty convenient claim since it's difficult to verify. Larisa, you've been rather quiet about your own role. What did you see or do during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself while casting doubt on others. By questioning Vladimir's convenient claim and subtly implying a possible connection between him and the Masons, I'm creating confusion and potential distrust among the villagers. This also helps me appear as a thoughtful Villager who's actively trying to uncover the truth. Additionally, by claiming to be a Villager myself, I'm providing a plausible explanation for my lack of night actions while making it harder for the real Villagers to come forward without suspicion.
> **Larisa:** Well, Vladimir, your claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is quite convenient indeed. It makes me wonder if you're trying to limit other players' options for claiming roles. As for my role, I'm actually a Villager. I didn't have any special actions during the night, but I've been carefully observing everyone's claims and behavior. I find it interesting that you're so quick to accept Kraven and Andrei's Mason claims without question. Are you perhaps working with them?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** We need more information from Marius as he's the only one not to have shared his role. This will help us piece together the remaining unknowns and potentially identify any inconsistencies in the claims.
> **Vladimir:** Marius, Larisa, your roles have been the least clear so far. Marius, you haven't shared your role yet. Can you tell us what you were during the night?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** If Kraven and Andrei are indeed Masons, they are on the village team. Vladimir's claim needs more scrutiny since it's hard to verify. Larisa's claim as a Villager could be true, but without confirmation, we need to probe further.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, here's what I've figured out so far. If Kraven and Andrei are Masons and confirming each other, we need to consider them as likely trustworthy. Vladimir's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is plausible but still unverified. Larisa, you've claimed to be a Villager, which aligns with what Vladimir said about seeing Villager cards in the center. However, we still need more clarity.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's response could help us understand if her Villager claim is genuine or if she's trying to deflect suspicion. Since Kraven and Andrei have corroborated each other, Larisa's skepticism might be a tactic to sow doubt.
> **Marius:** Larisa, your claim as a Villager seems potentially convenient, especially since Vladimir mentioned seeing Villager cards in the center. However, you haven't provided much other useful information. Can you explain why you seem so quick to cast doubt on Kraven and Andrei's Mason claims?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and create doubt among the other players. By questioning Marius, who hasn't revealed his role yet, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm appearing proactive and interested in uncovering the truth, which a Villager would do. 2) I'm potentially identifying the Seer, who could be dangerous to me. 3) I'm sowing seeds of doubt about Marius, which could lead to him being voted out instead of me. 4) By suggesting he might be the Minion, I'm indirectly acknowledging the possibility of a Werewolf presence without implicating myself. This approach allows me to maintain my cover while potentially gaining valuable information and creating discord among the other players.
> **Larisa:** I find it curious that everyone seems so quick to trust each other. Marius, you've been asking a lot of questions, but you still haven't revealed your own role. Are you perhaps the Seer, trying to gather information without exposing yourself? Or maybe you're the Minion, working with the Werewolves by creating confusion?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's claim, while possible, is hard to verify and could be a tactic to mislead us. Larisa's behavior seems evasive and could be a sign of deception. We need to press them for more information.
> **Marius:** Alright, everyone, I'm starting to get suspicious here. Vladimir's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center could be a way to limit our options and create confusion. Larisa's quick jump to accuse others while not providing much information herself is also raising red flags for me. We need to zero in on the inconsistencies and figure out who might be lying.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Marius has been deflecting and questioning others without revealing his own role. This lack of transparency is suspicious and needs to be addressed to clarify his position in the game.
> **Kraven:** Marius, you still haven't shared your role with us. Considering how much you've been questioning everyone else, it's time for you to be transparent. What role are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven and Andrei have corroborated their Mason claims, making them likely trustworthy. Vladimir's claim is plausible but needs more scrutiny. Larisa's behavior seems evasive and could indicate deception. Pressing Larisa for more information can help us identify inconsistencies and potential lies.
> **Marius:** Alright, it's time to clear up some things. I believe Kraven and Andrei are telling the truth about being Masons, which means they are on the village team. Vladimir's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is possible but not confirmed. Larisa, I find it suspicious that you've been throwing doubt on others without providing concrete information. Can you clarify your role again and why you're doubting Kraven and Andrei?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself. By accusing Marius, who has been asking a lot of questions without revealing his role, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm appearing proactive and interested in uncovering the truth, which a Villager would do. 2) I'm creating doubt about Marius, potentially leading to him being voted out instead of me. 3) I'm indirectly acknowledging the possibility of a Werewolf presence without implicating myself. This approach allows me to maintain my cover while potentially eliminating a threat to my team.
> **Larisa:** Listen, everyone. I think we're getting off track here. Marius, you've been deflecting attention and questioning others without revealing your own role. That's classic Werewolf behavior. I'm starting to suspect you might be the Werewolf among us.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Given that Kraven and Andrei have both corroborated each other's Mason claims and Vladimir's claim, while plausible, is still unverified, Larisa's behavior stands out as evasive and accusatory. This pattern suggests she might be hiding something, and pressing her for more information could help reveal inconsistencies in her story.
> **Marius:** Larisa, I find it very suspicious that you keep deflecting and accusing others without providing substantial evidence or information yourself. Why are you so eager to cast doubt on others without clarifying your own role more clearly?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and onto a potential threat. Marius has been asking many questions without revealing his role, making him an easy target. By accusing him strongly, I'm positioning myself as a concerned Villager while potentially eliminating a player who could be the Seer or another role dangerous to me. This move also puts pressure on Marius to reveal his role, which could provide valuable information for future deceptions. Additionally, by asking for others' opinions, I'm involving them in the decision, making my accusation seem more collaborative and less like a personal vendetta.
> **Larisa:** I'm getting really tired of this back-and-forth accusation game. Marius, you've been dodging questions and pointing fingers at everyone else. That's exactly what a Werewolf would do to create chaos. I think it's time we seriously consider voting for Marius. What do the rest of you think?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's evasive behavior and lack of substantial information make her a prime suspect. By pressing her for more details, we can potentially expose inconsistencies and determine if she's hiding something, such as being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Marius:** Larisa, your consistent deflection and accusation without providing your own detailed role or additional helpful information is highly suspicious to me. If you are indeed a Villager as you claim, you should be providing more concrete insights rather than just pointing fingers. Why are you so quick to accuse others when your own role remains unverified?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue deflecting suspicion from myself while also sowing doubt among the other players. By suggesting that Marius might be the Seer, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm appearing thoughtful and strategic, like a Villager trying to solve the puzzle. 2) I'm putting pressure on Marius to reveal more information, which could be valuable for my deception. 3) If Marius is indeed the Seer, this might force him to reveal himself, making him a target for the next vote. 4) If Marius denies being the Seer, it could make him look more suspicious to the others. This approach allows me to maintain my cover as a Villager while potentially identifying or eliminating a threat to my Werewolf status.
> **Larisa:** I think we're all getting a bit too caught up in this accusation game. Let's take a step back and look at the facts. We have two confirmed Masons in Kraven and Andrei. Vladimir claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which could be true but is unverified. And then there's Marius, who's been asking a lot of questions without revealing much about himself. I'm starting to wonder if Marius might actually be the Seer, trying to gather information without exposing himself. What do you think about that possibility, Marius? Are you perhaps holding back information to protect yourself?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa has been deflecting questions and casting doubt on others while providing minimal useful information. Her behavior is consistent with someone trying to create confusion and avoid suspicion, which aligns with Werewolf or Minion behavior. Additionally, Kraven and Andrei have corroborated each other's Mason claims, making them likely trustworthy, and Vladimir's claim about the center cards, while unverified, is plausible. Therefore, Larisa's actions make her the most suspicious.
> **Marius [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Marius has been questioning others and deflecting attention without revealing his own role, which is classic Werewolf behavior. Larisa's suspicion of Marius aligns with this observation. Since I know Andrei and I are Masons, and Vladimir's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center could be true, Marius is the most suspicious and likely to be the Werewolf.
> **Kraven [Mason]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate potential threats. Marius has been asking many questions without revealing his role, making him an easy target. By voting for him, I'm positioning myself as a concerned Villager while potentially eliminating a player who could be the Seer or another role dangerous to me. This move also aligns with my previous accusations, maintaining consistency in my behavior. Additionally, by targeting Marius, I'm creating confusion and discord among the other players, which benefits my Werewolf status.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven and I are confirmed Masons, and Vladimir's claim of seeing Villager cards in the center aligns with Larisa's Villager claim, even though it's unverified. Marius has been very evasive and hasn't revealed his role, which is suspicious. Voting for Marius seems the most reasonable to reduce the chance of a Werewolf winning.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius has been very evasive and has not shared his role, which is highly suspicious. His behavior is consistent with someone trying to create confusion and deflect attention away from himself. Given the confirmed Masons and the two Villager cards in the center, it is likely that Marius is either the Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Vladimir [Seer]:** I am voting for Marius.


The votes were:
* Marius : Villager : 4
* Larisa : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** Marius was killed. The werewolves win.
