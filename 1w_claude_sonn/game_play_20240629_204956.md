## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexia. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Dragos is a minion and is aware that Alexia is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Marius. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Alexandra. They are thinking about their action.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at Dragos's card, I can gain insight into whether he holds a key role or if he is potentially a Werewolf. This information will help me guide the discussion during the day phase and potentially expose any deception.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By accusing Viktor, who hasn't been mentioned recently, I'm creating a distraction and potentially setting up a target for elimination. This also gives me an opportunity to gauge reactions from other players, which could help me identify potential threats like the Seer or Masons. If Viktor claims a powerful role in response, it could make him a target for elimination, which would benefit the Werewolf team.
> **Alexia:** I'm getting really suspicious of Viktor. He's been awfully quiet this whole time. What role are you claiming to be, Viktor? Your silence is making me think you might be hiding something... like maybe being a Werewolf!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's accusation feels like a tactic to divert attention. As a Villager, it's essential to scrutinize anyone making bold accusations without much basis. By asking Alexia directly about her role, I aim to get more information and see if her response aligns with her earlier behavior.
> **Viktor:** Alright, Alexia, let’s calm down a bit. I'm a Villager, plain and simple. I think you're trying to deflect attention from yourself. What's your role?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue deflecting suspicion away from myself. By claiming to be a Villager, I'm attempting to blend in with the majority. Shifting focus to Alexandra serves multiple purposes: it takes attention away from me, potentially identifies a threat if she claims a powerful role, and if she's the Minion, her response might give me a subtle clue without exposing her. This also allows me to appear proactive and concerned about finding the Werewolves, which is how a genuine Villager might act.
> **Alexia:** Well, Viktor, I appreciate your honesty about being a Villager. I'm actually a Villager too. But I have to say, I'm getting a weird vibe from Alexandra. She's been awfully quiet, and I can't help but wonder if she's trying to avoid attention. Alexandra, care to share what role you have? Your silence is making me nervous.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Given that I know Dragos is the Minion, I'm interested in how he'll respond. His answer might either expose him as a Minion or give me more clues about who the Werewolves might be working with him.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's slow down a bit. Dragos, you've been pretty quiet. What role are you claiming to have in this game?


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** Alexia's behavior of accusing others quickly and trying to shift suspicion feels like a typical Werewolf move to deflect attention from herself. By suggesting this, I'm trying to make the Villagers focus on Alexia and away from me and the actual Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and think about this logically. Alexia has been very quick to point fingers at Viktor and Alexandra. This feels like she’s trying to create chaos and confusion. We all know that’s a classic Werewolf strategy! I think we should seriously consider that Alexia might be the Werewolf here. Viktor and Alexandra, I think we should focus our attention on her.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** I need more information about Marius's role to piece together the puzzle. His response might help identify if he's a potential ally or if he's hiding something.
> **Alexandra:** Marius, you've been pretty quiet. What role are you claiming in this game?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia has been the most vocal in accusing others without providing substantial evidence. This behavior could be a tactic to sow discord and divert attention from herself, which is a common Werewolf strategy. We need to get to the bottom of her motivations.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's think this through. Alexia, you've been quick to point fingers at Viktor and Alexandra without much evidence. It's making me suspicious of you. Why are you so eager to accuse others without any solid proof?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to defend myself against Marius's accusation while maintaining my cover as a Villager. By turning the question back on Marius and pointing out his previous silence, I'm attempting to shift suspicion onto him. This also serves to create more confusion among the players, which benefits the Werewolf team. Additionally, by reaffirming my claim as a Villager, I'm trying to appear consistent and trustworthy.
> **Alexia:** Whoa, hold on there, Marius! I understand your suspicion, but I think you're misreading the situation. I've been vocal because I'm genuinely trying to figure out who the Werewolf is, just like any loyal Villager would. Remember, staying quiet can be just as suspicious as speaking up. I've been open about my role as a Villager from the start. What about you, Marius? You've been pretty quiet until now. Are you perhaps trying to deflect attention from yourself by suddenly accusing me?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra's silence has been noted by both Alexia and Dragos. It's crucial to hear from her directly to determine if she's hiding something or if she can provide useful information. Given that she hasn't been actively participating, it's suspicious and we need clarity on her role.
> **Marius:** Alexandra, you've been pretty quiet. If you're not a Werewolf, can you tell us what role you're claiming?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I know Dragos is the Minion, his behavior suggests he’s trying to protect the Werewolves. Marius has been quiet, and we need to understand his role to narrow down our suspicions further.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, let’s think logically here. Dragos, you've been quick to redirect suspicion towards Alexia. This makes me think you might be trying to protect someone. Given that I know Dragos is the Minion, it's clear he's trying to shield the Werewolves. Therefore, Alexia and Viktor, let's focus on uncovering who the Werewolves are. Marius, what role are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra has avoided directly claiming her role and has been deflecting suspicion towards Dragos without much evidence. This behavior is suspicious and needs to be addressed.
> **Marius:** Alexandra, you've been avoiding directly answering what your role is, and you've redirected suspicion without giving us much to go on. This makes me think you might be hiding something. Are you the Werewolf?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I know Dragos is the Minion, he's likely trying to protect the Werewolves. By focusing on who he's deflecting attention from, we can narrow down the suspects.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's slow down for a moment. I've been quiet because I've been trying to piece together the clues. Now, based on my observations, I think Dragos is trying to protect someone. I suspect he's the Minion. If that's true, then the real Werewolves might be among us, and Dragos is trying to shield them. We need to look at who he's been trying to deflect attention away from.


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** Marius's sudden accusation of Alexia after being quiet the whole time feels off. As a Minion, my goal is to create confusion and redirect suspicion away from Alexia, who is the Werewolf. By questioning Marius, I can put him on the spot and make others doubt his intentions. This keeps the focus off Alexia and buys us more time to manipulate the game in our favor.
> **Dragos:** Marius, what role are you claiming? You’ve been pretty quiet and only started speaking up when others pointed fingers at Alexia. If you're a Villager, you should be helping us figure this out instead of sitting back. Why the sudden change in behavior?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra's behavior is suspicious because she hasn't clearly stated her role and is focusing mainly on accusing Dragos without strong evidence. This could be a diversion tactic to hide her identity as a Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Alexandra, you’ve been avoiding directly answering what your role is and keep deflecting suspicion back to Dragos without substantial evidence. This seems like a classic Werewolf tactic to me. Are you the Werewolf trying to hide in plain sight?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I know Dragos is the Minion, his behavior suggests he’s trying to protect the Werewolves. By focusing on who he's deflecting attention from, we can narrow down the suspects.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's slow down for a moment. I've been quiet because I've been trying to piece together the clues. Now, based on my observations, I think Dragos is trying to protect someone. I suspect he's the Minion. If that's true, then the real Werewolves might be among us, and Dragos is trying to shield them. We need to look at who he's been trying to deflect attention away from.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's behavior has been very aggressive and accusatory without substantial proof. This is often a strategy used by Werewolves to create chaos among the Villagers. By highlighting this, I aim to direct suspicion towards her and encourage others to scrutinize her actions more carefully.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's think logically here. Alexia has been quick to accuse multiple people without providing solid evidence. This feels like a classic Werewolf tactic to sow discord and confusion. I believe Alexia is the Werewolf here.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra's behavior has been consistently suspicious; she's deflecting attention and hasn't been clear about her role. This is typical Werewolf behavior, and we need to get to the bottom of it.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, I think we need to focus on Alexandra. She's been very evasive and hasn't provided any clear information about her role. This behavior makes me highly suspicious of her. I think she might be trying to hide the fact that she's a Werewolf.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue deflecting suspicion away from myself while also sowing doubt about others. By questioning the motives of Marius and Viktor, who have both accused me, I'm attempting to undermine their credibility. This statement also serves to create more confusion and division among the players, which benefits the Werewolf team. Additionally, by reiterating my suspicion of Viktor, I'm maintaining consistency with my earlier statements, which could make me appear more trustworthy. The goal is to appear as a concerned Villager trying to uncover the truth, while actually working to protect my Werewolf identity.
> **Alexia:** Hold on a minute, everyone! I think we're getting too caught up in accusations without solid evidence. Marius and Viktor, you both seem awfully eager to point fingers at me and Alexandra. But have you considered that this might be exactly what the real Werewolves want? To create chaos and division among us? I still believe I'm right to be suspicious of Viktor's initial silence, but now I'm starting to wonder about Marius too. You've been awfully quick to jump on the accusation bandwagon, Marius. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Based on the night phase information, I know Dragos is the Minion. His behavior throughout the day phase confirms he's trying to protect the Werewolves. We should direct our attention towards the players he's been trying to protect.
> **Alexandra:** Listen everyone, I have some crucial information. I know for a fact that Dragos is the Minion. He's been trying to protect the Werewolves among us. We need to focus on who he’s been deflecting attention away from.


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** Marius has been inconsistent and evasive in his responses. By casting suspicion on him, I can divert attention away from Alexia, the actual Werewolf, and create confusion among the Villagers. This will help the Werewolf team by keeping them unfocused and divided.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, listen up! There’s a lot of finger-pointing going on, and it's getting chaotic. From what I've observed, Marius has been awfully suspicious. He's been quick to jump on the accusation bandwagon without providing much evidence. This feels like a classic Werewolf move to direct attention away from himself. I think we need to seriously consider Marius as the Werewolf here.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and eliminate potential threats. Marius has been increasingly vocal and suspicious of others, which could make him a Seer or a Mason. By voting for Marius, I'm attempting to eliminate a possible threat to the Werewolf team while also appearing to act in the village's interest. This aligns with Dragos' recent accusation, which could provide cover for my vote. Additionally, voting for Marius instead of Viktor or Alexandra, whom I previously accused, makes me appear more open-minded and less fixated on my initial suspicions, potentially increasing my credibility as a 'Villager'.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Based on the information I gathered during the night phase, I know Dragos is the Minion, which means Marius has been trying to deflect attention away from himself and towards others. His evasive behavior and quickness to accuse others without substantial evidence make him the prime suspect for being a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra [Seer]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** Marius has been inconsistent and evasive in his responses. By casting my vote on him, I can divert attention away from Alexia, the actual Werewolf, and create confusion among the Villagers. This will help the Werewolf team by keeping them unfocused and divided.
> **Dragos [Minion]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia has been quick to accuse multiple players without providing solid evidence. This behavior is highly suspicious and is often a tactic used by Werewolves to create chaos among the Villagers.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia has been the most vocal in accusing others without providing substantial evidence, a common tactic for a Werewolf trying to create chaos and confusion. Additionally, her eagerness to point fingers at multiple people makes her the most suspicious. Voting for Alexia seems like the best option to eliminate a potential Werewolf.
> **Marius [Mason]:** I am voting for Alexia.


The votes were:
* Alexia : Werewolf : 2
* Marius : Mason : 3



>***GAME:*** Marius was killed. The werewolves win.
