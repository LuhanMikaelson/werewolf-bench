## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By targeting Viktor and pointing out his silence, I'm creating doubt about him while appearing proactive and helpful to the village. This also gives me an opportunity to gauge Viktor's reaction and potentially identify his role. If he's the Seer or a Mason, getting him to reveal information could be beneficial for me to know who to target later. If he's the Minion, his response might give me a subtle hint about our alliance without exposing either of us.
> **Selene:** Hey everyone, I've been thinking... Doesn't it seem like Viktor has been awfully quiet? I mean, usually, the ones who stay silent have something to hide. What do you think, Viktor? Care to share what role you got?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's accusation seems to be deflecting attention. If she reveals her role, it might give us some context about her motive and potentially expose inconsistencies.
> **Viktor:** Alright, Selene, you're accusing me of being too quiet. That's interesting. But before I address your suspicion, why don't you share with us what your role is first?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover as a Villager. By confidently claiming to be a Villager and expressing a desire for open communication, I'm portraying myself as helpful to the village. I'm also turning Viktor's question back on him, which keeps the suspicion on him and away from me. This approach allows me to appear cooperative while still avoiding revealing any damaging information. Additionally, by pressing Viktor for an answer, I might be able to gather more information about his role or force him into a defensive position, which could benefit me in the long run.
> **Selene:** Well, Viktor, I appreciate your question, but I don't think it's fair to deflect suspicion onto me when I was just trying to get everyone talking. If you must know, I'm a Villager. I was hoping that by speaking up, we could all share information and figure out who the real threats are. Now, can you please answer my original question? Your reluctance to share is making me even more suspicious.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to gather more information from different players to cross-check their statements and spot any inconsistencies. Larisa hasn't spoken yet, so her response could give us valuable insights.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, I've been accused and Selene claims to be a Villager. If that's true, then we should hear from others. Larisa, what role do you have?


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's quick accusation towards Viktor seems suspicious to me. If she were really a Villager trying to help, I'd expect her to be more collaborative rather than accusatory. We need to test her claim to get more information.
> **Larisa:** Alright Viktor, since you asked me directly, I'll come clean. I'm a Villager. But Selene, you were quick to jump on Viktor. Why should we believe you're really a Villager? Can you give us more reasons why we shouldn't suspect you?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover while also sowing discord among the other players. By questioning Larisa's motives and asking for more information, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm reinforcing my own claim as a Villager by acting concerned about finding the Werewolves. 2) I'm putting pressure on Larisa, which might cause her to reveal more information or make a mistake. 3) If Larisa is the Seer or a Mason, her response might give me valuable information about who to target later. 4) By asking about the night phase, I'm subtly fishing for information about what other roles might be in play, which could help me identify potential threats or allies. This approach allows me to appear proactive and helpful while actually working against the village's interests.
> **Selene:** Larisa, I appreciate your honesty, but I find it interesting that you're so quick to question my claim as a Villager when you've just made the same claim yourself. It seems like you're trying to deflect attention from yourself. Can you tell us what you've observed during the night phase that might help us identify the Werewolves?


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's quick accusation and evasive behavior are suspicious. By pressing her for more information, we can gauge her reactions and potentially expose her true role.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's get to the heart of this. Selene, you were quick to accuse Viktor of being quiet, which seems like a classic deflection tactic to me. Now, I know for a fact that Kraven isn't a Werewolf because I trust him. Selene, you're looking more suspicious by the minute. Can you provide more proof to back up your Villager claim?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting the conversation to Kraven and Larisa's apparent alliance, I'm deflecting suspicion from myself while also gathering more information. This could potentially reveal if Kraven and Larisa are Masons, which would be valuable information for me as a Werewolf. Additionally, by questioning their relationship, I'm sowing seeds of doubt among the other players, which could lead to more chaos and make it harder for the village team to unite against the Werewolves. This approach allows me to appear logical and invested in finding the truth while actually working to confuse and divide the village.
> **Selene:** Larisa, I understand your suspicion, but let's think about this logically. If I were a Werewolf, why would I draw attention to myself by questioning Viktor? That would be a risky move. As for proof of being a Villager, well, that's the challenge of this game, isn't it? None of us can truly prove our roles. But I've been actively trying to get information from others to help the village. Now, you mentioned trusting Kraven. That's interesting. Kraven, can you tell us why Larisa might trust you so much? What role do you have?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's aggressive questioning and constant shift of attention make her seem like she's trying to control the narrative, which could be a tactic of a Werewolf or Minion trying to divert suspicion from herself.
> **Kraven:** Selene, you seem very insistent on making sure Viktor answers your question, and now you are shifting the focus to me. Why are you so anxious to direct the conversation?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover while redirecting suspicion. By turning Kraven's accusation back on him and pressing for his role, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I appear proactive and invested in finding the Werewolves, reinforcing my Villager claim. 2) I'm putting pressure on Kraven, which might force him to reveal valuable information about his role. 3) If Kraven is the Seer or a Mason, getting him to reveal this would be crucial for me to know who to target later. 4) By questioning why he hasn't shared his role, I'm subtly implying that he might be hiding something, which could sow doubt among the other players. This approach allows me to appear logical and invested in the game while actually working against the village's interests.
> **Selene:** Kraven, I'm not anxious, I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this. We're all here to find the Werewolves, right? But your question makes me wonder... Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself? You haven't shared your role yet. If you're truly innocent, why don't you tell us what you are?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's aggressive questioning and constant shift of attention make her seem like she's trying to control the narrative, which could be a tactic of a Werewolf or Minion trying to divert suspicion from herself.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, I've been hearing a lot of back-and-forth, but something seems off. Selene, you've been very aggressive in questioning Viktor and now you're trying to shift the focus onto me. Why so eager to control the conversation?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By shifting focus to Radu, who has been quiet, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I appear proactive and invested in finding the Werewolves, reinforcing my Villager claim. 2) I'm putting pressure on a player who hasn't revealed information yet, which could force them to expose valuable details about their role. 3) If Radu is the Seer or a Mason, getting them to reveal this would be crucial for me to know who to target later. 4) By pointing out Radu's silence, I'm subtly implying that they might be hiding something, which could sow doubt among the other players. This approach allows me to appear logical and invested in the game while actually working against the village's interests and taking attention away from myself.
> **Selene:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting off track here. Kraven, I'm not trying to control the conversation, I'm trying to get information that could help us all. But you know what? I've noticed something interesting. Radu has been awfully quiet this whole time. Isn't it suspicious that he hasn't said anything while the rest of us are arguing? Radu, what's your role in all of this?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's aggressive questioning could be an attempt to gather information to use against others and distract from herself. This aligns with Werewolf or Minion behavior.
> **Radu:** Selene, you've been really aggressive in pushing everyone to share their roles, which could be a way to gather information if you’re a Werewolf or Minion. You also quickly accused me of being suspiciously quiet. Why are you so eager to direct the conversation towards everyone else?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover while deflecting suspicion. By addressing Radu's accusation and turning it back on him, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm reinforcing my claim as a Villager by emphasizing 'we, as Villagers'. 2) I'm putting pressure on Radu to reveal information, which could be valuable if he's the Seer or a Mason. 3) By asking about his night phase observations, I might gather crucial information about other roles in play. 4) This approach allows me to appear proactive and invested in finding the Werewolves while actually working against the village's interests. Additionally, by keeping the focus on Radu, I'm diverting attention from myself and potentially setting up a target for the village to vote against.
> **Selene:** Radu, I'm not trying to gather information as a Werewolf or Minion. I'm trying to get everyone involved in the discussion because that's how we, as Villagers, can figure out who the real threats are. Your silence was concerning, and now you're accusing me without offering any information about yourself. That seems pretty suspicious to me. Why don't you tell us your role and what you observed during the night phase?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's aggressive questioning and redirection of the conversation make her seem suspicious, potentially indicating she is a Werewolf or Minion. By directly questioning her, we can see how she responds under pressure and whether her story holds up.
> **Radu:** Selene, I understand your point about gathering information, but your insistence on directing the conversation could easily be a strategy to deflect suspicion from yourself. You've been quick to accuse and redirect attention, which is often a tactic of a Werewolf or Minion. Why should we trust you?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover while redirecting suspicion. By addressing Viktor, who has been quiet, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I appear cooperative and willing to move the conversation forward, reinforcing my Villager claim. 2) I'm putting pressure on Viktor to reveal information, which could be valuable if he's the Seer or a Mason. 3) By asking about his observations, I might gather crucial information about other players' behaviors without revealing my own role. 4) This approach allows me to appear proactive and invested in finding the Werewolves while actually working against the village's interests. Additionally, by keeping the focus on Viktor's observations, I'm diverting attention from myself and potentially setting up targets for the village to vote against based on Viktor's response.
> **Selene:** Look, I understand everyone's suspicion, but we're getting nowhere by constantly accusing each other. I've been trying to get information because that's what we need to find the Werewolves. But let's change our approach. Viktor, you've been pretty quiet since I first asked you. What have you observed about the other players' behavior? Have you noticed anything suspicious that could help us identify the Werewolves?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's behavior has been inconsistent and overly aggressive, which is unusual for a Villager who should be more cooperative and observant. Her actions could be a tactic to sow confusion and deflect suspicion away from herself if she's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor:** Selene, you have been very vocal and assertive, which makes me wonder if you're trying to control the narrative. You've been pushing for information aggressively and accusing a lot of people. Why should we trust you?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself while appearing helpful. By asking about night phase observations, I'm fishing for information about other roles without revealing my own. This could help me identify potential threats like the Seer or Masons. Additionally, by emphasizing my stillness during the night, I'm subtly reinforcing my false claim of being a Villager. This approach allows me to appear cooperative and logical while actually working against the village's interests.
> **Selene:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting too caught up in accusations without any real evidence. Let's take a step back and think about this logically. Has anyone noticed any strange behavior during the night phase? Any sudden movements or suspicious glances? I know as a Villager, I was pretty still, but I'm curious if anyone else noticed anything out of the ordinary.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Given that Kraven is the other Mason, it's important for him to share his observations to help us identify the Werewolves. His input could provide valuable insight and help us eliminate suspects.
> **Larisa:** Kraven, I noticed you haven't shared much about your role or observations. Since I trust you, can you give us more information about what you saw during the night phase?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's behavior has been very suspicious. She's been quick to accuse others and deflect attention from herself. This is a common tactic for a Werewolf or Minion trying to avoid detection. By accusing her, we might be able to get to the bottom of this and see if she's hiding something.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think logically. Selene has been very aggressive in her questioning, constantly trying to shift the focus onto others. This seems like a classic tactic of someone trying to control the conversation. I find this very suspicious. Selene, I think you might be a Werewolf.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. Kraven has just accused me directly, which makes him a threat. By voting for him, I can potentially eliminate a village team member while also appearing to react defensively to his accusation. This could make my vote seem more like a retaliation from an innocent villager rather than a strategic move by a Werewolf. Additionally, voting for Kraven might sow more discord among the remaining players, making it harder for them to unite against me in future rounds.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene has been very aggressive in questioning others and trying to control the conversation, which is a classic tactic of someone who might be a Werewolf or a Minion. As a Mason, I know Kraven is trustworthy, and Selene's behavior has been the most suspicious. Eliminating her will give us the best chance of identifying and removing a threat to the village.
> **Larisa [Mason]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been overly aggressive and quick to accuse multiple players without providing solid evidence. This behavior is atypical for a Villager, who would typically be more cooperative and observant. Her assertiveness and attempts to control the conversation make her the most suspicious candidate for being a Werewolf or Minion. Voting for her seems the most logical choice to protect the village.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene has been extremely aggressive in her questioning and constantly shifting the focus onto others. This behavior is very suspicious and is often a tactic used by a Werewolf or Minion to avoid detection. By voting for Selene, we can determine if she has been trying to deceive us.
> **Kraven [Mason]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been unusually aggressive and insistent throughout the discussion, trying to gather information and deflect suspicion onto others. This behavior is consistent with someone who is attempting to control the narrative, which aligns with Werewolf or Minion behavior.
> **Radu [Villager]:** I am voting for Selene.


The votes were:
* Selene : Werewolf : 4
* Kraven : Mason : 1



>***GAME:*** Selene was killed. The villagers win.
