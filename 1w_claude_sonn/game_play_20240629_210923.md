## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Andrei. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Larisa is a minion and is aware that Andrei is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dracula. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Marius. They are thinking about their action.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards gives me a broader understanding of the roles that are not in play, which helps in deducing the roles of the other players and identifying any potential Werewolves or the Minion.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** Starting with night actions can help us gather information. By targeting Lucian, I can gauge his response to see if he gives away any useful information, and it may also help deflect suspicion from Andrei, the werewolf.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's get down to business. I think the best way to start is by having everyone share what they did last night. I'll start. I was a Villager, so I didn't wake up during the night phase. What about you, Lucian? Did you have any night actions?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Since I am a Villager, I need to start gathering information from others who may have had night actions. Asking Dracula directly might give us some insights or help us catch any inconsistencies in his story.
> **Lucian:** I didn't have any night actions either, Larisa. I was just a Villager. But I'm curious, Dracula, did you happen to see anything unusual last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I can confirm part of the information about the center cards, which helps narrow down the possibilities. Asking Andrei to share his information could give us more clues about the roles in play.
> **Dracula:** I woke up last night as a Mason, and I didn't see another Mason, so the other Mason card must be in the center. This means we can trust that two out of three center cards are a Mason and a Villager. Now, Andrei, what did you see or do last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By questioning Dracula's claim of being a Mason, I'm attempting to cast doubt on his statement and potentially sow discord among the group. This could help me blend in as a Villager while also potentially identifying the real Mason or Seer based on their reactions. Additionally, by targeting someone who's already revealed information, I'm making myself appear more proactive and less suspicious.
> **Andrei:** Well, I have to say, I'm a bit confused by what's going on. As a Villager, I didn't wake up during the night, but I'm getting a strange feeling about you, Dracula. You claim to be a Mason, but how do we know you're not just trying to throw us off? It seems convenient that the other Mason card is supposedly in the center. What if you're actually a Werewolf trying to gain our trust?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's accusation seems unfounded and possibly aimed at diverting attention. By questioning Marius, we can gather more information about the remaining roles and narrow down the suspects.
> **Dracula:** Andrei, your suspicion of me feels misplaced. As a Mason, I know one of the center cards is a Mason, and I'm willing to bet that you're trying to deflect attention away from yourself. If you're a Villager, you should be helping us figure out who the Werewolves are, not casting doubt without any solid evidence. Lucian and Larisa both claimed to be Villagers, which leaves you and Marius. Marius, what did you do last night?


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** By confirming that the Villager and Mason cards are in the center, I can lend credibility to Dracula's claim and focus suspicion on Larisa and Lucian, since one of them must be lying.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, I think Dracula's claim about being a Mason is actually consistent with my own observations. Last night, I used my Seer ability to look at two of the center cards, and I can confirm that a Villager and a Mason are indeed in the center. This means Dracula is likely telling the truth. Now, Larisa and Lucian both claimed to be Villagers, but we know there can only be one Villager left among us. One of them might not be telling the truth. Andrei, what's your take on this? Do you think both Larisa and Lucian are being honest?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian and Larisa both claimed to be Villagers, but given the confirmed center cards, only one of them can be telling the truth. By focusing on their claims, we can narrow down the suspects and identify the Werewolf or Minion among us.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, we need to focus on narrowing down the suspects. Marius has confirmed my claim about the Mason and Villager being in the center, so we know that two center cards are trustworthy. That leaves us with the possibility that either Larisa or Lucian is lying about being a Villager. Since there can only be one Villager among us, one of them must be a Werewolf or the Minion.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to narrow down the suspects, and one of Larisa or Lucian must be lying since there can't be two Villagers left. By putting Larisa on the spot, we can get more information and see if she slips up.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's think about this carefully. If Dracula and I are both telling the truth, then we know there can only be one Villager among us. Larisa and Lucian, one of you must be lying. Larisa, why should we believe your claim over Lucian's?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By focusing on Lucian, I can deflect suspicion away from Andrei, who is the Werewolf. If Lucian struggles to justify his claim, it will cast doubt on him and could potentially get him voted out instead of Andrei.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's break this down further. Marius claims to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, which would back up Dracula's claim of being a Mason. But we still have the issue of there being only one Villager left. Since Lucian and I both claimed to be Villagers, let's put some pressure on Lucian to explain why we should believe his claim.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Marius has confirmed Dracula's claim, it means one of us who claimed to be a Villager is lying. I want to put pressure on Larisa to explain her reasoning, as it might reveal inconsistencies or help us identify the Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** Alright, Marius has confirmed seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center, which backs up Dracula's claim of being a Mason. But that means there can only be one Villager among us, since Larisa and I both claimed to be Villagers. Larisa, why should we believe your claim over mine?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** My goal is to cast suspicion on Lucian and away from Andrei, the Werewolf. By questioning Lucian's claim and suggesting he might be the Minion or the Werewolf himself, I can deflect attention away from Andrei and make it more likely that Lucian will be the one voted out.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's think this through carefully. We've heard some solid claims, but I can't shake the feeling that someone isn't being honest here. Dracula, you've been pretty vocal about being a Mason, and Marius has backed you up by saying he saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. This all seems to add up, but we still have the issue of only one Villager being left among us. Lucian, earlier you claimed to be a Villager, but things aren't quite adding up. If there can only be one Villager among us, it could mean you're trying to hide something. Maybe you're the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf? Or worse, maybe you're the Werewolf yourself? We need to get to the bottom of this.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and Lucian, who's currently under suspicion. By redirecting focus to myself, I appear more innocent and proactive. This also gives me a chance to gauge other players' reactions and potentially identify the Seer or Mason based on how they respond to my question. Additionally, by bringing attention back to my earlier accusation of Dracula, I'm subtly reinforcing doubt about his claim, which could help sow discord among the villagers.
> **Andrei:** Hold on a minute, Larisa. I think you're jumping to conclusions too quickly about Lucian. We shouldn't forget that Andrei has been awfully quiet since his initial accusation against Dracula. Isn't it convenient that he's letting us all argue while he sits back? Maybe he's the one we should be questioning. Andrei, can you explain why you were so quick to accuse Dracula earlier, and why you've been so silent since then?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and create doubt about the trustworthy players. By apologizing for my earlier behavior, I'm attempting to appear more genuine. Targeting Marius, who claimed to be the Seer, serves two purposes: it casts doubt on his powerful role, and it indirectly questions Dracula's credibility again. This could create confusion among the villagers and make it harder for them to identify the real threats. Additionally, by asking Marius to defend his claim, I'm putting him in a difficult position where any answer he gives could be used to further suspicion against him.
> **Andrei:** Wait a minute, everyone. I realize I might have come across as suspicious earlier, but I was just trying to be cautious. I apologize if I seemed too quiet afterwards; I was carefully considering everyone's claims. Now, I'm really concerned about Marius. He claims to be the Seer, but isn't it convenient that his 'vision' perfectly aligns with Dracula's story? What if they're working together? Marius, can you explain why we should trust your Seer claim when it so neatly backs up Dracula?


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei's behavior has been suspicious, shifting focus without giving solid reasoning. Pressing him to explain his thoughts might reveal inconsistencies or help us gather more information.
> **Marius:** Andrei, you've been casting doubt on others without offering much yourself. You first suspected Dracula, and now you're questioning my Seer claim. If you're truly a Villager, who do you think the Werewolves are and why?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to shift suspicion away from myself and Lucian, who's been under scrutiny. By apologizing for my earlier behavior, I'm trying to appear more reasonable and trustworthy. Targeting Larisa serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me and Lucian, potentially identifies a strong village player for future voting, and creates more confusion among the group. By questioning her aggressive behavior, I'm subtly implying that she might be the Werewolf, which could make the villagers doubt her and each other. This move also allows me to gauge reactions and potentially identify other key roles based on how they respond to this new accusation.
> **Andrei:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting off track here. Marius, I apologize for questioning your Seer claim earlier. I was just being cautious. But now, I'm really worried about Larisa. She's been awfully quick to accuse others, especially Lucian, without providing any solid evidence. Isn't it possible that she's the Werewolf trying to create chaos and turn us against each other? Larisa, can you explain why you've been so aggressive in your accusations?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By focusing on Lucian, I can deflect suspicion away from Andrei, who is the Werewolf. If Lucian struggles to justify his claim, it will cast doubt on him and could potentially get him voted out instead of Andrei.
> **Larisa:** Lucian, I find it really suspicious that you claimed to be a Villager when there's clearly some discrepancies in the number of Villagers. Can you explain why you think your claim should be trusted over mine?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa has been quick to accuse others, especially me, without providing solid evidence. We need to get clarity on her actions to determine if she's trying to deflect suspicion away from herself.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, it's clear we have some conflicting narratives here. But considering what we've heard so far, I think Larisa's aggressive accusations and quick defenses are highly suspicious. If there's only one Villager left among us, we need to focus on the inconsistencies. Larisa, can you explain why you've been so forceful in your accusations, and why we should believe you're not the Minion or a Werewolf?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Lucian, I aim to create a strong case against him and deflect suspicion from Andrei, who is the Werewolf. This will help preserve our chances of winning by getting the villagers to focus on Lucian instead.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's not lose sight of what we've uncovered so far. Dracula's claim of being a Mason has been backed up by Marius, who claims to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. We've established that there can only be one Villager left among us, which means someone is definitely lying. Lucian, you've avoided giving a clear reason why we should trust your claim over mine. Given the conflicting claims and the evidence presented, I'm convinced that Lucian is the most suspicious among us. If we want to root out the Werewolf, we need to focus on the inconsistencies. I firmly believe Lucian is the one we should vote out.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius's claim as the Seer is crucial to verify Dracula's Mason claim. If Marius provides more specific details about the center cards, it will help us confirm their roles and identify the potential Werewolf among Larisa and Andrei.
> **Lucian:** Marius, you claimed to be the Seer and backed up Dracula's claim about the center cards. If you're truly the Seer, can you give us more details about the exact cards you saw in the center?


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to see if Larisa's reasoning holds up under scrutiny, as her aggressive behavior might indicate she's trying to deflect attention away from herself.
> **Marius:** Larisa, you've been very quick to accuse Lucian and have been quite defensive when questioned. Can you explain why we should trust you and why you think Lucian is a Werewolf?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** Based on the discussions, there are conflicting claims about the Villager roles. Dracula's claim of being a Mason is supported by Marius, who claims to be the Seer and verified two center cards. This leaves only one possible Villager among us. Lucian and I both claimed to be Villagers, but Lucian hasn't provided a strong defense for his claim. By voting for Lucian, I aim to deflect suspicion away from Andrei, who is the Werewolf, and help my team (the Werewolf team) win.
> **Larisa [Minion]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Given the discussions, both Marius and I can confirm the presence of a Mason and a Villager in the center cards. This means only one Villager is among us. Larisa and Lucian both claimed to be Villagers, but since there can only be one, one of them must be lying. Larisa has been consistent in her reasoning, while Lucian's responses have been more defensive and less substantiated. Therefore, I suspect Lucian might be the Werewolf or Minion trying to create confusion.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Throughout the discussion, Larisa has been the most aggressive in her accusations, particularly against Lucian, without providing solid evidence. This behavior seems like an attempt to create chaos and deflect attention away from herself. Given that there can only be one Villager among us and the inconsistencies in her claims, I believe she is the most likely to be a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Marius [Seer]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate villagers without raising suspicion. Larisa has been the most aggressive in her accusations, particularly against Lucian. By voting for her, I'm supporting Lucian (who might be the Minion or another Werewolf) and potentially eliminating a strong village player. This also aligns with my earlier questioning of Larisa's behavior, making my vote seem consistent and less suspicious. Additionally, voting for Larisa instead of Lucian (who's under more suspicion) makes me appear more objective and less likely to be a Werewolf myself.
> **Andrei [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa has been very aggressive in her accusations and has not provided solid evidence for her claims. With Marius confirming the presence of a Villager and a Mason in the center, it means one of us who claimed to be a Villager is lying. Her actions have been highly suspicious, making her the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf or Minion trying to deflect attention.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


The votes were:
* Larisa : Minion : 3
* Lucian : Villager : 2



>***GAME:*** Larisa was killed. The werewolves win.
