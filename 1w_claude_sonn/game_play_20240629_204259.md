## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** It's important to start casting suspicion on someone who isn't a Werewolf to protect Dracula. Lucian hasn't said much, which makes it easier to target him without any concrete evidence.
> **Stefan:** I think it's pretty suspicious that Lucian has been so quiet. I've seen games where the Werewolf tries to lay low and avoid drawing attention to themselves. Lucian, what do you have to say about your role?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to establish my innocence and leverage my knowledge as a Mason to gather information. Since Stefan questioned me first, addressing his concern directly can help reduce suspicion on me and shift the focus towards finding the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Stefan, I understand why you might think I'm being quiet, but I'm a Mason. I didn't see another Mason last night, so I know one of the Mason cards is in the center. We need to figure out who the Werewolves are quickly. Has anyone else seen anything suspicious?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting the spotlight on Emil, I can deflect suspicion away from Dracula and sow confusion among the villagers. If Emil hesitates or provides a weak answer, it will help build the case against him, ensuring Dracula remains safe.
> **Stefan:** Emil, you’ve been awfully quiet too. We need all the information we can get. What role did you have last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather more information to cross-check Lucian's claim and see if Ileana can provide additional insights or clues. By questioning Ileana, I can also potentially expose inconsistencies or confirm her role, which helps in identifying the Werewolves.
> **Emil:** I was actually waiting to see what everyone else had to say first, Stefan. But since you're asking, I'll share my thoughts. If Lucian is telling the truth about being a Mason, that means we have one Mason in the center and one on the table. Ileana, what did you see or do last night?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** If Lucian is telling the truth, we need to gather more information from others to confirm or deny his claim. Dracula's role could give us more insight into the situation.
> **Ileana:** Lucian, you claim to be a Mason and saw no other Mason. That could be true, but I need more information. Dracula, you haven't said much. What role did you have last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. Ileana hasn't revealed her role yet, making her an easy target. By accusing her, I can appear proactive and concerned about finding the Werewolves, while actually misdirecting the group. This also puts pressure on Ileana to reveal information, which could help me identify potential threats like the Seer or Masons.
> **Dracula:** Well, well, well... I've been observing quietly, and I think I've figured something out. Ileana, you've been awfully evasive about your role. Care to explain why you deflected Emil's question earlier? It seems to me like you might be hiding something... perhaps a pair of furry ears and a tail?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's sudden accusation feels like a deflection tactic to draw suspicion away from himself. By asking him directly about his role, we can gauge his reaction and see if he contradicts himself or gives us any valuable information.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, that's a bold accusation. I haven't been evasive at all. In fact, I just wanted to gather more information about everyone else's roles before making any claims. But since you're so eager to point fingers, what exactly did you do last night? What role did you have?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I'm presenting myself as a non-threatening, honest player. This helps divert suspicion away from me. I'm also maintaining pressure on Ileana, as she hasn't revealed her role yet. By doing this, I'm hoping to force her to reveal information that could be useful in identifying potential threats. Additionally, I'm subtly casting doubt on Stefan's earlier accusation of Lucian, which could create discord among the villagers and make it harder for them to identify the real werewolf (me).
> **Dracula:** Ileana, I understand your desire to gather information, but avoiding direct questions only breeds suspicion. As for my role, I'm a simple Villager trying to uncover the truth. I didn't have any special actions last night, but I've been carefully observing everyone's behavior. Stefan's quick accusation of Lucian and now your reluctance to share information are raising red flags for me. Can you please tell us your role and what you did last night?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's aggressive accusation without substantial evidence feels like a diversion tactic. If he were genuinely trying to find the Werewolves, he'd be more interested in gathering information rather than making baseless accusations.
> **Ileana:** Alright, everyone. We need to get to the bottom of this quickly. Here's what I'm thinking: Lucian's claim as a Mason seems credible for now. But Dracula's sudden accusation towards me is raising my suspicions. He might be trying to deflect attention away from himself by casting doubt on me. Does anyone else find Dracula's behavior odd?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** By questioning Stefan, I aim to gather more information about his role and cross-check his story against the others. This will help us identify inconsistencies and narrow down the potential Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, we need to zero in on the Werewolves quickly. From what I've heard so far, Lucian's claim as a Mason seems solid. Stefan, you were quick to accuse Lucian, but you didn't share much about yourself. Can you tell us your role from last night?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing attention towards Dracula and questioning his motives, I'm trying to shift suspicion away from Dracula and make it seem like I'm genuinely trying to uncover the truth. This helps to protect Dracula while also sowing confusion among the villagers. If Dracula can convincingly defend himself, it will further solidify his position and deflect suspicion from both of us.
> **Stefan:** Alright, everyone, here's what I'm thinking. Dracula's sudden accusation towards Ileana seems really suspicious to me. Usually, when people start throwing accusations without solid evidence, it's a tactic to deflect attention from themselves. Dracula, if you really are a Villager like you claim, why did you jump to accusing Ileana so quickly?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself while also sowing doubt about other players. By calling out Stefan's quick accusations and pointing out inconsistencies in his behavior, I'm attempting to undermine his credibility. This could potentially make the group less likely to trust his future statements, which might be harmful to me. Additionally, by suggesting that everyone clearly state their roles, I'm setting up a situation where I can potentially identify the Seer or other dangerous roles. Lastly, by directly questioning Stefan, I'm putting him on the defensive, which could make him appear more suspicious to the others.
> **Dracula:** Hold on a moment, Stefan. I think you're jumping to conclusions a bit too quickly here. My concern about Ileana wasn't unfounded - she was avoiding direct questions, which naturally raises suspicion in a game like this. But let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. We have Lucian claiming to be a Mason, which could be true, but we haven't confirmed it. Emil has been asking questions but not revealing much about himself. And you, Stefan, were quick to accuse Lucian earlier and now you're pointing fingers at me. Don't you think that's a bit hypocritical? I think we need to hear from everyone clearly about their roles and what they did last night. Why don't we start with you, Stefan? What exactly was your role and what did you do during the night phase?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Emil directly, I can shift focus away from Dracula and myself, while potentially catching Emil off guard. This tactic keeps Dracula safe and sows confusion among the villagers, increasing the chances of a villager being accused.
> **Stefan:** Okay, everyone, let's take a step back and analyze what we have so far. Dracula’s quick accusation of Ileana seemed a bit rushed and could be a tactic to deflect attention. However, Ileana has also been somewhat vague in her responses. We need to get to the bottom of who the Werewolves are, and that means we need clear and direct answers from everyone. Lucian claims to be a Mason, and if true, it helps us narrow things down. Emil, I noticed you were quick to question others but haven't shared much about yourself. What role did you have last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** We need clarity, and Ileana has been deflecting questions. If she is indeed hiding something, it will become apparent with a direct question. This will help us narrow down the suspects.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone, we're getting nowhere with all these accusations flying around. Let's take a step back and recap what we know so far. Lucian claimed to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, suggesting one is in the center. Ileana, you've been asked directly by multiple players, and you've been evading. Please tell us clearly, what was your role last night and what did you do?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's behavior seems like a deflection tactic, and Stefan's lack of information is also suspicious. By pressing them both, we might reveal inconsistencies that could help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Lucian, your claim as a Mason seems credible so far. But I'm finding Dracula's sudden and aggressive accusations really odd. Dracula, can you explain why you were so quick to point fingers at me without any solid evidence? And Stefan, you still haven't shared much about your own role. What exactly did you do last night?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's behavior seems suspicious. By directly questioning him, I want to see if he can provide a consistent explanation or if his story falls apart. This will help us narrow down the suspects.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, your sudden and aggressive accusations towards me feel like a deflection tactic. Why were you so quick to point fingers without any solid evidence?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting the focus to Stefan, I'm attempting to deflect suspicion away from myself. Stefan has been active in accusing others but hasn't revealed much about his own role, making him a good target. This also puts pressure on Stefan to reveal information, which could help me identify potential threats. Additionally, by acknowledging Ileana's point but turning it back to her earlier behavior, I'm trying to maintain a balanced and reasonable appearance, which is crucial for my survival as a Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Ileana, I understand your suspicion, but let's not forget that you were the one avoiding direct questions earlier. My concern wasn't unfounded. However, I agree that we need more information from everyone. Stefan, you've been quick to accuse others, but you've shared very little about your own role. Can you please tell us what you did last night?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** I need to keep the spotlight away from Dracula and maintain suspicion on Ileana. By pushing her to reveal her role, it creates an opportunity for confusion and potential slip-ups that can divert attention from Dracula and myself.
> **Stefan:** Ileana, you're still avoiding direct questions and I'm finding it really suspicious. You haven't given us any clear information about your role. If you're really a Villager, you need to speak up now and share what you did last night.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan has been quick to accuse others without providing any information about his own role. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate that he's trying to hide something. By directly questioning him, we can see if his story holds up or if there are inconsistencies that might reveal him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Ileana:** Stefan, your accusations are inconsistent and you're deflecting questions. What was your role last night?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By pushing Ileana to reveal her role and actions, we can create confusion and potential slip-ups that keep the spotlight off Dracula. This helps protect Dracula and increases the chances of a villager being accused.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, let’s focus for a moment. We need to think logically about what we’ve heard so far. Lucian claims to be a Mason and didn’t see another Mason, which is consistent with one being in the center. Emil has been questioning others but hasn’t shared much about himself. Ileana has been vague, and Dracula’s aggressive accusations seem like a deflection. If I had to guess, I’d say our best bet might be to focus on Ileana. She hasn’t given us any clear information, and her evasiveness is really suspicious. Ileana, what exactly did you do last night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** Throughout the discussion, Ileana has been evasive and avoided answering direct questions about her role, which raises strong suspicions. By focusing on her, I aim to deflect attention away from Dracula, who I know is a Werewolf. This strategy helps protect the Werewolf team and increases the chances of eliminating a Villager, aiding in a Werewolf victory.
> **Stefan [Minion]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana has been evasive and vague in her responses throughout the day phase. This behavior is suspicious and consistent with someone trying to hide their true role. Additionally, Dracula and Stefan have both raised valid concerns about her deflecting questions and not providing clear information. Given the information we have, voting for Ileana seems like the best move to identify a potential Werewolf.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's aggressive accusations without solid evidence seem like a deflection tactic. Additionally, his responses have been inconsistent. Voting for Dracula might help us uncover if he's hiding a Werewolf role.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and eliminate potential threats. Ileana has been consistently evasive about her role, which makes her an easy target. By voting for her, I'm aligning myself with Stefan's suspicions, which could help build trust with other players. Additionally, eliminating Ileana could potentially remove a village-aligned role, bringing me closer to victory. This vote also maintains my facade of being a concerned Villager trying to uncover the Werewolves.
> **Dracula [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know one Mason card is in the center, which aligns with my claim. Throughout the discussion, Ileana has been evasive and hasn't clearly stated her role or actions, which raises suspicion. This behavior is consistent with a Werewolf trying to deflect attention from themselves. To maximize the chances of eliminating a Werewolf, my vote goes to Ileana.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Ileana.


The votes were:
* Ileana : Villager : 4
* Dracula : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** Ileana was killed. The werewolves win.
