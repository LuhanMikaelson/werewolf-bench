There is one seer in play, Kraven. They are thinking about their action.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards helps to narrow down the possibilities of what roles are in play. This information can be crucial in identifying false claims or confirming true ones during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Mason

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. By targeting Stefan and pointing out his lack of participation, I'm creating suspicion around him while also appearing engaged and helpful to the village. This move also gives me an opportunity to gauge Stefan's reaction and potentially identify if he's the Minion or another valuable role to the village team. If he responds defensively or vaguely, it could further incriminate him in the eyes of other players.
> **Cristina:** Hey everyone, I'm really concerned about Stefan. He's been awfully quiet and hasn't contributed much to the discussion. That's exactly what a Werewolf would do to avoid suspicion. What do you think, Stefan? Care to explain yourself?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's sudden accusation could be a deflection tactic. It's important to gather more information from the other players to see if there are inconsistencies in their claims.
> **Stefan:** Cristina, I understand your concern, but pointing fingers without evidence can be dangerous. I'm just a humble Villager trying to piece things together. Let's hear from Kraven. Kraven, what role do you claim to have?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing this information, we can narrow down the possible roles. Since the Minion and one Mason card are in the center, anyone claiming to be those roles is lying. This helps us focus our attention on identifying the Werewolves and ensuring we don't mistakenly accuse our fellow Villagers.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, listen up. I have some crucial information to share. Last night, I used my ability and checked two cards in the center. I can confirm that the Minion and one of the Masons are in the center, which means those roles are not in play.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Stefan has defended himself as just a humble Villager, I want to hear from Dracula next to see if he has anything to hide. This could help us narrow down the suspects further.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, you've been very quiet as well, which is not typical for you. What role do you claim to have?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center, so Kraven's claim feels like an attempt to mislead us. This raises suspicion on him potentially being a Minion or a Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, your claim about the Minion and Mason being in the center is interesting, but it contradicts what I know. I can confirm that the other Mason card is indeed in the center. I think you're trying to deceive us. Are you the Minion or perhaps a Werewolf?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's claim about the other Mason card being in the center contradicts my information as the Seer. This raises suspicion and needs to be addressed to narrow down potential Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, that's quite an interesting claim you have there. However, I know for a fact that one of the Mason cards is in the center, because I saw it myself. So, if you're claiming the same, then something doesn't add up. Are you trying to deflect suspicion from yourself? What role do you really have?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** If Kraven is lying about his role and the center cards, it raises the possibility that he is working against the village team. By challenging his claim and encouraging others to share their information, I aim to expose his deception and gather more evidence to identify the true Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, your claim about seeing a Mason and Minion in the center is highly suspicious. I know for a fact that the Mason card is in the center because I am the only Mason. If you're lying about this, then you might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves. Can anyone else provide information about the center cards or their roles to clarify this?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** With Dracula's claim contradicting my information, it's essential to gather more insights from other players. Vladimir's response might help us piece together the puzzle and potentially identify inconsistencies or confirm roles.
> **Kraven:** Vladimir, you've been quiet so far. What role do you claim to have and what information can you share to help us find the Werewolves?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** There's a direct conflict between Kraven and Dracula's statements about the center cards. Clarifying this can help us narrow down who is lying, which may reveal a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone, let's calm down and think this through step by step. Both Kraven and Dracula are making bold claims about the center cards. I think one of them might be lying. Dracula, if you truly saw the Mason card in the center, what was the other card you saw?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Vladimir has been quiet and hasn't disclosed any useful information yet, pressing him might reveal more contradictions or confirmations that can help us identify the Werewolves. By putting him on the spot, we can either catch him in a lie or get valuable information to guide our next steps.
> **Dracula:** Vladimir, the fact that you haven't shared any information so far is quite suspicious. If you're really trying to help the village, you should tell us what you know about the center cards or your role.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** The conflicting claims about the Mason card in the center are crucial. One of them is likely lying, and catching that person could lead us to uncovering the Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and think this through logically. Kraven and Dracula are both adamant about seeing a Mason card in the center, but their statements conflict. If Dracula is indeed the Mason, then Kraven must be lying, which makes him highly suspicious. On the other hand, if Kraven is telling the truth, then Dracula is trying to deceive us. We need more information to clarify this.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more clarity on where everyone stands. Vladimir has been quiet and has only pointed out the conflict without contributing much. If he's hiding something, it could be crucial to uncovering the truth.
> **Stefan:** Vladimir, your logic about Kraven and Dracula's conflicting statements is valid, but you still haven't shared your own role or any useful information. What role do you claim to have?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to clarify the conflicting statements about the center cards. If Dracula can provide a consistent and convincing answer, it might help us determine if Kraven or Dracula is lying.
> **Vladimir:** Dracula, if you claim to be the Mason and saw the Mason card in the center, what was the other card you saw?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir has been very quiet and hasn't shared any concrete information. Pressing him might reveal more contradictions or confirmations that can help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Vladimir, you still haven't given us any useful information. If you're really trying to help the village, you need to tell us your role and what you know about the center cards.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** If Kraven and Dracula are both claiming to see a Mason card in the center, the second card that Kraven saw could help us determine who is lying. This is crucial to figuring out who might be the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Kraven, your information conflicts with Dracula's. Can you clarify what the second card you saw in the center was?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** My role as the Seer allows me to view two cards in the center, and I saw the Minion and Mason there. Dracula's conflicting statement raises a red flag and suggests deception on his part.
> **Kraven:** Alright, everyone, listen up. I have substantial evidence to support my claim. I am the Seer, and I saw both the Minion and one of the Mason cards in the center. Dracula's claim about seeing the Mason in the center is false. This means Dracula is likely a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Stefan has been deflecting and not providing any useful information. This raises suspicion that he might be hiding something. Pressing him for his role might reveal contradictions or confirmations that can help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Stefan, you've been deflecting and not providing any concrete information. If you're truly a Villager, you should have no problem telling us what you know. What role do you claim to have?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's consistency in his story can help us determine if he's telling the truth as a Mason. His role as the Mason should give him a clear understanding of the center cards, which we can cross-check with Kraven's Seer claim.
> **Stefan:** Dracula, your claim about being the only Mason and seeing the Mason card in the center contradicts Kraven's statement. If you are truly a Mason, what card did you see alongside the Mason card in the center?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir has been avoiding giving concrete answers or sharing any useful information, which makes his behavior highly suspicious. Pressing him further might reveal inconsistencies or force him to reveal his true role, helping us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Vladimir, you're being very evasive and not providing any useful information. If you truly want to help the village, you need to come clean about your role and what you know about the center cards.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven and Dracula have conflicting statements. One of them is likely lying, and we need to uncover who it is to identify the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, we need to pay close attention here. If Kraven is claiming to be the Seer and claims to have seen the Minion and a Mason card in the center, while Dracula claims to have seen a Mason card, something is off. We need to figure out who is lying.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and eliminate potential threats. Kraven's claim to be the Seer is dangerous for me, as the Seer can potentially expose my true identity. By voting for Kraven, I'm hoping to eliminate a powerful role on the village team while also appearing to support Dracula's contradictory claim. This move might also create more confusion and distrust among the remaining players, which benefits my position as a Werewolf.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I saw the Minion and a Mason card in the center. Dracula's claim about seeing a Mason card in the center is false and suggests he is either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves.
> **Kraven [Seer]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** I believe Dracula's claim of being the Mason and seeing the Mason card in the center is more consistent. Kraven's claim of being the Seer and seeing the Minion and Mason in the center conflicts with Dracula's information. Additionally, Kraven was the second one to make a claim about the center cards, which could be an attempt to deflect suspicion. Therefore, I suspect Kraven might be the Minion or a Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Stefan [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know that the other Mason card is in the center, which contradicts Kraven's claim. This strongly suggests that Kraven is lying to mislead us. Given the conflicting information, Kraven is most likely either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** There is a clear conflict between Kraven and Dracula's statements regarding the center cards. Kraven's claim of being the Seer and seeing both the Minion and a Mason card in the center seems more consistent and detailed. Dracula has been evasive and hasn't provided sufficient evidence for his claims. Based on the information available, it seems more likely that Dracula is lying, possibly because he is a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Vladimir [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Kraven : Seer : 3
* Dracula : Mason : 2



>***GAME:*** Kraven was killed. The werewolves win.
