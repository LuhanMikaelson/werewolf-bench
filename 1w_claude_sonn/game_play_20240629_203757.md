## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Viktor. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Emil is a minion and is aware that Viktor is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Lucian. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Alexandra. They are thinking about their action.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me a better understanding of the roles that are not in play, which can help me deduce the roles the other players are likely to have and make my statements more credible during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing what I saw in the center, I’m reducing the possible roles in play and encouraging others to share their information, which will help us figure out who the Werewolves might be.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, here’s what I know: I looked at two of the center cards last night, and both of them were Villagers. That means we have fewer Villagers in play among us, and it also gives us a better chance to identify the Werewolves and Minion. So, let's start by hearing from everyone about what they did or saw last night.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra's information suggests fewer Villagers in play, which means we need to quickly identify the Werewolves. Getting input from each player will help us cross-check stories and find inconsistencies.
> **Lucian:** Well, if Alexandra saw two Villager cards in the center, that means there's only one Villager among us and potentially more Werewolves. That's pretty important. Viktor, what did you see or do last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By claiming uncertainty about my role and suggesting I might be a Villager, I'm trying to blend in. I'm also attempting to cast doubt on Alexandra's claim and Lucian's quick deduction, which could help sow confusion. By directly questioning Lucian, I'm putting him on the spot and potentially making him look suspicious, which could take attention away from me.
> **Viktor:** Well, I can tell you that I didn't see any Werewolves last night. In fact, I didn't see much of anything. I think I might be a Villager, but with all these roles flying around, it's hard to be certain. What concerns me is that if there are two Villager cards in the center, as Alexandra claims, that means there's a higher chance of Werewolves among us. Lucian, you seem awfully quick to point fingers. What exactly was your role last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** We need more information to identify inconsistencies and find the Werewolves. Andrei hasn't spoken yet, so it's crucial to get his input.
> **Lucian:** Alright, Viktor, if you're saying you might be a Villager, that means there should only be one Villager among us according to Alexandra. But we still need to hear from Andrei and Emil to cross-check everything. Andrei, what did you do or see last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more information from everyone. Emil hasn't spoken yet, and his information could be crucial in confirming or contradicting what Alexandra and others have said.
> **Andrei:** Alright, I think we need to clarify some things. Alexandra, you said you saw two Villager cards in the center, but we haven't heard from Emil yet. Emil, what did you do or see last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming to be a Mason and not finding the other Mason, I can support Alexandra's claim and add credibility to our reasoning. This also helps in subtly deflecting suspicion from Viktor, while putting some pressure on Lucian to reveal his role or potentially slip up.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, here's what I know: last night, I saw that I was a Mason. I looked for the other Mason, but I didn't find anyone. This means the other Mason card must be in the center. This aligns with Alexandra's claim that there are two Villager cards in the center. So, it's very likely that the roles we need to worry about are among the remaining cards with us. We need to be cautious and figure out who's lying. Lucian, what exactly did you see or do last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's unclear statements and uncertainty could suggest he's trying to avoid suspicion. It's crucial to push him for more details to uncover any inconsistencies.
> **Lucian:** Alright, Emil, you claim to be a Mason and didn't find the other Mason, which matches my own experience since I am the other Mason. This means we know for certain that the Mason card is in the center, aligning with Alexandra's information about the Villager cards. However, Viktor's vagueness about his role feels suspicious. Viktor, you didn't see any Werewolves and you're unsure if you're a Villager? That sounds like you're trying to avoid giving concrete information. I think Viktor might be hiding something.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on the information that's leading the group towards the truth. By questioning Alexandra's claim about the center cards, I'm trying to undermine the foundation of the group's deductions. Bringing suspicion to Lucian and Emil's corroborating stories also serves to create more confusion. By directing my statement at Alexandra, I'm putting pressure on her to defend her claim, which could make her look more suspicious. This strategy aims to divert attention from myself and create a more chaotic environment where it's harder for the village team to identify the real Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** Hold on a second, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in Alexandra's claim about the center cards. Remember, we can't actually verify what she saw. For all we know, she could be the Werewolf trying to mislead us. Lucian and Emil, your Mason claims conveniently back each other up, but that doesn't mean you're not working together as Werewolves. We need to consider all possibilities here.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei has been redirecting attention without providing any solid information about his own role. Given the uncertainty and the claims made so far, it's important to get specific details from him to cross-check everyone's stories and possibly identify any inconsistencies.
> **Alexandra:** Andrei, you seem to be avoiding giving any concrete information about your role. Can you tell us exactly what you did or saw last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's vagueness is concerning. If he's not giving us clear information, it could mean he's hiding something important, possibly indicating he's a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Andrei:** I think we need to focus on Viktor here. He's been very vague about his role, which makes me suspicious. Viktor, can you give us a more detailed account of what you did or saw last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and create confusion. By suggesting I might be the Seer, I'm trying to explain my vagueness while also contradicting Alexandra's claim, which could make her look suspicious. Mentioning memory issues adds a layer of plausible deniability. Directing attention to Andrei, who has been quiet, serves to shift focus away from me and potentially create a new target for suspicion.
> **Viktor:** Look, I understand the suspicion, but I can assure you all that I'm not a Werewolf. I'm just as confused as everyone else here. What I can say is that I didn't see any other players during the night, which rules out me being a Werewolf or a Mason. I'm starting to think I might be the Seer, actually. I remember looking at a card in the center, but I can't recall what it was. Maybe the stress of the game is affecting my memory. What I do know is that we need to be careful about jumping to conclusions. Andrei, you've been awfully quiet. What's your take on all of this?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's inconsistent statements and late claim to be the Seer seem like he's trying to cover up his true role. It's important to verify his information to see if it aligns with what we've heard so far.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, I find your sudden claim to be the Seer very suspicious. You're only saying this after a lot of information has already been shared, and your earlier vagueness doesn't align with the Seer's role. If you really are the Seer, can you tell us exactly which card you looked at in the center and what it was?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue deflecting suspicion while also sowing doubt about other players. By claiming to have seen a Villager card in the center, I'm attempting to align my story with Alexandra's, which might make me seem more trustworthy. However, I'm also subtly casting doubt on Alexandra by questioning how we can both be the Seer. This serves two purposes: it maintains my claim of possibly being the Seer, and it introduces the idea that Alexandra might be lying, potentially making her a target. By directing this to Andrei, I'm also trying to engage him and potentially shift some focus onto him, as he's been relatively quiet.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, I understand your suspicion, but I think you're misinterpreting my earlier statements. I was trying to be cautious and not jump to conclusions about my role too quickly. As for the card I looked at in the center, it was a Villager card. This actually aligns with what Alexandra said about two Villager cards being in the center. But here's the thing - if Alexandra is telling the truth about being the Seer, then who am I? This makes me wonder if Alexandra might be the Werewolf trying to pose as the Seer. What do you think about that possibility?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's delayed claim to be the Seer and his earlier vagueness make him seem suspicious. If he's covering up his true role, it might indicate he's a Werewolf or the Minion. We need to press him for more consistent information.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, your sudden claim to be the Seer doesn't sit right with me. If you really are the Seer, why did you wait until now to say it? And why were you so vague earlier? Can you explain that?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By turning the tables on Andrei and questioning his lack of information sharing, I'm attempting to shift the focus of suspicion onto him. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me, potentially makes Andrei look suspicious, and might cause confusion among the other players. Additionally, by challenging Andrei to reveal his role, I'm putting him in a difficult position - if he's a Villager or another non-special role, he won't have much to say, which could make him look more suspicious. If he claims a special role, it might contradict someone else's claim, creating more chaos. This strategy aims to create doubt and division among the other players, making it harder for them to identify me as the Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** Hey, wait a minute! Andrei, you're awfully quick to accuse me, but you've been suspiciously quiet this whole time. If you're so concerned about the Seer, why don't you tell us what your role is? For all we know, you could be the Werewolf trying to deflect attention onto me!


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to challenge Lucian's quick accusations and see if there's any inconsistency in his logic. If Lucian is pushing too hard against Viktor, it might indicate that he's trying to deflect attention from himself or another ally.
> **Andrei:** Lucian, you claim to be the other Mason, which lines up with Emil's claim. If that's true, then neither of you could have seen any Werewolves. Why are you so quick to accuse Viktor instead of considering that he might be telling the truth about being confused?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been inconsistent and vague about his role, which raises suspicion. First, he said he might be a Villager, then later claimed to be the Seer. This inconsistency and his hesitation strongly suggest he's hiding something, potentially being a Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** Viktor, your story has changed multiple times, and now you're claiming to be the Seer after already being vague about your role earlier. This doesn't add up. I think you're trying to deflect attention away from yourself. Everyone, I believe Viktor might be a Werewolf.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By targeting Andrei, who has been relatively quiet, I'm attempting to shift focus onto him. This serves multiple purposes: it takes attention away from me, potentially makes Andrei look suspicious, and might cause confusion among the other players. Additionally, by directly questioning Andrei about his role, I'm putting him in a difficult position. If he claims a special role, it might contradict someone else's claim, creating more chaos. If he claims to be a Villager, it might align too conveniently with the information we have, making him look suspicious. This strategy aims to create doubt and division among the other players, making it harder for them to identify me as the Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** I think we're all getting a bit too caught up in accusations here. Let's take a step back and look at the facts. Alexandra claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, Emil and Lucian both claim to be Masons, and I've shared what I remember about possibly being the Seer. But Andrei, you've been awfully quiet throughout this whole discussion. What exactly is your role, and what did you see or do last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's claim to be a Mason aligns with Lucian's, but we need to ensure their stories are consistent. This could help us eliminate suspects and confirm who is telling the truth.
> **Andrei:** Emil, I find it interesting that you and Lucian are both claiming to be Masons and backing each other up. If that's true, then neither of you could have seen any Werewolves. But Emil, can you clarify exactly what you did last night and any details you recall about the night phase?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei's lack of concrete information is raising suspicion. By putting pressure on him, we can potentially identify inconsistencies in his story or force him to reveal more about his role, which may help us deflect attention from Viktor and find another target for the vote.
> **Emil:** Andrei, you've been very quiet and haven't given us much information about what you did last night. Given the details we've heard so far, your silence is becoming increasingly suspicious. Can you tell us exactly what your role was and what you did during the night phase?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor's story has been inconsistent and he only claimed to be the Seer after a lot of information was already shared. His earlier vagueness and sudden change in claims make him the most suspicious person. Additionally, if Lucian and Emil are indeed the Masons, it further supports the idea that Viktor might be a Werewolf trying to deflect attention.
> **Alexandra [Seer]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's story has been inconsistent. He initially claimed to be unsure about being a Villager and later claimed to be the Seer only after a lot of information had been shared. This inconsistency and hesitation strongly suggest that he might be hiding something, potentially being a Werewolf. Given that Emil and I both claimed to be Masons and Alexandra's information about the center cards aligns with our statements, Viktor's behavior is the most suspicious to me.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and onto another player. Andrei has been the quietest throughout the game and hasn't provided much information about his role. By voting for him, I'm attempting to capitalize on the suspicion I've been trying to cast on him throughout the day phase. This vote aligns with my previous statements questioning Andrei's lack of input, which makes it seem like a natural progression of my thoughts rather than a sudden shift. Additionally, voting for Andrei instead of one of the more vocal players (like Alexandra or Lucian) might seem less aggressive and therefore less likely to draw suspicion back to me. This strategy aims to eliminate a potential threat while maintaining my cover as a possible Seer or confused Villager.
> **Viktor [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's story has changed multiple times throughout the discussion. His late claim to be the Seer after being vague earlier seems suspicious and inconsistent. Additionally, his claim aligns too conveniently with Alexandra's, who has been consistent from the beginning. Given that Lucian and Emil's Mason claims back each other up, Viktor appears to be the most likely suspect as either a Werewolf or Minion trying to deflect attention.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** Lucian is claiming to be the other Mason, but his role could easily be fabricated to back up my false Mason claim, which would make him a safe target. By voting for Lucian, I can create confusion and potentially save Viktor, the actual Werewolf, thus helping my team win.
> **Emil [Minion]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Mason : 1
* Viktor : Werewolf : 3
* Andrei : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Viktor was killed. The villagers win.
