## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Emil. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Alexia. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Marius. They are thinking about their action.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can potentially identify which roles are not in play and narrow down the possibilities for everyone's roles. This helps me deduce who might be lying during the day phase and can guide the villagers towards the correct target.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By casting doubt on Michael, I'm attempting to direct the group's attention elsewhere. This also gives me an opportunity to gauge other players' reactions and potentially identify the Seer or Masons based on their responses. Additionally, targeting a quiet player is a common strategy that villagers might use, so it helps me blend in with the group.
> **Emil:** Hey everyone, I'm feeling a bit uneasy about Michael. He's been awfully quiet, and I can't help but wonder if he's trying to avoid drawing attention to himself. What do you all think? Has anyone noticed anything suspicious about his behavior?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's comment about Michael being quiet could be a red herring, but it's important to see if anyone else has noticed any other behaviors or has additional information that could help us identify the Werewolves. By directing the conversation back to Emil, we keep the focus on gathering insights.
> **Alexia:** Emil, that's an interesting observation about Michael. I think it's worth noting if anyone else has any insight or suspicions about other players. We need to gather as much information as possible to make an informed decision.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue deflecting suspicion away from myself. By questioning Alexia's response, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm maintaining pressure on Michael, keeping him as a potential target. 2) I'm now casting doubt on Alexia, which could make her a new target and further divide the village team. 3) I'm presenting myself as observant and analytical, which is how a Villager or Seer might act. 4) By asking Alexia directly about potential information, I might be able to determine if she's the Seer or a Mason based on her response. This strategy allows me to appear helpful to the village while actually working against their interests.
> **Emil:** You know, I've been thinking about Alexia's response. It's interesting that she didn't really address my concerns about Michael, but instead tried to shift the focus to gathering information about everyone. That seems a bit evasive to me. Alexia, why didn't you share your thoughts on Michael? Do you have some information you're not telling us?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** By directing the question to Larisa, we can gather more information from another player who hasn't spoken much yet. This might help us see if she has any valuable insights or if she's trying to avoid drawing attention to herself like Michael.
> **Alexia:** Larisa, you've been rather quiet as well. Do you have any information or clues that might help us identify the Werewolves?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's observation about Michael's quietness could be valid, but Alexia's diversion seems unusual. If we can understand her reasoning, it might give us more clarity on who to suspect.
> **Larisa:** Alexia, I think Emil raises a good point about Michael's behavior. But I'm also curious why you didn't address it directly and instead shifted focus. Can you explain your reasoning?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** By addressing Emil's concern and then inviting Michael to share his thoughts, we can gather more information and potentially spot inconsistencies or clues that help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Alexia:** Emil, I understand your concerns, but I want to make sure we have all the facts before jumping to conclusions. If we focus too much on one person without hearing from others, we might miss important information. Michael, can you tell us more about your thoughts so far?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia has been avoiding direct answers and redirecting attention. This behavior could indicate she’s hiding something, and it's important to clarify her role.
> **Michael:** Alexia, your responses have been very methodical and you've been redirecting a lot. Are you trying to hide something? Can you tell us more about your role?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael has been quiet, and both Emil and Larisa have expressed suspicions. Directly asking him about his role might force him to reveal more, which will help us determine if he's a Werewolf or not.
> **Alexia:** Michael, everyone's pointing fingers at you and I'm curious—what's your role? Are you hiding something?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia has been methodically redirecting the conversation and avoiding direct answers. This behavior is suspicious and might indicate that she is hiding something important, potentially being on the Werewolf team.
> **Michael:** Alexia, your avoidance of direct answers and your tendency to shift focus are making me suspicious. Can you clarify your role for all of us?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael has been evasive and quiet, which has raised suspicions among the group. By directly asking him about his role, we can force him to provide more information and potentially catch him in a lie if he is indeed a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Alexia:** Michael, everyone's pointing fingers at you and I'm curious—what's your role? Are you hiding something?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's evasive behavior and repeated redirections are highly suspicious. By putting pressure on her, we might force her to reveal more information or slip up, which can help us determine if she's on the Werewolf team.
> **Michael:** Alexia, your responses have been very methodical and you've been redirecting a lot. Are you trying to hide something? Can you tell us more about your role?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael has been evasive and quiet, which are common signs of trying to avoid suspicion. Accusing him directly will force him to provide more information and help us deduce his true role.
> **Alexia:** Michael, you've been avoiding directly answering questions and both Emil and Larisa have brought this up. I'm starting to think you're hiding something. Are you a Werewolf?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa has been quiet and only engaging when prompted. It's important to get her perspective and see if she has any valuable information or insights about the Werewolves.
> **Michael:** Larisa, you've also been very quiet and only engaging when prompted. Can you tell us more about what you think? Do you have any information about who the Werewolves might be?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil initiated the scrutiny on Michael but hasn't continued to push for more information or strongly defend his stance. This sudden shift could mean he's trying to divert attention away from himself or a fellow Werewolf.
> **Larisa:** Emil, I find it interesting that you started off by calling out Michael, but now you've been relatively quiet since then. Why the sudden change in approach?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself while also casting doubt on others. By addressing Larisa's question and turning it back on her, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm defending myself against her accusation, which makes me appear more innocent. 2) I'm now casting suspicion on Larisa, potentially making her a new target. 3) I'm presenting myself as thoughtful and observant, which aligns with how a Villager might act. 4) By questioning Larisa's lack of contribution, I'm putting pressure on her to reveal more information, which could help me identify other roles. This strategy allows me to appear engaged and helpful to the village while actually working to protect my Werewolf identity.
> **Emil:** Well, Larisa, I appreciate your observation, but I think you're misinterpreting my actions. I've been actively listening and processing everyone's statements. Just because I'm not constantly interjecting doesn't mean I'm hiding anything. In fact, I find it interesting that you're now trying to shift focus onto me when you've barely contributed to the discussion. Are you perhaps trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's initial accusation and subsequent quietness could indicate he is trying to deflect suspicion away from himself. By asking Emil to clarify, we might uncover more about his intentions and potentially identify if he is hiding something.
> **Larisa:** Emil, you've been quite vocal about Michael being suspicious, but then you went quiet after initially pointing fingers. That seems off to me. Are you trying to distance yourself from the heat? Can you clarify your role for us?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Larisa's accusation and turning it back on her, I'm deflecting suspicion from myself while also casting doubt on her. This serves multiple purposes: 1) It makes me appear more innocent and thoughtful, like a Villager would be. 2) It puts pressure on Larisa, potentially making her a new target for suspicion. 3) It might force Larisa to reveal more information about her role, which could be useful for identifying potential threats to me as a Werewolf. 4) By questioning her lack of contribution, I'm presenting myself as engaged and observant, which aligns with how a Villager or Seer might act. This strategy allows me to appear helpful to the village while actually working to protect my Werewolf identity.
> **Emil:** Larisa, I appreciate your concern, but I think you're misinterpreting my actions. I've been carefully observing and processing everyone's statements. My initial suspicion of Michael was based on his silence, but as the conversation evolved, I've been trying to gather more information before jumping to conclusions. That's not being quiet, that's being strategic. Now, let me turn this around - you've barely contributed to the discussion until now. Why is that? Are you perhaps a Werewolf trying to lay low and then suddenly cast doubt on others when the heat is on?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's behavior of redirecting questions and focusing heavily on Michael is suspicious. I want to see if she'll provide a concrete answer that might either clear her or further raise doubts.
> **Larisa:** Alexia, this back-and-forth between you and Michael has raised a lot of suspicions and diverted attention away from Emil. Can you clearly state your role and why you're focusing so much on Michael?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa has been called out for being quiet and only speaking when directly addressed. This evasive behavior could indicate she's hiding something, potentially as a Werewolf or Minion. Addressing her directly might force her to reveal more information or catch her in a lie.
> **Alexia:** Larisa, your behavior is making me more suspicious. You've been quite evasive and only engaging when prompted. Can you clarify your role and why you've been so quiet?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been notably quiet throughout the discussion, which could be a tactic to avoid drawing attention. It's crucial to hear from him to gather more information and potentially identify any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, we've been going in circles with Michael and Alexia. I think it's time we hear from Marius. Marius, you've been very quiet and haven't contributed much to this discussion. Can you tell us your thoughts and if you have any suspicions?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager to increase my chances of winning. Michael has been the focus of suspicion from the beginning, and voting for him allows me to blend in with the villagers' suspicions while potentially eliminating a threat. Additionally, by voting for Michael, I'm maintaining consistency with my initial accusation, which makes me appear more genuine and less likely to be suspected as a Werewolf. This vote also keeps the attention away from me and other players who might be closer to discovering my true identity.
> **Emil [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa has been evasive and only engaged when directly prompted. This behavior is consistent with someone trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves, making her a prime suspect for being a Werewolf or Minion. By voting for her, we aim to eliminate a potential threat to the village team.
> **Alexia [Mason]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia has been methodically redirecting the conversation and avoiding direct answers. This behavior is highly suspicious and might indicate that she is on the Werewolf team. By voting for her, we might force her to reveal her card and gain valuable information.
> **Michael [Villager]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Based on the interactions, Michael has avoided directly answering questions and shifted focus multiple times. Given that I know the Minion and one Mason are in the center, Michael's behavior is most consistent with that of a Werewolf trying to avoid drawing attention. This makes him the most likely candidate for a Werewolf, and eliminating him will help the village team win.
> **Marius [Seer]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's initial accusation of Michael seemed strategic to draw attention away from himself, and his subsequent quietness after this initial push is suspicious. He may be trying to deflect suspicion. With the information at hand, Emil appears to be the most suspicious.
> **Larisa [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Emil : Werewolf : 1
* Alexia : Mason : 1
* Michael : Villager : 2
* Larisa : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The werewolves win.
