## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Cristina and Dragos. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Vladimir is a minion and is aware that both Cristina and Dragos are werewolves.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Lucian. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Michael. They are thinking about their action.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me insights into multiple potential roles that are not in play, making it easier to deduce which roles the other players might have. This is especially useful because the center cards are unknown to everyone, and revealing them can help me steer the discussion during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to gather information quickly, and since I know I'm the only Mason, I'm trying to see if Michael's response can help us narrow down the possibilities. If he hesitates or gives a suspicious answer, it might indicate that he's not being truthful.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, we need to start sorting out who might be the Werewolves here. I'll go first. Michael, what role did you have last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing some of the center cards, I can help narrow down our search for the Werewolves. Knowing Lucian's role will help verify our information and guide our next steps.
> **Michael:** Last night, I took a look at two of the center cards and saw that they were both Villager cards. This means we have two fewer roles to worry about being in play. So, Lucian, what role did you have?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's claim doesn't entirely add up because it leaves us with fewer roles to suspect. By asking Cristina, I want to gather more information and see if there are any inconsistencies among the players' stories.
> **Lucian:** I believe Michael might be lying about being the Seer. If he saw two Villager cards in the center, that means the other roles should be in play among us. But I have a strong feeling that we need to hear from the others first. Cristina, what role did you have last night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Dragos. By casting doubt on Michael's claim of being the Seer, I'm attempting to discredit the most powerful role that could expose us. This also serves to sow confusion among the Villagers, making it harder for them to identify the real threats. Additionally, by asking for others' opinions, I'm trying to appear collaborative and part of the village team, further masking my true identity.
> **Cristina:** Well, I hate to say this, but I'm starting to get a bit suspicious of Michael. Claiming to be the Seer right off the bat seems a bit too convenient, doesn't it? And if there are indeed two Villager cards in the center, that leaves very little room for error in our deductions. I'm not saying he's definitely a Werewolf, but it's worth considering. What do the rest of you think about this?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** If we can create some doubt around Lucian, it will help divert attention away from the werewolves and keep them safe. Additionally, it might make Lucian more defensive and potentially reveal more about his role or cause others to be suspicious of him.
> **Vladimir:** Hold on a second, everyone. I'm finding it quite interesting how quickly Lucian jumped to doubting Michael's claim without offering any information about his own role. Lucian, you've been pretty quiet about your own role. Are you trying to hide something?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir is deflecting attention away from Michael, who has already made a suspicious claim about the center cards. By questioning Vladimir directly, we can gather more information and see if there are any inconsistencies in his story.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, let's not get sidetracked. Vladimir, you seem pretty eager to cast doubt on me. What role did you have last night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing attention to Cristina, I can subtly protect her as a known Werewolf while also appearing to be genuinely interested in figuring out the roles in play. This helps in diverting suspicion away from the Werewolves and keeps the discussion focused on others.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone. We need to make sure we don't overlook any other potential roles. Cristina, you've been pretty quiet so far. Can you tell us what role you had last night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover as a Villager while also redirecting suspicion. By claiming to be a Villager, I'm presenting myself as a neutral party, which is less likely to draw immediate suspicion. Additionally, by questioning Vladimir's motives, I'm attempting to create doubt about his intentions and potentially draw attention away from myself and Dragos. This also serves to fragment the group's trust, making it harder for the actual Villagers to unite against the Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Vladimir, I appreciate your concern, but I think you're barking up the wrong tree here. I've been quiet because I've been trying to piece together all the information we have. To be honest, I'm a Villager. I know it's not the most exciting role, but it's crucial for us to work together to find the real threats. Now, I'm more interested in why you're so quick to deflect attention onto others. Are you perhaps trying to hide something yourself?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** We need to gather as much information as possible. By directing attention to Dragos, I can subtly divert any suspicion away from Cristina and possibly gather more clues about the roles in play. This helps us identify potential threats and maintain a balance in the discussion.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, I've been listening carefully and trying to piece together the puzzle. Michael, if you're truly the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center, then that leaves us with fewer roles to account for among the players here. But I must say, Cristina's claim of being a Villager feels a bit too safe and convenient. We haven't heard much from Dragos yet. Dragos, what role did you have last night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Cristina. By claiming to be a Villager, I align myself with Cristina's claim, making us both seem more credible. Questioning Lucian serves two purposes: it diverts attention away from me and potentially identifies a target for elimination. If Lucian turns out to be the Seer or a Mason, he would be a prime target for the Werewolves. Additionally, by expressing surprise at Vladimir's interest in my role, I subtly cast doubt on him as well, further muddying the waters.
> **Dragos:** I must say, I'm quite surprised by the turn this conversation has taken. Vladimir, your sudden interest in my role seems rather suspicious. Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself? As for my role, I'm a simple Villager, just like Cristina. But I find it interesting that no one has questioned Lucian's role yet. Lucian, you were quick to doubt Michael's claim as the Seer. What exactly is your role in all of this?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir has been deflecting and casting doubt on others without providing any substantial information about his own role. It's crucial we get him to reveal his role to narrow down our suspicions.
> **Lucian:** Alright, let's get serious here. Michael claimed to be the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center. Cristina and Dragos both claimed to be Villagers, which seems a bit too convenient. We need to be cautious of too many Villager claims. Vladimir, you still haven't answered what role you had last night. If you're hiding something, now's the time to come clean.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Dragos and Cristina while subtly questioning Lucian's motives, I can protect the werewolves and create confusion among the Villagers. This approach helps in diverting suspicion away from the actual werewolves and maintains a balanced discussion to find potential threats or villagers.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone, I've been paying close attention to all the claims so far. Lucian was quick to cast doubt on Michael's Seer claim without giving us much about his own role. Cristina's Villager claim seems safe, but she says she's trying to piece things together. Dragos also claims to be a Villager. Michael, if you truly are the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center, then it's possible someone here is lying. Given the limited roles in play, I find it hard to believe both Cristina and Dragos are Villagers. One of them is likely hiding something.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and Dragos. Vladimir has been asking a lot of questions and casting doubt on others, which could potentially lead to us being discovered. By accusing him of being the Minion, I'm attempting to discredit him while also introducing the possibility of a Minion in play, which could further confuse the Villagers. This move also positions me as someone who's actively trying to uncover deception, reinforcing my facade as a Villager. Additionally, if Vladimir is indeed the Minion, this accusation might make him more cautious about defending the Werewolves too openly.
> **Cristina:** I think we're getting off track here. Vladimir, you're raising a lot of suspicions about others, but you still haven't told us your role. That seems awfully convenient, doesn't it? Are you perhaps the Minion, trying to create chaos to protect the Werewolves?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing the question towards Lucian, I can keep the focus away from the actual Werewolves and maintain the confusion among the Villagers. This will bring Lucian under scrutiny and buy more time for the Werewolves to remain undetected.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, let's not get too carried away with pointing fingers without solid evidence. Lucian, you've been very vocal about doubting Michael's Seer claim, yet you haven't shared your own role with us. It's time for you to come clean. What role did you have last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir has been deflecting and casting doubt on others without providing any substantial information about his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and typical of someone who is trying to protect the Werewolves. By questioning him directly and forcefully, we can gather more information and see if there are any inconsistencies in his story.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, listen up! Based on everything we've heard so far, I'm highly suspicious of Vladimir. He's been deflecting attention and hasn't given us any concrete information about his own role. I think he's trying to protect someone. Vladimir, it's time to come clean. Are you the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Lucian, who has been vocal and casting suspicion, I can divert attention away from the actual Werewolves and keep the discussion focused on someone who has not yet revealed their role. This helps to maintain confusion among the Villagers and protect the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone, let's get serious here. If we're going to find the Werewolves, we need to be methodical and consider all possibilities. I know some of you might find my questioning method a bit forward, but we need to dig deep. Michael, you claimed to be the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center. That's a significant claim, but it leaves us with very few roles left. And I can't help but notice that Lucian has been very quick to doubt Michael without sharing his own role. Lucian, I'm finding your behavior increasingly suspicious.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's behavior has been suspicious from the start, and he hasn't provided any useful information about his role. If he can't justify his actions, he might be hiding something crucial.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, based on everything we've heard so far, I'm becoming more and more suspicious of Lucian. He was quick to doubt my claim as the Seer without giving us any solid information about his own role. I think it's time for him to come clean about his role. Lucian, you need to tell us what role you had last night.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's behavior has been highly suspicious and evasive. He keeps deflecting attention and hasn't provided any concrete information about his role. This is typical Minion behavior, trying to protect the Werewolves. By questioning him directly, we can gather more information and see if there are any inconsistencies in his story.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, I've been listening to all of you and piecing things together. Vladimir has been very evasive and hasn't given us any solid information about his own role. I think he's trying to protect the Werewolves. Vladimir, if you're hiding something, now's the time to come clean. Are you the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Lucian, who has been quick to accuse others and hasn't revealed his own role, I can create confusion and keep the focus away from the actual Werewolves, Cristina and Dragos. This helps to protect them and maintain the chaos needed for the Werewolves to stay hidden.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone, Lucian has been very vocal about casting doubt and hasn't provided a clear role himself. If he's so eager to accuse others without sharing his own role, it makes me think he's hiding something. Lucian, I'm calling you out—are you the Werewolf trying to deflect attention?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's evasive behavior and constant deflecting are typical signs of someone trying to protect the Werewolves. We need to press him and see if he slips up or reveals anything more concrete.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, I think we've heard enough from each other. The way Vladimir has been deflecting and not giving us any clear information about his role is highly suspicious. I believe Vladimir is either a Minion or a Werewolf, trying to protect the real threat. Let's not let him off the hook. Vladimir, are you the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's evasive behavior and constant deflection of attention without providing concrete information about his own role are highly suspicious. He fits the profile of either a Minion or a Werewolf trying to protect the real threat. By voting for him, we have a strong chance of eliminating a key player from the werewolf team.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** Lucian has been very vocal in casting doubt on others without providing clear information about his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious, and I believe he is either a Werewolf or trying to deflect attention from the actual Werewolves. Voting for Lucian will help protect the real Werewolves and maintain the confusion among the Villagers.
> **Vladimir [Minion]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Dragos. Vladimir has been asking a lot of questions and raising suspicions about others, which could potentially lead to our discovery. By voting for Vladimir, I'm reinforcing the narrative that he might be the Minion or a Werewolf, which aligns with the suspicions raised by others. This vote also helps maintain my cover as a Villager who's actively trying to eliminate threats. Additionally, eliminating Vladimir, who seems to be one of the more vocal and analytical players, could benefit our Werewolf team in the long run.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian has been quick to cast doubt on my claim as the Seer and has not provided any concrete information about his own role. His evasiveness and accusatory behavior make me suspect he could be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves. Therefore, I believe voting for Lucian gives us the best chance to eliminate a threat to the village.
> **Michael [Seer]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and Cristina. Lucian has been vocal in accusing others, particularly Vladimir, without revealing his own role. This makes him a good target for elimination. By voting for Lucian, I'm aligning with Michael's suspicion and Vladimir's accusation, which could help build trust with them. Additionally, eliminating Lucian could potentially remove a key village role (like Seer or Mason) if he's not actually a Werewolf, which would benefit our team. This vote also helps maintain my cover as a Villager, as it appears I'm trying to eliminate a potential threat to the village.
> **Dragos [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Mason : 3
* Vladimir : Minion : 2



>***GAME:*** Lucian was killed. The werewolves win.
