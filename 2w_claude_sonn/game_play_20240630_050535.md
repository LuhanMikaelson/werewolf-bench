## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Lucian and Cristina. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Alexandra. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Larisa. They are thinking about their action.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards gives me a broader understanding of the roles in the game, which can help in identifying whether any crucial roles like Werewolf or Minion are not in play. This information can be strategically useful to guide the village team during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** The Seer's information can be very valuable in identifying the Werewolves or clearing innocent players. As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center, so I want to gather as much information as possible to help the village team.
> **Alexandra:** I think it's important to start by finding out if we have a Seer among us. If there's a Seer, please come forward and tell us what you saw.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to provide this crucial information as early as possible to help the Villagers and other roles focus on identifying potential Werewolves. Knowing that the Minion is not in play allows us to concentrate on other clues.
> **Larisa:** I am the Seer, and I saw two center cards: Minion and Villager. This means there are no Minions among us, which should narrow down our search for the Werewolves.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** If the Masons confirm each other, we can trust them and narrow down our suspects to find the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Okay, if Larisa is the Seer and saw the Minion and Villager in the center, that means we only need to worry about the Werewolves now. I want to hear from the Masons. Please come forward and tell us if you saw each other.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Larisa's claim of being the Seer. By pointing out the lack of Masons coming forward, I'm trying to create confusion and distrust among the villagers. This could help divert attention from me and Cristina as the actual Werewolves. Additionally, by seeming analytical and cautious, I'm trying to present myself as a helpful villager rather than a Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** Hold on a second, Larisa. You claim to be the Seer, but something doesn't add up. If you really saw the Minion and Villager in the center, that means there should be two Werewolves among us. But nobody has come forward as a Mason yet. Isn't that suspicious? I think we should be very careful about trusting this information.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast suspicion away from myself and my partner Lucian. By questioning Alexandra about being a Mason, I'm indirectly supporting Larisa's claim of being the Seer, which could make me appear more trustworthy. This also puts pressure on Alexandra to reveal information or defend herself, potentially creating confusion among the villagers. If Alexandra denies being a Mason, it might make Larisa's claim as Seer seem less credible, which could benefit the Werewolf team.
> **Cristina:** I find it very suspicious that no one has come forward as a Mason yet. If Larisa is telling the truth about being the Seer and seeing the Minion and Villager in the center, we should have two Masons among us. Alexandra, you were quick to ask about the Seer. Are you perhaps one of the Masons trying to deflect attention?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I'm the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. Larisa's claim as the Seer aligns with this information, so I believe Larisa is being truthful. Our priority should now be finding the Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** I am one of the Masons, and I did not see another Mason when I woke up. This means the other Mason card is definitely in the center. Larisa's claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center seems consistent with my information. We should now focus on identifying the Werewolves among us.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Larisa's claim as the Seer aligns with my knowledge as the Mason, I find it suspicious that Lucian is trying to cast doubt on her. It's important to understand what role Lucian is claiming to better assess his motives.
> **Alexandra:** Lucian, I find it interesting that you were so quick to challenge Larisa's claim about being the Seer. Are you hiding something? What role do you claim to have?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Alexandra's claim of being a Mason, I'm attempting to create doubt about her credibility. This serves multiple purposes: it deflects suspicion from me, potentially discredits information that could lead to identifying the Werewolves, and sows general distrust among the players. By claiming to be a Villager, I'm trying to present myself as a neutral, analytical player rather than a Werewolf. The goal is to create a smokescreen of confusion that protects both me and Cristina
> **Lucian:** Alexandra, I appreciate you coming forward as a Mason, but I'm not entirely convinced. If you're truly a Mason and didn't see another one, why didn't you speak up earlier when Viktor asked about the Masons? Your timing seems a bit too convenient. As for my role, I'm a simple Villager trying to piece this puzzle together. I think we need to be cautious about trusting anyone too quickly, especially when the information doesn't align perfectly.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's initial push to hear from the Masons and subsequent silence is a bit suspicious. It's important to gather more information on his role to see if there's any inconsistency. If he's a Villager or Seer, he's an ally; but if he's stumbling over his claim, it might reveal him as a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Viktor, you were eager to hear from the Masons, but now that I've come forward, you're staying quiet. Why the sudden silence? What role are you claiming?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** If Larisa's claim as the Seer is true and Alexandra's Mason claim aligns with it, then Lucian's immediate challenge without providing concrete information might indicate he is hiding something. It's important to press him for details to clarify his role and intentions.
> **Viktor:** Lucian, you were quick to challenge Larisa's claim about being the Seer and pointed out inconsistencies. However, Alexandra's information about being a Mason aligns with Larisa's claim. Given that we have no Minion and you haven't provided any new information, I find your behavior suspicious. Are you perhaps trying to deflect attention? What role do you actually claim to have?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting suspicion back to Viktor, I'm attempting to create a divide among the villagers and shift focus away from myself. This serves multiple purposes: it keeps the attention off me as a Werewolf, potentially discredits Viktor if he has useful information, and continues to sow discord among the players. By appearing analytical and questioning, I'm trying to present myself as a concerned villager rather than a Werewolf. The goal is to create enough confusion and mistrust that it becomes difficult for the villagers to identify the true Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** I find it interesting that Viktor is now turning the suspicion towards me. Let's not forget that he was the one who initially asked about the Masons, yet he hasn't revealed his own role. Viktor, why are you so keen on questioning others while remaining secretive about your own identity? Are you perhaps trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's Seer claim and Alexandra's Mason claim appear to match the information they provided. Lucian's quick challenge and lack of concrete information make him seem suspicious and potentially a Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** Lucian, you seem very eager to sow doubt and point fingers without providing substantial information. Given that Larisa's claim as the Seer and Alexandra's claim as the Mason align with each other, your behavior is raising red flags for me. I'm starting to think you might be a Werewolf trying to confuse us.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By aggressively questioning Viktor and turning his accusation back on him, I'm attempting to deflect suspicion away from myself. This serves multiple purposes: it keeps the focus on Viktor, potentially discredits him if he has useful information, and continues to sow discord among the players. By appearing indignant and pushing for transparency, I'm trying to present myself as a concerned villager rather than a Werewolf. The goal is to create enough doubt about Viktor that the other players might consider him as a potential Werewolf, thus taking attention away from me and Cristina
> **Lucian:** I can't believe we're getting sidetracked like this! Viktor, your sudden accusation against me is exactly what a Werewolf would do to create chaos. You've been awfully quiet about your own role. If you're so concerned about finding the Werewolves, why don't you tell us what you are? Or are you just trying to hide behind false accusations?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** It's crucial to clarify Lucian's role, as his actions have been suspicious. By pressing him for more details, we can determine if he's genuinely a Villager or trying to mislead us as a Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** Lucian, you're quick to cast doubt without offering solid information. Given that Larisa's and Alexandra's claims support each other, your behavior stands out. What role are you claiming, specifically?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue sowing doubt and confusion. By targeting Alexandra, I'm attempting to discredit both her and Larisa's claims, which align and could lead to identifying the Werewolves. This serves to protect both myself and Cristina. By appearing passionate and analytical, I'm trying to present myself as a concerned villager rather than a Werewolf. The goal is to create enough suspicion around Alexandra and Larisa that the other players might consider them as potential threats, thus taking attention away from the real Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** I can't believe we're still dancing around this! Alexandra, you claim to be a Mason, but your story doesn't quite add up. If you're really a Mason and didn't see another one, why did you wait so long to speak up? It seems awfully convenient that you only came forward after I questioned Larisa's claim. Are you perhaps working with Larisa to deceive us all?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claim as Seer and my own as Mason align with each other. Lucian's aggressive questioning and refusal to claim a role makes him the most suspicious. We need to focus on him to find the Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** I think we need to get to the bottom of this quickly. Lucian, your behavior is incredibly suspicious. You're deflecting and casting doubt without offering any real information. If you're truly a Villager, you should be helping us piece this together, not causing chaos. I believe you might be one of the Werewolves.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue sowing doubt and confusion. By questioning Alexandra and Larisa's credibility together, I'm attempting to discredit their aligned claims, which could lead to identifying the Werewolves. This serves to protect both myself and Cristina. Additionally, by directing this statement to Cristina, I'm giving her an opportunity to support my doubts, potentially strengthening our position as a Werewolf team. By appearing passionate and analytical, I'm trying to present myself as a concerned villager rather than a Werewolf. The goal is to create enough suspicion around Alexandra and Larisa that the other players might consider them as potential threats, thus taking attention away from the real Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** I can't believe we're getting so sidetracked! Look, I understand everyone's suspicious, but we're losing sight of the real goal here. Alexandra and Larisa's stories seem a bit too convenient, don't they? They're supporting each other, but that doesn't mean they're telling the truth. For all we know, they could be the Werewolves working together to mislead us!


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question to Alexandra, I'm attempting to shift the focus away from myself and Lucian (my fellow Werewolf) while still maintaining an air of suspicion around Viktor. This move serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear collaborative and interested in uncovering the truth, it keeps the suspicion on Viktor, and it potentially puts Alexandra in a difficult position. If she accuses Viktor, it could help us eliminate a Villager. If she accuses Lucian, I can use that to argue that she and Larisa might be working together to mislead the group. Either way, it keeps the attention off me and potentially creates more chaos among the Villagers.
> **Cristina:** I'm getting really frustrated with all these accusations flying around! We need to focus on finding the real threats here. Lucian and Viktor, you two have been at each other's throats, but neither of you has provided any solid information. I think one of you might be a Werewolf trying to create chaos. Alexandra, as a claimed Mason, what's your take on this? Do you find either of them particularly suspicious?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian's aggressive questioning and refusal to claim a role make him the most suspicious. It's crucial to press him for a clear answer to determine if he's trying to deceive us.
> **Alexandra:** Lucian, your behavior has been incredibly suspicious throughout this discussion. You're deflecting and casting doubt without providing any solid information. Given that Larisa's and my claims support each other, I'm inclined to believe you might be a Werewolf. Can you give us a clear and honest answer about your role?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue sowing doubt and confusion. By questioning both Alexandra and Larisa's credibility together, I'm attempting to discredit their aligned claims, which could lead to identifying the Werewolves. This serves to protect both myself and Cristina. By appearing passionate and analytical, I'm trying to present myself as a concerned villager rather than a Werewolf. The goal is to create enough suspicion around Alexandra and Larisa that the other players might consider them as potential threats, thus taking attention away from the real Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** I'm getting tired of these baseless accusations! Alexandra, you claim to be a Mason, but your story still doesn't add up. Why did you wait so long to reveal your role? And Larisa, your Seer claim conveniently supports Alexandra's story. Are you two working together to mislead us? I think we need to consider the possibility that they might be the Werewolves trying to gain our trust!

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian has been aggressively questioning others and refusing to claim a specific role, which is highly suspicious. Larisa's and my claims align, suggesting we are both telling the truth. Lucian's behavior indicates he might be a Werewolf trying to sow doubt and confusion.
> **Alexandra [Mason]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian has been the most suspicious throughout the discussion. He has consistently deflected attention and cast doubt without providing any solid information. My claim as the Seer aligns with Alexandra's claim as the Mason, making Lucian's behavior stand out as potentially deceptive.
> **Larisa [Seer]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been deflecting and casting suspicion without providing concrete information. Larisa's claim as the Seer and Alexandra's claim as the Mason align with each other, making them more trustworthy. Lucian's behavior is consistent with that of a Werewolf trying to sow chaos and confusion. Voting for Lucian seems like the best choice to help the village team win.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention from myself and Cristina. Alexandra has been the most vocal about suspecting me, and her claim of being a Mason aligns with Larisa's Seer claim, which could lead to our discovery. By voting for Alexandra, I'm attempting to cast doubt on her credibility and create confusion among the villagers. This could potentially lead to the elimination of a key village team member and protect both Cristina and myself from detection.
> **Lucian [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and Lucian. Viktor has been relatively quiet and hasn't provided much information about his role. By voting for him, I'm hoping to create more suspicion around him and potentially eliminate a Villager. This also helps maintain my cover as I'm not directly defending Lucian, which might seem suspicious. Voting for Viktor aligns with my earlier questioning and keeps the focus off the actual Werewolves.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Viktor.


The votes were:
* Alexandra : Mason : 1
* Viktor : Villager : 1
* Lucian : Werewolf : 3



>***GAME:*** Lucian was killed. The villagers win.
