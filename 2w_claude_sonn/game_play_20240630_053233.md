## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to start gathering information, and directly asking what role someone had is a good way to begin. Mircea might reveal some useful information or give us clues through their response.
> **Michael:** Mircea, what role did you have last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing that I am a Mason and identifying Emil as the other Mason, I am establishing trust and narrowing down the suspects for the Werewolves. This can help the Village team focus on the other players who might be Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Mircea:** I was a Mason last night and I saw Emil as the other Mason. This means both of us are on the Village team. Let's figure out who the Werewolves are.


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** Given that Emil and I are Masons, we need to start by identifying other potential roles. It's important to understand where Marius stands, as this will help narrow down our search for the Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Mircea:** Marius, what role did you have last night?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Larisa. By questioning Emil and Mircea's claim, I'm creating doubt about the Masons while also appearing to be actively participating in finding the Werewolves. This makes me look less suspicious and potentially sets up Emil as a target for elimination. If Emil is indeed a Mason, eliminating him would be beneficial for the Werewolf team.
> **Marius:** I'm getting really suspicious of Emil. Mircea claims he saw Emil as the other Mason, but how can we be sure? Emil hasn't said anything to confirm this. For all we know, Emil could be a Werewolf trying to stay quiet and let Mircea's false claim protect him. What do you have to say for yourself, Emil?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** By confirming Mircea's claim, we can establish trust between the two of us and narrow down the suspects for the Werewolves. This will help the Village team strategize better.
> **Emil:** Guys, I can confirm Mircea's claim. I am indeed a Mason. Mircea saw me last night, and I saw him. This clears both of us as Villagers. Now, let's focus on finding the Werewolves.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Larisa. By questioning Emil and Mircea's claims, I'm sowing doubt about the Masons. At the same time, I'm directing attention to Larisa in a way that seems like I'm just trying to involve everyone in the discussion. This gives Larisa an opportunity to speak and potentially clear herself, while also making me appear proactive in finding the Werewolves. If Larisa handles this well, we can both appear innocent while casting suspicion on others.
> **Marius:** I'm not entirely convinced by Emil and Mircea's claims. It seems too convenient that they're both clearing each other so quickly. We need to be more thorough in our investigation. Larisa, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you have last night, and did you notice anything suspicious?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Marius. By questioning the quick alliance between Emil and Mircea without directly accusing them, I'm sowing seeds of doubt. More importantly, I'm redirecting attention to Michael, who hasn't spoken much. This serves two purposes: it makes me appear engaged and concerned about finding the Werewolves (thus less suspicious), and it puts pressure on Michael, potentially forcing him to reveal information that could be useful to the Werewolf team. If Michael is the Seer or the Minion, his response could be particularly valuable.
> **Larisa:** I find it very interesting that Emil and Mircea are so quick to confirm each's stories. While it's possible they're telling the truth, we shouldn't just accept it without question. I'm more concerned about Michael's silence. He hasn't contributed much to the discussion. Michael, what role did you have last night, and did you notice anything unusual?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been quick to cast doubt on Emil and Mircea's claims without providing solid evidence. We need to understand his reasoning to see if it's legitimate or if he's trying to deflect attention away from himself.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, let's focus and think logically here. Mircea and Emil's claims about being Masons seem to align, but we can't blindly trust them. Marius, you're casting suspicion on Emil without much evidence. Can you provide more reasoning for your doubts?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to keep suspicion away from myself and Larisa. By redirecting the conversation back to Michael and pointing out his evasion, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I appear proactive and logical, which is how a Villager might act. 2) I'm keeping pressure on Michael, who might be a Villager or Seer, making him a good target for elimination. 3) I'm subtly supporting Larisa by reinforcing her question, which helps build our credibility as a team without appearing too coordinated. 4) By asking about Michael's role and observations, I might gain valuable information about the remaining roles in play, which could help us Werewolves in the long run.
> **Marius:** Michael, I appreciate you asking for more reasoning, but I find it suspicious that you're deflecting attention onto me instead of answering Larisa's direct question about your role. What are you trying to hide? Can you please tell us your role and what you observed last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** It's essential to understand why Marius is casting doubt on Emil and Mircea. If he's genuinely suspicious, he should have more concrete reasons. If not, he might be deflecting attention away from himself.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and think. Mircea and Emil both claim to be Masons and are confirming each other's stories. While it's possible they could be telling the truth, we need to be cautious. If they are indeed Masons, their roles are safe. However, we still need to identify the Werewolves among us. Marius, you've been quick to cast doubt on Emil and Mircea with little evidence. Can you provide more reasons for your suspicions?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and Larisa. By directly accusing Michael of being a Werewolf, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm appearing proactive and determined to find the Werewolves, which is how a Villager would act. 2) I'm putting pressure on Michael, who might be a Villager or Seer, making him a good target for elimination. 3) I'm indirectly supporting Larisa's earlier question about Michael's silence, which helps build our credibility as a team without appearing too coordinated. 4) By pushing Michael to reveal his role, I might gain valuable information about the remaining roles in play, which could help us Werewolves in the long run. This accusation also serves to create chaos and confusion among the Villagers, which is beneficial for the Werewolf team.
> **Marius:** Michael, I find your evasiveness highly suspicious. You've been deflecting questions and haven't revealed your role yet. As someone who's trying to find the Werewolves, I think it's crucial that we all share our roles. I'm starting to wonder if you might be hiding something... perhaps a Werewolf identity?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been quick to cast suspicion and deflect attention without solid grounds. By questioning him directly, we might be able to get more information or see if he's trying to hide something.
> **Michael:** Alright, it seems like we're going in circles with accusations and counter-accusations. Mircea and Emil have both claimed to be Masons, and while we should be cautious, there's a good chance they're telling the truth. Marius, you've been very vocal in sowing doubt without providing concrete evidence. I think it's time to hear more from you.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager and pushing Michael to reveal his role, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm maintaining my cover as a Werewolf by claiming a safe, common role. 2) I'm keeping the pressure on Michael, who might be a Seer or another important Village role. 3) I'm appearing proactive and transparent, which aligns with Villager behavior. 4) If Michael reveals his role, it could provide valuable information for the Werewolf team. 5) By focusing on Michael, I'm indirectly protecting Larisa and myself from scrutiny.
> **Marius:** I understand the suspicion towards me, Michael, but let's not forget that you still haven't revealed your role. As someone genuinely trying to find the Werewolves, I think it's crucial we all share our roles. I'll go first: I'm a Villager. Now, can you please tell us your role and what you observed last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more information and see if anyone's story contradicts itself. By questioning Marius's motivations and getting Larisa's perspective, we can gather more clues and spot inconsistencies.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, let's be logical and thorough. Mircea and Emil have claimed to be Masons, which means they are likely safe if they're telling the truth. Marius, you've been vocal about your suspicions but haven't really provided solid reasons. Why are you so adamant about doubting Mircea and Emil? And Larisa, you've been quiet. What do you think about all this?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Marius. By focusing suspicion on Michael, who has indeed been evasive, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I appear engaged and concerned about finding the Werewolves, which makes me seem less suspicious. 2) I'm putting pressure on Michael, who might be the Seer or another important role. If he reveals his role, it could be valuable information for the Werewolf team. 3) By aligning my suspicions with Marius's previous accusations, I'm subtly supporting my fellow Werewolf without making it obvious that we're working together. This strategy helps protect both of us while potentially exposing a key village role.
> **Larisa:** I've been listening carefully to everyone's claims and accusations, and I have to say, I'm becoming increasingly suspicious of Michael. He's been deflecting questions about his role and trying to redirect suspicion onto others without providing any substantial information himself. This behavior is typical of someone who has something to hide. Michael, I think it's time you come clean about your role and what you observed last night. Your evasiveness is not helping the village team.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's been quiet and only chimed in to suspect me without much evidence. By getting her to share her role and observations, we can gather more information and potentially spot inconsistencies in her story.
> **Michael:** Larisa, you've been quiet for a while. I understand your suspicion towards me, but I'd like to know more about your role and any observations you might have made last night. Your input could be crucial in identifying the Werewolves.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Marius. By questioning Marius, I'm creating an appearance of impartiality and concern for finding the truth. This makes me seem less suspicious while also giving Marius an opportunity to defend himself, potentially strengthening his position. Additionally, by bringing attention back to the Mason claims, I'm indirectly casting doubt on Emil and Mircea, who are likely village team members. This strategy helps to create confusion and mistrust among the villagers, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Larisa:** I find it interesting that we're all focusing so much on Michael when Marius has been equally evasive. Marius, you were quick to accuse Emil and Mircea without much evidence, and then you conveniently claimed to be a Villager when pressed. That seems awfully suspicious to me. Can you explain why you were so quick to doubt the Masons and what exactly you did during the night phase?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to protect both myself and Larisa. By redirecting suspicion back to her, I'm creating an opportunity for her to defend herself and potentially clear both of us. This also makes me appear more proactive and less suspicious. Additionally, by questioning Larisa's role, I'm indirectly supporting Michael's previous question to her, which helps to keep the focus off of us Werewolves and maintains the chaos and confusion among the Villagers. This strategy aims to divide the other players and make it harder for them to identify the true Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Larisa, I appreciate your attempt to shift the focus, but let's not forget that you've been quite evasive yourself. You've barely shared any information about your role or observations. Instead, you've been quick to point fingers at others. That's classic Werewolf behavior. Can you finally tell us what your role is and what you observed during the night phase?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and Marius. By targeting Emil, who has been relatively quiet, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I appear engaged and proactive in finding the Werewolves, which makes me seem less suspicious. 2) I'm putting pressure on a likely Village team member, potentially forcing them to reveal more information that could be useful to the Werewolf team. 3) By questioning the Mason claim indirectly, I'm sowing seeds of doubt about both Emil and Mircea, which could lead to a valuable Village team member being eliminated. This strategy helps protect both Werewolves while potentially exposing key village roles or creating discord among the villagers.
> **Larisa:** I've been observing everyone's behavior carefully, and I have to say, Emil's silence is becoming more and more suspicious. He quickly confirmed Mircea's claim about being Masons, but hasn't contributed much since then. That's exactly what a Werewolf might do to avoid scrutiny. Emil, can you explain why you've been so quiet and what else you observed during the night phase?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael has consistently avoided sharing his role and has deflected suspicion onto others without providing concrete information. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with what a Werewolf would do to avoid detection.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, it's time to get serious. Michael has been dodging questions and deflecting attention for way too long. I think there's a high chance Michael is a Werewolf. It's time we focus on him.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been the most vocal in casting doubt on Mircea and Emil's claims without providing solid evidence. His behavior seems like he's trying to deflect attention away from himself, which is suspicious. Additionally, both Mircea and Emil have confirmed each other as Masons, which adds credibility to their claims. Larisa has also been evasive, but Marius's actions seem more calculated to sow distrust among the group.
> **Michael [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael has been evasive and deflecting questions throughout the discussion. Both Emil and I have confirmed each other as Masons, while Michael has not provided any substantial information or revealed his role convincingly. His behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with that of a Werewolf or Minion trying to avoid detection.
> **Mircea [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate potential threats to our team. Michael has been evasive throughout the game, refusing to reveal his role despite multiple questions. This behavior makes him a perfect target for elimination. By voting for Michael, I'm not only potentially removing a Village team member but also maintaining my cover as a concerned Villager trying to find the Werewolves. Additionally, Emil's recent accusation against Michael provides me with a convenient reason to vote for him without raising suspicion about my true motives. This vote aligns with the group's growing suspicion towards Michael, making it less likely for others to question my decision.
> **Marius [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager to increase our chances of winning. Michael has been the most evasive throughout the game, refusing to reveal his role or provide any substantial information. By voting for him, I'm aligning myself with the growing suspicion against him, which makes me appear less suspicious. Additionally, if Michael is indeed a key village role like the Seer, eliminating him would be a significant advantage for the Werewolf team. This vote also helps protect my fellow Werewolf, Marius, by diverting attention away from him.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Throughout the day phase, Michael has repeatedly avoided sharing his role and has tried to shift suspicion onto others without providing concrete evidence. This evasive behavior is highly indicative of a Werewolf trying to avoid detection. By voting for Michael, I aim to neutralize this potential threat to the Village team.
> **Emil [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


The votes were:
* Michael : Villager : 4
* Marius : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The werewolves win.
