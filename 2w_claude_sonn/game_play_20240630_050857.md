## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Alexandra and Michael. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dragos. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Andrei. They are thinking about their action.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards gives me more information about the possible roles that could be in play or might have been exchanged, providing a broader understanding of the game's state. This will help in identifying false claims during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Knowing who the Masons are will quickly help us identify trustworthy players, reducing the pool of potential werewolves and aiding us in our decision-making.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's get some information flowing! Can we start by having any Masons identify themselves? If we can confirm them, that will help us narrow down the suspects.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I want to deflect attention away from the Masons and onto the Seer. This serves two purposes: it makes me appear helpful and interested in gathering information, while also potentially exposing the Seer, who is a threat to the Werewolf team. By asking about night phase information, I'm fishing for any players who might reveal themselves as the Seer or other roles, which could help me and Michael (the other Werewolf) identify targets for elimination.
> **Alexandra:** I don't think we have any Masons in this game, Viktor. If we did, they would have spoken up by now. I'm more concerned about finding the Seer. Has anyone received any useful information during the night phase?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Alexandra. By questioning Viktor's motives, I'm creating doubt about his intentions and potentially making him look suspicious. This could help shift the focus away from the real Werewolves. Additionally, by mentioning that we should be looking for Werewolves instead of Masons, I'm presenting myself as a concerned villager, which aligns with my goal of appearing innocent.
> **Michael:** I'm quite suspicious of Viktor's eagerness to identify the Masons. It seems like he's trying to divert our attention from something more important. Viktor, why are you so focused on the Masons when we should be looking for the Werewolves?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra's confident dismissal of the Masons could be an attempt to disrupt the village team's strategy. If she's trying to divert our attention, we need to understand her motivation and gather more information.
> **Viktor:** Alexandra, that's quite an assertive statement about the lack of Masons in the game. How can you be so sure? Did you see something during the night that makes you confident there are no Masons?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to backtrack on my previous statement about Masons to avoid suspicion. By admitting I didn't see anything at night, I'm reinforcing my false claim of being a Villager. Directing attention to Andrei serves two purposes: it takes the focus off me and potentially reveals information about another player's role. If Andrei is the Seer or a Mason, this question might prompt him to reveal information that could be useful to the Werewolf team.
> **Alexandra:** Viktor, I'm not certain there are no Masons, I was just speculating based on their silence. But you're right, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. To answer your question, I didn't see anything during the night. I'm just a simple Villager trying to piece things together like the rest of us. What about you, Andrei? You've been awfully quiet. Did you have any night-time revelations that could help us identify the Werewolves?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra's confidence about the Masons' absence is suspicious since I saw a Mason card in the center. This could suggest she is trying to divert attention from herself or her allies.
> **Andrei:** Alexandra, you seem very adamant about the lack of Masons. That makes me think you might be trying to mislead us. Why are you so certain?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Andrei's accusation and turning it back on him, I'm attempting to deflect suspicion away from myself while also putting pressure on Andrei. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear more innocent by being open to correction, it casts doubt on Andrei's motives, and it might prompt Andrei to reveal more information about his role. If Andrei is a Villager or Seer, getting him to reveal information could be beneficial for the Werewolf team. Additionally, by asking about his role, I'm indirectly gathering information that could be useful for identifying potential targets for elimination.
> **Alexandra:** Andrei, I appreciate your concern, but I think you're misinterpreting my words. I wasn't adamant about the lack of Masons; I was simply making an observation based on the silence. I've already admitted that I jumped to conclusions too quickly. What's really interesting is how quickly you're trying to shift suspicion onto me. Are you perhaps deflecting attention from yourself? What role are you playing in this game?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's immediate suspicion of Viktor could be an attempt to deflect attention from himself. Understanding his reasoning and his role can provide more clarity and help in identifying possible Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Michael, you've been quick to cast suspicion on Viktor but haven't offered much about your own role. Why do you think Viktor is diverting attention, and what role are you playing in this game?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to shift suspicion away from myself and Alexandra. By questioning Andrei's motives and highlighting his lack of contribution, I'm creating doubt about his intentions and potentially making him look like a Werewolf. This serves two purposes: it deflects attention from me and Alexandra, and it puts pressure on a potential Villager or Seer. Additionally, by asking for others' opinions, I'm presenting myself as a team player concerned about finding the real Werewolves, which aligns with my goal of appearing innocent.
> **Michael:** I find it very suspicious that Andrei is trying to deflect attention onto me. I've been open about my concerns regarding Viktor's focus on Masons, which I believe is a valid point. Andrei, on the other hand, seems to be grasping at straws to cast doubt on others without providing any useful information himself. I think we should be more worried about Andrei's behavior. What do you all think about his sudden accusation towards me?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's quick suspicion of Viktor and his deflection toward Andrei seems suspicious. He hasn't offered any concrete information about his own role, making it likely that he's hiding something, possibly being a Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** Michael, you seem really eager to cast suspicion on others without revealing any useful information about yourself. I'm calling you out as a likely Werewolf. Explain why you're so eager to point fingers while staying in the shadows?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting the accusation back to Andrei and highlighting his lack of contribution, I'm attempting to shift suspicion away from myself. I'm also bringing Dragos into the conversation, who has been quiet so far. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear as a concerned villager trying to involve everyone, it puts pressure on Andrei who might be a Villager or Seer, and it forces Dragos to speak up, potentially revealing information about his role. By asking for Dragos' opinion, I'm also setting up a potential future alliance if Dragos agrees with my suspicion of Andrei.
> **Michael:** I find it ironic that Andrei is accusing me of being a Werewolf when he's the one who's been evasive and quick to point fingers. Let's take a step back and look at the facts: I've been open about my concerns regarding Viktor's focus on Masons, which I believe is a valid point. Andrei, on the other hand, has contributed nothing substantial to our discussion and seems more interested in creating chaos than finding the real Werewolves. I think we should all be very wary of Andrei's behavior. What do you think, Dragos? You've been quiet so far. Do you find Andrei's actions as suspicious as I do?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra's quick dismissal of the Masons raises red flags. It seems like a tactic to divert suspicion. We need to scrutinize her actions more closely.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, I think it's time we get some real accusations going. Alexandra, your initial statement about there being no Masons seemed very suspicious to me. Why did you feel the need to so quickly conclude that there were no Masons? It feels like you're trying to mislead us.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting Dragos' accusation back to Andrei and Michael, I'm attempting to shift suspicion away from myself while also maintaining my facade as a concerned Villager. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear more innocent by acknowledging my earlier mistake, it casts doubt on Andrei and Michael's motives, and it might prompt Dragos to reveal more information about his own role or suspicions. Additionally, by asking Dragos for his opinion, I'm indirectly gathering information that could be useful for identifying potential targets for elimination while also potentially creating discord among the Villagers.
> **Alexandra:** Dragos, I appreciate you trying to move the game forward, but I think you're barking up the wrong tree here. My initial statement about the Masons was simply an observation based on their silence, which I've already admitted was hasty. What's more concerning is how quickly some players, like Andrei and Michael, have been to throw accusations around without providing any substantial information themselves. Dragos, what's your take on their behavior? Do you find it as suspicious as I do?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's evasive and accusatory behavior stands out as an attempt to create chaos and distract us from identifying the real Werewolves. It's crucial to put pressure on him to reveal more about his role and intentions.
> **Dragos:** Andrei, you have been quick to point fingers at Michael without providing any substantial evidence or information about your own role. Your behavior seems erratic and suspicious. Why are you deflecting so much?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's behavior has been consistently suspicious. By questioning him directly, we can put pressure on him to reveal more about his role, which will help us gather more information and potentially identify if he is a Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** Michael, you've been very quick to point fingers at Viktor and me, without revealing anything about your own role. This makes me very suspicious of you. Why are you so eager to accuse others without sharing any useful information about yourself?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly challenging Andrei and asking about his night actions, I'm attempting to put him on the defensive. This serves multiple purposes: it deflects attention from me, potentially exposes information about Andrei's role (which could be useful if he's the Seer or a Mason), and makes me appear proactive in trying to find the Werewolves. If Andrei is a Villager, this pressure might make him slip up or appear suspicious to others. If he's the Seer, he might be forced to reveal information that could be useful to us Werewolves. Additionally, by framing Andrei's accusations as attempts to create chaos, I'm subtly suggesting that he might be the Werewolf trying to mislead the group.
> **Michael:** I think we're getting off track here. Andrei, you keep accusing me without any real evidence, and it's starting to look like you're trying to create chaos to hide something. Why don't you tell us what you actually did during the night phase? Did you have any special role or ability? Your evasiveness is really making me wonder if you're the one we should be worried about.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael has been quick to accuse both Viktor and me while providing no useful information about his own role. His consistent attempts to deflect attention make him highly suspect. As a Seer, I know Minion and Mason are in the center, so we need to focus on identifying the real threats among us.
> **Andrei:** Listen everyone, I've been analyzing the situation, and I'm getting more convinced that Michael's behavior is extremely suspicious. He hasn't provided any concrete information about his role and is eager to deflect attention onto others. We need to put more pressure on Michael to reveal his role or explain his actions. Otherwise, we might be letting a Werewolf slip through our grasp.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's evasiveness and quick accusations towards Viktor and Andrei are suspicious. As a Mason, I need to gather more information to help identify the real Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Michael, you've been very vocal about accusing others without revealing much about yourself. This seems like a classic deflection tactic. What exactly did you do during the night phase?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue deflecting suspicion away from myself while also casting doubt on others. By claiming to be a villager and providing a straightforward answer about my lack of night actions, I'm attempting to appear honest and cooperative. At the same time, I'm redirecting attention back to Andrei, who has been a vocal accuser. By highlighting his evasiveness and lack of information, I'm trying to make him look more suspicious than me. This serves to protect both myself and Alexandra (the other Werewolf) while potentially setting up Andrei (who could be the Seer or a Mason) as a target for elimination. Additionally, by framing my statement as a call for concrete evidence, I'm positioning myself as someone genuinely interested in finding the Werewolves, further masking my true identity.
> **Michael:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting too caught up in this endless cycle of accusations. As a concerned villager, I believe we need to focus on finding concrete evidence. Dragos, you asked what I did during the night phase. The truth is, I didn't have any special night actions. I'm just a simple villager trying to piece things together like most of us. But I find it interesting that you're so keen on questioning me when Andrei has been far more evasive. Andrei, you still haven't told us what you did during the night. Your constant deflection and refusal to provide any information about your role is extremely suspicious. Why don't you come clean and tell us what you know?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's behavior has been consistently suspicious. His quick accusations and lack of information about his own role make him highly suspect. As a Seer, I know that the Minion and a Mason are in the center, which means Michael's potential deflection tactics need to be scrutinized further.
> **Andrei:** I've been listening to everyone's responses carefully, and I'm getting increasingly convinced that Michael is hiding something. He's been very vocal about accusing others without providing any concrete information about his own role. We need to put more pressure on him to reveal his role or explain his actions.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael has been very vocal about accusing others without providing any concrete information about his own role. This deflective behavior is typical of a Werewolf trying to sow confusion among the villagers. Andrei and I have been actively participating in the discussion, but Michael's evasiveness and eagerness to point fingers make him the most suspicious.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from Michael (the other Werewolf) and myself. Andrei has been increasingly vocal and suspicious of Michael, which poses a threat to our team. By voting for Andrei, I'm hoping to eliminate a potential threat while also appearing to side with the majority opinion that has been forming against him. This move allows me to blend in with the villagers and maintain my cover, while also protecting my Werewolf ally.
> **Alexandra [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate potential threats. Andrei has been particularly vocal in accusing me, which makes him a danger to my team. By voting for him, I'm not only protecting myself but also potentially eliminating a key village role like the Seer or a Mason. Additionally, I've consistently pointed out Andrei's evasiveness throughout the game, so voting for him aligns with my previous statements and doesn't raise suspicion. This vote also helps protect Alexandra, the other Werewolf, by keeping attention away from her.
> **Michael [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael has been consistently deflecting suspicion onto others without providing any concrete information about his own role. As the Seer, I know that the Minion and a Mason are in the center, which means Michael's evasiveness and quick accusations make him highly suspect. Voting for Michael will help us determine if he is a Werewolf.
> **Andrei [Seer]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra's initial statement about there being no Masons seemed like an attempt to sow confusion. Despite acknowledging her mistake, she kept trying to deflect suspicion onto others without providing any useful information about herself. This behavior is very suspicious and aligns with the actions of a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos [Mason]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


The votes were:
* Alexandra : Werewolf : 1
* Michael : Werewolf : 2
* Andrei : Seer : 2



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Michael, Andrei. The villagers win.
