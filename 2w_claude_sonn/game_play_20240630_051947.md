## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Ileana and Alexia. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Lucian is a minion and is aware that both Ileana and Alexia are werewolves.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dracula. They are thinking about their action.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards gives a broader understanding of the possible roles in play, especially useful if either Werewolf or Minion roles are in the center. This information can help me better inform the village team and identify false claims.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing that two of the center cards are a Villager and a Mason, I can narrow down the roles that might be in play among the players. This information helps us detect false claims and align our strategies.
> **Dracula:** I've got some interesting information to share with everyone. I checked the center cards during the night, and I found a Villager and a Mason there.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Given that Dracula's information could be crucial, understanding his reasoning for choosing the center cards may give us insight into whether he's being truthful or trying to mislead us.
> **Vladimir:** Dracula, can you provide any more details about why you chose to check the center cards instead of another player's card?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Vladimir's question directly, I can clarify my reasoning and provide useful information to the village team. This also sets the stage to evaluate any claims made by other players.
> **Dracula:** Vladimir, I chose to check the center cards because it gives us a broader understanding of the possible roles in play. By confirming that a Villager and a Mason are in the center, we can narrow down the roles that might still be in the game and detect any false claims.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** By pressing Dracula for his suspicions, I can gauge his reactions and see if he's trying to deflect or provide genuine insights. This can help us narrow down potential Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Dracula, that's interesting information. But if you saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, that means there are fewer roles left to consider. Do you suspect anyone specifically of being a Werewolf based on this information?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian hasn't spoken up yet, and it's important to hear from everyone to gather more information. His response might give clues about his role or reveal inconsistencies.
> **Dracula:** Lucian, you’ve been pretty quiet. Can you tell us what role you have and if you did any actions during the night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Minion):*** By emphasizing the need for caution and suggesting that Dracula's information might not be trustworthy, I aim to plant seeds of doubt among the players. This helps in creating confusion and diverting attention away from Ileana and Alexia, the actual Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Alright, Dracula, that's an interesting claim. But I want to point out that just because you say you saw a Villager and a Mason in the center doesn't mean it's true. We need to be cautious about trusting any single piece of information without verification. I personally didn't see any center cards or do anything last night since I'm just a Villager. But I do have a strong feeling that someone might be trying to mislead us.


***Lucian (thoughts as Minion):*** By targeting Dracula with a direct accusation, I am creating doubt about his Seer claim and causing confusion. This diverts attention from Ileana and Alexia, who are the actual Werewolves. It also helps to disrupt the trust among the Villagers, making it harder for them to work together effectively.
> **Lucian:** Dracula, your claim about the center cards is interesting, but it doesn't entirely add up. If there's a Villager and a Mason in the center, it means one role is likely missing. Could you be lying to throw us off? Because if there are fewer roles in play, it's easier to narrow down who the werewolves might be. I think you're trying to mislead us.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** It's crucial to get input from everyone to piece together the full picture. We need to hear from Alexia to see if her information aligns with what we know so far and to identify any potential inconsistencies.
> **Dracula:** Alexia, we haven't heard from you yet. Could you share your role and any actions you took during the night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Ileana. By questioning Dracula's claim and asking Vladimir for more information, I'm attempting to create doubt and confusion among the villagers. This also gives me an opportunity to gauge Vladimir's reaction and potentially identify if he's a Seer or another role that might be dangerous to the Werewolf team. Additionally, by engaging in the conversation and asking questions, I'm trying to appear as a helpful villager who's actively trying to solve the mystery.
> **Alexia:** I'm starting to get really suspicious of Dracula's claim about the center cards. If what he's saying is true, it narrows down our options significantly. But something doesn't feel right. Vladimir, you were quick to question Dracula. What's your role, and did you notice anything during the night phase that might contradict or support Dracula's statement?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's strong suspicion of Dracula might indicate she has information she's not sharing. Pressing her for details can help us understand her reasoning and potentially reveal inconsistencies.
> **Vladimir:** Alexia, you seem very suspicious of Dracula's claim. What role do you have and did you take any actions during the night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By claiming to be a Mason, I'm presenting myself as a villager role while also partially corroborating Dracula's story. This might make me seem more trustworthy. At the same time, I'm casting subtle doubt on Dracula's full claim, which could help create confusion. By directing the question back to Vladimir, I'm putting pressure on him and potentially identifying if he's a dangerous role like the Seer. This strategy allows me to appear helpful while actually working against the village team.
> **Alexia:** Vladimir, I find it interesting that you're so quick to question me when I'm just trying to contribute information to help us villagers. As for my role, I'm actually a Mason. I woke up during the night and didn't see another Mason, which means the other Mason card must be in the center. This actually aligns with what Dracula said about seeing a Mason in the center. However, I'm still not entirely convinced about the Villager card he claims to have seen. What about you, Vladimir? What's your role, and did you perform any actions during the night that could shed more light on this situation?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Given that Alexia's claim about being a Mason aligns with Dracula's information, it adds some credibility to his statement. However, Lucian's strong objection and suspicion without providing solid reasoning seem suspicious, making me question his true role.
> **Vladimir:** Alexia, you claim to be a Mason and did not see another Mason, which aligns with Dracula’s claim of seeing a Mason in the center. But I find it suspicious that Lucian, who also claimed to be a Villager, is questioning the validity of Dracula’s information. If Lucian is a Villager as he says, why would he be so distrustful of Dracula’s claim? Lucian, are you hiding something?


***Lucian (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Vladimir directly, I can try to put him on the defensive and create doubt about his role. This will help distract everyone from the true Werewolves, Ileana and Alexia, and keep the focus on the Villagers, making it easier to manipulate the outcome of the vote.
> **Lucian:** Vladimir, you seem awfully quick to jump to conclusions about me. If you're so sure about everyone's roles, why don't you tell us what you actually did during the night? What role are you claiming?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Given that Dracula and Alexia's claims align, but Lucian is casting doubt without reason, it's important to press Lucian to see if he's hiding something or just trying to sow confusion.
> **Vladimir:** Lucian, your strong objection to Dracula's claim without providing solid reasoning makes me question your true role. If you're really a Villager, why are you so distrustful of Dracula's claim when it seems to align with Alexia's information?


***Lucian (thoughts as Minion):*** By expressing doubt about Dracula's claim and emphasizing the need for caution, I aim to create confusion and distrust among the Villagers. This will help divert attention away from Ileana and Alexia, the actual Werewolves, and keep the focus on questioning the validity of the information provided by the Villagers.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's not get too carried away with Dracula's claim of seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center. While it might align with Alexia's claim of being a Mason, it doesn't necessarily make it true. Remember, just because some information seems to fit doesn't mean it's accurate. We need to be careful about jumping to conclusions, especially when we don't have solid evidence. I'm still not convinced by Dracula's story, and it's raising some red flags for me.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Alexia. Lucian has been vocal about questioning Dracula's claims, which could potentially expose us. By targeting Lucian and painting him as suspicious, I'm hoping to shift the group's focus onto him. This also indirectly supports Dracula's claim, which aligns with Alexia's statement about being a Mason. By seeming to side with Dracula and Alexia, I'm positioning myself as a trustworthy villager while secretly protecting my Werewolf team.
> **Ileana:** I'm starting to get really concerned about Lucian's behavior. He's been quick to dismiss Dracula's information and hasn't provided any substantial information himself. Lucian, if you're truly a Villager as you claim, why are you so adamant about discrediting Dracula's findings? It seems like you might be trying to create confusion to hide something.


***Lucian (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Vladimir of being a Werewolf, I aim to divert suspicion away from Ileana and Alexia while also putting Vladimir on the defensive. This keeps the attention off the actual Werewolves and sows further distrust among the Villagers, making it easier to manipulate the final vote.
> **Lucian:** Vladimir, I find it very suspicious that you keep deflecting every time someone questions you. So far, you've been quick to cast doubt on Dracula's claim and even more eager to point fingers at me. This aggressive behavior makes me think you might be trying to hide something. Since you haven't provided any concrete information about your role, I'm starting to suspect that you could be the Werewolf here. Everyone, let's not forget that creating confusion and pointing fingers is a common tactic for Werewolves trying to blend in.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's aggressive behavior and constant doubt without solid reasoning are classic tactics of a Werewolf trying to create confusion. Pressing him for concrete evidence might reveal inconsistencies and help us identify if he's hiding something.
> **Vladimir:** Lucian, you keep questioning Dracula's claim without giving us any solid reasoning. This makes me highly suspicious of your role. If you're truly a Villager, why are you so adamant about dismissing Dracula's information? Can you provide any concrete evidence to back up your doubts?


***Lucian (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting suspicion on Vladimir, who hasn't provided as much concrete information, I aim to divert attention from the actual Werewolves, Ileana and Alexia. This tactic helps create distrust among the Villagers and keeps the focus away from the true Werewolves, aiding in their survival.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, I've been listening carefully to all the claims and accusations, and I think we need to focus on something important. We've got two conflicting claims from Dracula and Alexia. Dracula says he saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, while Alexia claims to be a Mason who didn't see another Mason, which aligns with Dracula's claim. However, if the Mason and Villager are in the center, it means the roles among us are limited. Vladimir's quickness to deflect and question everyone else makes me highly suspicious. I think there's a strong possibility that Vladimir is the Werewolf here, trying to sow confusion.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and Ileana. By targeting Vladimir, who hasn't revealed much information, I'm creating a scapegoat. This also puts pressure on Vladimir to reveal his role, which could be beneficial if he's a Seer or another threat to the Werewolf team. Additionally, by appearing to be actively investigating and questioning others, I'm portraying myself as a concerned villager, further cementing my false Mason claim.
> **Alexia:** I've been carefully observing everyone's behavior, and I have to say, Vladimir's actions are raising some serious red flags. He's been quick to question others but hasn't provided any substantial information about his own role or actions. This kind of deflection is classic Werewolf behavior. Vladimir, if you're not a Werewolf, then please, enlighten us. What's your role, and what did you do during the night phase?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir has been quick to question others and deflect attention without providing substantial information about his own role. His behavior raises red flags and aligns with classic Werewolf tactics. Additionally, Alexia's claim of being a Mason and not seeing another Mason aligns with my information about a Mason being in the center, which further supports the idea that Vladimir might be trying to sow confusion.
> **Dracula [Seer]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been aggressively questioning Dracula's information without providing any substantial reasoning or evidence. His behavior is suspicious and classic of someone trying to create confusion. Given that Dracula's and Alexia's claims align, Lucian's actions make him the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf.
> **Vladimir [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Minion):*** Vladimir has been deflecting questions and casting doubt on others without providing substantial information about his own role. His behavior raises suspicion that he might be a Werewolf trying to create confusion. Voting for Vladimir could help protect the actual Werewolves, Ileana and Alexia, and increase the chances of the Werewolf team winning.
> **Lucian [Minion]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and Alexia. Vladimir has been acting suspiciously by questioning others without providing information about his own role. By voting for Vladimir, I'm supporting Lucian's accusation, which helps maintain my cover as a villager. This also takes attention away from Alexia and me, increasing our chances of winning.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Ileana. Vladimir has been evasive throughout the game, deflecting questions and not providing any concrete information about his role. By voting for Vladimir, I'm reinforcing the suspicion I've cast on him during the day phase. This strategy serves to eliminate a potential threat (if Vladimir is indeed a powerful role like the Seer) or a villager, both of which benefit the Werewolf team. Additionally, by voting in line with the suspicions I've raised, I maintain my facade as a concerned Mason trying to help the village team.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


The votes were:
* Vladimir : Villager : 4
* Lucian : Minion : 1



>***GAME:*** Vladimir was killed. The werewolves win.
