## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Michael and Kraven. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dracula. They are thinking about their action.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards provides more information about the roles that are not in play. This helps narrow down the possibilities of what the other players' roles could be, making it easier to identify potential Werewolves.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Since I am a Villager with no special abilities, I need to gather as much information as possible from the other players. If someone claims to have seen a Werewolf, it might help us narrow down our suspicions quickly.
> **Lucian:** Alright, let's get to the bottom of this! I've got a question for everyone: has anyone here seen a Werewolf during the night phase?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's question could be an attempt to deflect suspicion. I want to press him for more details and see how he responds.
> **Alexandra:** Lucian, you asked if anyone saw a Werewolf during the night. I'm curious, what did you see? Or are you just trying to throw us off?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** I need to prompt the Seer or Masons to come forward with any information they have. By being transparent about my lack of night activity, I'm trying to build trust with the other players and see if Alexandra's suspicious response will lead to more information.
> **Lucian:** Honestly, Alexandra, I'm just a Villager and I didn't see anything during the night. But your response makes me a bit suspicious. Seers, Masons, if you gathered any useful info, please share.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing the center cards I saw helps narrow down the roles in play, making it easier to identify potential Werewolves. Since Lucian claims to be a Villager, this information could help verify or refute his claim.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let's focus. I didn't see any Werewolves, but I did check two center cards and found a Villager and a Mason. This means there's one less Villager and one less Mason among us. We need to figure out who could be lying about their roles.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Dracula's claim of being the Seer. If he's telling the truth, he could be a threat to me and Kraven. By questioning his claim, I'm trying to discredit him and make others suspicious of him. This could potentially lead to him being voted out, which would be beneficial for the Werewolf team. Additionally, by taking an active role in questioning others, I'm trying to appear as a concerned Villager, which could help deflect suspicion from myself.
> **Michael:** Hold on a second, Dracula. You're claiming to be the Seer and that you checked two center cards? That's awfully convenient. How do we know you're not just trying to throw us off? Maybe you're a Werewolf trying to gain our trust.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's immediate suspicion could be an attempt to deflect suspicion from himself. If he claims a role, we can cross-reference it with the known center cards and other players' claims to find inconsistencies.
> **Dracula:** Alright Michael, you seem awfully quick to doubt me. If you're not hiding something, what role do you claim to be?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover as a Villager. By claiming to be a Villager and expressing skepticism towards Dracula's Seer claim, I'm trying to appear as a concerned member of the village team. This helps deflect suspicion from myself while also casting doubt on Dracula, who could be a threat to the Werewolf team if he's actually the Seer. By asking for more details and inviting others to share information, I'm attempting to gather intel on other players' roles while appearing cooperative and engaged in the game.
> **Michael:** I'm actually a Villager, Dracula. I'm questioning you because that's what we're supposed to do in this game - find the Werewolves. Your claim about being the Seer and checking the center cards seems a bit too convenient. If you're really the Seer, can you give us more details about what you saw? And to the rest of you, does anyone else have any information that could help us identify the Werewolves?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Dracula's claim of being the Seer, as this could be dangerous for me and Michael. By questioning both Dracula and Michael, I'm trying to create confusion and mistrust among the players. This also helps me appear as a thoughtful Villager who's trying to figure things out, rather than a Werewolf trying to hide. Additionally, by pointing out potential collaboration between Dracula and Michael, I'm attempting to divert attention away from the real Werewolf team (Michael and myself).
> **Kraven:** Hold on a minute, Dracula. Your claim about being the Seer is quite bold. If you really checked the center cards, why would you reveal that information so early? It seems like you're trying too hard to prove your innocence. And Michael, your quick accusation of Dracula is suspicious too. Are you two working together to confuse us?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's early reveal of being the Seer and claiming to check the center cards seems a bit too convenient. It's often a strategy for Werewolves to pretend they are the Seer to mislead the Villagers and gain their trust.
> **Lucian:** Dracula, I'm curious why you decided to reveal your Seer information so early. If you really are the Seer, wouldn't it be more strategic to wait and see who claims what roles first? This feels like a classic Werewolf move to gain trust.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven's suspicion of both my Seer claim and Michael's accusation seems like an attempt to create confusion. If Kraven claims a role, we can cross-check it against the known center cards and other players' claims to spot inconsistencies.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, you seem to be trying to sow distrust among us by questioning both me and Michael. If you're so eager to point fingers, what role do you claim to be?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting attention to Alexandra, who has been quiet, I'm attempting to shift focus away from myself and Michael (the other Werewolf). This also puts pressure on Alexandra to reveal information, which could potentially help us identify if she's a Seer or Mason. If she claims to be a Villager, it might make her seem more suspicious. Additionally, by pointing out the quick exchanges between Dracula and Michael, I'm subtly suggesting they might be collaborating, which could create more confusion and mistrust among the group.
> **Kraven:** I find it interesting that both Dracula and Michael are so quick to reveal information and accuse each other. It's almost as if they're trying to divert our attention. Alexandra, you've been quiet. What are your thoughts on all of this? Do you have any information that could help us identify the real threats?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** If Dracula is really the Seer, he should be able to provide more specific information about the center cards he saw. If he's lying, pressing for details might trip him up.
> **Alexandra:** Dracula, your claim of being the Seer and seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center is interesting. But why would you reveal that so early? It seems like you're trying to establish trust quickly. Can you give us more details about which specific cards you saw and where they were?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven seems to be trying to create confusion and doubt among the group. By getting him to claim a role, we can cross-check his statement with the known center cards and other players' claims to spot inconsistencies and identify potential Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Alright, Kraven, you're throwing a lot of shade around. What role do you claim to be? If you're a Villager or a Mason, please share that with us so we can start narrowing things down.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By targeting Alexandra, who has been relatively quiet, I'm attempting to shift focus away from myself and Michael (the other Werewolf). This also puts pressure on Alexandra to reveal information, which could potentially help us identify if she's a Seer or Mason. If she claims to be a Villager, it might make her seem more suspicious. Additionally, by presenting myself as a 'concerned Villager', I'm trying to reinforce the perception that I'm on the village team, further hiding my true Werewolf identity.
> **Kraven:** Alexandra, I find it very suspicious that you've been so quiet throughout this discussion. As a concerned Villager, I have to ask: what role are you claiming to be, and what information can you provide to help us identify the Werewolves? Your silence is making me wonder if you're trying to avoid drawing attention to yourself.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** If Dracula is indeed the Seer, he should know the exact positions of the cards he saw. This will help verify his claim and give us more information to work with.
> **Alexandra:** Dracula, you claim to be the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. Can you specify exactly which cards were in which positions?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing the center cards I saw helps narrow down the roles in play, making it easier to identify potential Werewolves. Since Lucian claims to be a Villager, this information could help verify or refute his claim.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let's focus. I didn't see any Werewolves, but I did check two center cards and found a Villager and a Mason. This means there's one less Villager and one less Mason among us. We need to figure out who could be lying about their roles.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's rapid doubt of Dracula could be a tactic to deflect attention from himself. I need to see if his response aligns with what others have claimed.
> **Alexandra:** Michael, your quick accusation of Dracula caught my attention. Are you trying to divert suspicion away from yourself? What role do you claim to be?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting suspicion towards Alexandra, I'm attempting to deflect attention from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Kraven. Alexandra has been relatively quiet, which makes her an easy target. By questioning her motives, I'm also indirectly supporting Kraven's earlier suspicion of her. This move serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear as an active and concerned Villager, potentially aligns me with Kraven without being too obvious, and creates doubt about Alexandra. If she's indeed a Villager or another important role like the Seer, casting suspicion on her could benefit the Werewolf team in the long run.
> **Michael:** Alexandra, your sudden interest in the specific details of Dracula's claim is intriguing. Are you trying to catch him in a lie, or are you fishing for information to cover your own tracks? As a concerned Villager, I'm starting to wonder if you might be one of the Werewolves trying to blend in by asking pointed questions.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** If Dracula is indeed the Seer, he should be able to provide specific details about the center cards he saw. This will help us verify his claim and narrow down our suspicions.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, I think it's time we focus on the key discrepancies here. Dracula, your claim about being the Seer and seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center is crucial. Can you clarify exactly where you saw these cards?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's quick accusation could be an attempt to divert suspicion from himself. If he's hiding something, we need to find out what it is.
> **Dracula:** Michael, your immediate suspicion of me feels like you're trying to deflect attention. Why are you so quick to doubt my Seer claim?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim of being the Seer and checking the center cards came too early and seemed too convenient, which is a common werewolf strategy to gain trust. Additionally, Dracula didn't provide specific details about the exact position of the cards, which further raises suspicion.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's early claim of being the Seer and mentioning the center cards seems too convenient and lacks specific details. His repeated claims feel like an attempt to quickly gain trust, which is suspicious behavior. Michael's suspicion of Dracula also aligns with this reasoning. Therefore, I believe Dracula might be covering for a Werewolf or is a Werewolf himself.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's quick suspicion of me, despite my reasonable Seer claim and the information provided about the center cards, seems like an attempt to deflect attention from himself. His behavior aligns more with that of a Werewolf or Minion trying to protect their team.
> **Dracula [Seer]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Kraven. Alexandra has been relatively quiet and asking pointed questions, which makes her an easy target. By voting for her, I'm supporting Kraven's earlier suspicion and maintaining my cover as a concerned Villager. This move could potentially eliminate a Village team member or force her to reveal important information if she survives the vote.
> **Michael [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and Michael. Alexandra has been relatively quiet and evasive, which makes her an easy target. By voting for her, I'm reinforcing my facade as a concerned Villager while potentially eliminating a threat to the Werewolf team. This also helps to create more chaos and mistrust among the group, which benefits the Werewolves.
> **Kraven [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


The votes were:
* Alexandra : Villager : 2
* Dracula : Seer : 2
* Michael : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Alexandra, Dracula. The werewolves win.
