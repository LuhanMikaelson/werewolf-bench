## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Andrei and Lucian. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Emil. They are thinking about their action.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Knowing another player's exact role can provide strong evidence during the discussion phase. Identifying Dragos' role early will give me better insights into the players' claims and help unearth any contradictions that may arise.


The seer looked at a card from Dragos and saw the card Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I know Dragos is a Villager, I want to see if he confirms his role or if he changes his story, which can help reveal any inconsistencies or potential lies from others.
> **Emil:** Dragos, you seem pretty quiet over there. What role did you have last night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Emil asked me directly about my role, I should answer him truthfully as a Villager. Then, directing the question back at him may help gather more information about his role and intentions. This could help determine if he's a Werewolf or not.
> **Dragos:** Emil, I was a Villager last night. I didn’t have any special abilities or actions. What about you, what role did you have?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** I know Dragos is a Villager, so confirming other roles early on can help us spot contradictions and identify the Werewolves faster.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone, let's try to get to the bottom of this. Mircea, what role did you have last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather more information and see if there are any discrepancies between the players' claims. If too many people claim to be Villagers, it might indicate that someone is lying.
> **Mircea:** Alright Emil, I was a Villager last night too. What I find interesting is that Dragos was quick to claim the same thing. Andrei, what role did you have last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and my partner Lucian. Claiming to be a Villager is a safe bet, as it's a common role. By expressing suspicion towards Emil, who has been asking questions, I'm trying to shift focus away from myself and potentially onto a non-Werewolf player. This could create confusion and help protect my true identity.
> **Andrei:** Well, Mircea, since you're asking, I was also a Villager last night. It's interesting that we have three Villagers already. I'm a bit suspicious of Emil, though. He's been quick to question others but hasn't revealed his own role. Emil, care to share what you were up to last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Dragos and Mircea both claimed Villager, I need to see if Lucian confirms or contradicts this trend. It's important to gather more information before revealing my insights as a Seer.
> **Emil:** Alright, this is getting interesting. Lucian, you’ve been awfully quiet. What role did you have last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and Andrei. By claiming to be a Villager, I'm blending in with the majority. Targeting Emil serves two purposes: it puts pressure on a potential threat (as he hasn't revealed his role yet) and it makes me appear proactive in finding the Werewolves. This strategy allows me to seem helpful to the village while actually working against them.
> **Lucian:** Well, well, well... I find it quite interesting that we have so many Villagers here. As for me, I was also a Villager last night. But I'm starting to get a bit suspicious of Emil. He's been awfully inquisitive without revealing much about himself. Emil, my friend, why are you so eager to question everyone else? Are you perhaps trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** We have too many claims to the Villager role, which means at least one of these claims is false. By pointing this out, we can put pressure on the liars and see who cracks under scrutiny.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Dragos, Mircea, Andrei, and Lucian all claim to be Villagers. That's four Villagers, plus one more if I include myself. But hold on, we only have three Villager cards in this game. Something doesn't add up, and I think someone's lying. Let's dig deeper.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's behavior is suspicious. He's been directing the conversation towards others but hasn't revealed his own role. There's a logical inconsistency with the number of Villager claims, and Emil might be trying to deflect attention from himself.
> **Dragos:** Emil, you've been asking a lot of questions but haven't shared your own role yet. Why don't you tell us what you were last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei's quick accusation of me without any solid reasoning seems suspicious. By questioning him directly, I can see if he cracks under pressure or provides a more detailed explanation, which might expose inconsistencies.
> **Emil:** Alright, Andrei, you've been quick to deflect attention to me. Why are you so eager to point fingers when you haven't provided any substantial evidence yourself? Are you trying to hide something?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and Lucian. By accusing Emil, who has been actively questioning others, I'm attempting to shift the focus onto him. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear proactive and 'helpful' to the village team, it casts doubt on Emil's motivations, and it might make others less likely to suspect me. Additionally, by agreeing with Emil's point about the numbers not adding up, I'm trying to blend in and seem logical, while still turning the argument against him. This approach might also encourage others to reveal more information as they defend themselves, which could be useful for identifying potential targets later.
> **Andrei:** Hold on a minute, everyone. Emil's right about one thing - the numbers don't add up. But I think he's trying to misdirect us. Notice how he's been questioning everyone but hasn't revealed his own role? That's pretty suspicious if you ask me. I'm starting to think Emil might be one of the Werewolves, trying to create chaos and confusion among us Villagers.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** There's a clear contradiction with the number of Villager claims, so questioning Mircea further might help reveal inconsistencies or additional information that can guide us.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, we have a serious inconsistency here. We have four claims to the Villager role, but only three Villager cards in the game. From my perspective, there's definitely a liar among us. Let's start narrowing it down. Mircea, you've been quick to agree with Dragos' Villager claim. Can you provide any additional details or insights that might help us verify your role?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been very active in questioning everyone else's roles but has avoided revealing his own. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate he's trying to hide something. If Emil is indeed a Werewolf or even the Minion, we need to expose him to narrow down our suspects.
> **Mircea:** Emil, you've been very quick to point out inconsistencies and question everyone else without revealing your own role. I find that quite suspicious. You've deflected every time someone asked about your role. What exactly were you last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei has been quick to accuse me without any solid reasoning, which is suspicious behavior. By putting pressure on Andrei, I want to see if he can provide a more detailed explanation or if he starts to crack under scrutiny, revealing himself as a potential Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone, here's what I'm thinking. We have four Villager claims, but only three Villager cards in the game. That means at least one of you is lying. Andrei, you've been pointing fingers at me without providing any real evidence. I think you're trying to create confusion. I'm starting to suspect that you might be a Werewolf.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and my partner Lucian. Emil has been asking a lot of questions and pointing out inconsistencies, which could lead to our discovery. By turning the tables and accusing him of Werewolf-like behavior, I'm attempting to discredit his observations and cast doubt on his motives. This could potentially lead to Emil being voted out, which would be a win for the Werewolf team. Additionally, by reaffirming my 'Villager' role, I'm trying to blend in with the actual Villagers and appear trustworthy.
> **Andrei:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting off track here. Emil's been very clever in directing suspicion towards others, especially me, without revealing anything about himself. That's classic Werewolf behavior. I've been open about my role as a Villager from the start. Emil, on the other hand, has been evasive. I think it's time we put some pressure on him. What do you say, folks? Shouldn't we be more concerned about someone who's trying to control the narrative without contributing any real information?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei has been directing suspicion towards me without revealing any substantial evidence to back up his claims. His eagerness to accuse others, especially me, could be a sign that he's trying to deflect attention from his own role. By putting pressure on him, I hope to see if he cracks under scrutiny or provides any further details that might reveal inconsistencies in his story.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. Andrei, you've been awfully quick to point fingers at me and accuse me of being a Werewolf without providing any solid evidence. I'm starting to think you're trying to shift the blame away from yourself. Care to explain why you're so eager to accuse me?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and my partner Lucian. By addressing Lucian directly, I'm trying to create a sense of camaraderie with him without being too obvious. This also serves to bring Lucian back into the conversation in a way that doesn't put pressure on him, but rather asks for his opinion on Emil. By continuing to cast doubt on Emil, I'm attempting to solidify him as the primary suspect. Additionally, by reaffirming my 'Villager' role and pointing out Emil's evasive behavior, I'm trying to appear more trustworthy to the group.
> **Andrei:** Look, I understand why Emil might be suspicious of me, but let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Emil has been orchestrating this entire conversation, pushing everyone to reveal their roles while conveniently avoiding any questions about his own. That's textbook Werewolf behavior. I've been upfront about being a Villager from the start. Lucian, you've been quiet for a while now. What do you think about Emil's behavior? Don't you find it a bit odd?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Andrei. By targeting Emil, who has been asking many questions without revealing his role, I can appear proactive in finding the Werewolves while actually misdirecting the group. This also aligns with Andrei's previous accusation, potentially strengthening our position as a team. By pressing Emil for his role, I'm putting him in a difficult position - if he claims to be a Villager, it will further complicate the Villager count discrepancy, and if he claims another role, it might make him a target for elimination.
> **Lucian:** I've been observing everyone's behavior, and I must say, I'm growing increasingly suspicious of Emil. He's been orchestrating this entire conversation, pushing everyone to reveal their roles while skillfully avoiding any questions about his own. That's classic Werewolf behavior, isn't it? Emil, why are you so reluctant to share your role with us? What are you hiding?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei's eagerness to accuse me without providing any concrete evidence, combined with the fact that we have too many Villager claims, strongly suggests he might be a Werewolf trying to create confusion and avoid suspicion.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, I've been listening carefully, and it's clear that Andrei is trying to manipulate the conversation by accusing me without any solid evidence. Based on the roles in this game, and knowing that Dragos is definitely a Villager, Andrei's behavior is highly suspicious. I believe Andrei might be a Werewolf trying to deflect attention.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to shift focus away from Emil and myself. By redirecting attention to Mircea, who has been relatively quiet, I'm attempting to create a new target for suspicion. This serves multiple purposes: it takes heat off Emil (who might be the Minion or a valuable distraction), it makes me appear proactive and concerned about finding the truth (like a good Villager would be), and it potentially puts pressure on Mircea, who might reveal valuable information under scrutiny. Additionally, by suggesting that Emil's behavior might be a deliberate distraction, I'm sowing seeds of doubt about the entire direction of the conversation so far, which could help protect both myself and Lucian.
> **Andrei:** Hold on a second, everyone. I think we're all getting a bit too caught up in Emil's tactics. Yes, he's been asking a lot of questions, but what if that's exactly what he wants? To keep us all focused on him while the real threat slips by unnoticed. Mircea, you've been awfully quiet. Care to share your thoughts on all of this?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei has been quick to accuse me without providing solid evidence and has been trying to deflect suspicion away from himself. Additionally, knowing that Dragos is definitely a Villager, the excess Villager claims further point towards Andrei as a potential Werewolf trying to create confusion among us. I believe voting for Andrei will give us the best chance to uncover a Werewolf and win the game for the village team.
> **Emil [Seer]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been orchestrating the conversation and pushing everyone to reveal their roles without revealing his own. Given that there are inconsistencies with the number of Villager claims and his evasive behavior, I suspect he might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us. Voting for him seems like the best option to eliminate a potential threat.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager to increase our chances of winning. Emil has been the most vocal and suspicious of me, making him a threat to our team. By voting for Emil, I'm not only potentially eliminating a villager but also maintaining my cover as a 'concerned Villager' trying to root out the Werewolves. This aligns with my previous strategy of deflecting suspicion onto Emil and could potentially sway other players to vote with me, increasing the chances of Emil's elimination.
> **Andrei [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been very active in questioning others but has avoided revealing his own role. This evasive behavior is highly suspicious and fits the profile of a Werewolf trying to create confusion and deflect attention. Additionally, his claim that Dragos is definitely a Villager despite not having any solid evidence to back it up seems like an attempt to manipulate the situation. Therefore, I believe voting for Emil is the best course of action to uncover the truth.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate potential threats to our team. Emil has been the most vocal and inquisitive player, which makes him dangerous. He's also the only one who hasn't claimed a role, making him an easy target without raising suspicion about my own role. By voting for Emil, I'm aligning with Andrei's accusations, strengthening our position as a team while appearing to act in the village's interest. This move could potentially eliminate a strong player while keeping the focus off of me and my fellow Werewolf.
> **Lucian [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Emil : Seer : 4
* Andrei : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The werewolves win.
