## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Viktor and Selene. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Andrei. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Vladimir. They are thinking about their action.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles that are not in play, which can help me identify potential false claims during the day phase. This information is valuable for deducing who the Werewolves might be.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Selene. By targeting Vladimir, who hasn't been mentioned yet, I can create doubt and confusion among the villagers. This also gives me an opportunity to gauge Vladimir's reaction and potentially identify his role. If he's the Seer or a Mason, putting pressure on him might force him to reveal information that could be useful to the Werewolf team. Additionally, accusing someone else makes me appear more like a concerned villager, which helps maintain my cover.
> **Viktor:** I'm starting to get really suspicious of Vladimir. He's been awfully quiet and evasive. What do you have to say for yourself, Vladimir? Are you hiding something from us?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing my Seer role and the information I gathered about the center cards puts pressure on anyone potentially lying about being the Minion or a Mason. This helps narrow down the suspects and forces the Werewolves or Minion to scramble.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, let's cut to the chase. I am the Seer, and I looked at two center cards last night. I saw the Mason and the Minion. That means anyone claiming to be the Minion or a single Mason is lying. So, anyone want to come clean?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Vladimir's claim of being the Seer. If he's telling the truth, he could be a significant threat to me and Viktor. By questioning his decision to look at center cards instead of player cards, I'm trying to make him seem less credible. This also serves to make me appear as a concerned villager, potentially drawing attention away from myself. Additionally, by engaging with Vladimir's claim, I'm indirectly supporting the idea that there are indeed center cards with those roles, which aligns with what I know as a Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Vladimir, your claim about being the Seer is quite convenient, isn't it? How do we know you're not just trying to throw us off? If you really are the Seer, why didn't you look at any player cards instead of the center? That would have been much more useful information for the village.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to direct the conversation towards Andrei to see if he makes any suspicious claims or statements. This will help us gather more information and potentially identify the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, let's think logically here. Since I saw the Mason and the Minion in the center, we know that anyone claiming to be either of those roles is lying. Viktor, you're accusing me of being evasive, but I just laid out valuable information. If anyone else has something to say about their role, now's the time to speak up. Andrei, you've been quiet so far. What role do you claim to have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As the Mason and knowing the other Mason card is in the center, Vladimir's claim that he saw the Mason and Minion in the center seems suspicious. By challenging Vladimir's claim, I can gauge his reaction and possibly uncover deceit.
> **Andrei:** Vladimir, your claim about the center cards is interesting, but I'm struggling to buy it. If you were really the Seer, looking at two center cards seems like a wasted opportunity. It's more useful to peek at another player's card. Are you sure you're not trying to cover something up?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene's skepticism could be a diversion. By reinforcing my reasoning, I'm putting pressure on her to either reveal what she knows or to slip up if she's bluffing.
> **Vladimir:** Look, Selene, I get that my claim seems convenient, but the reason I looked at the center cards is to clear up confusion about roles that might not even be in play. This way, we can focus on the actual players. If you were the Seer and saw something different, now's the time to speak up.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei has been evading my question about his role, which makes me suspicious. If he doesn't have a solid answer, it might indicate he's hiding something. By pressing him, I hope to force him to either reveal useful information or slip up, which can help us identify if he's a Werewolf.
> **Vladimir:** Andrei, you still haven't told us what role you claim to have. It's important that everyone reveals their roles so we can piece this puzzle together. Are you claiming to be a Villager, or something else?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know the Mason card is indeed in the center, but Vladimir's decision to check two center cards rather than players is a strategic choice that benefits werewolves, as it keeps us from verifying actual player roles. By asking others to confirm or deny seeing the Minion in the center, we might get more insights into Vladimir's true role.
> **Andrei:** Vladimir, your claim about being the Seer and seeing the Mason and Minion in the center is suspicious to me. Since I know the Mason card is in the center, that much aligns. However, your choice to look at two center cards instead of a player's card makes it harder for us to verify your claim. It feels like you're trying to avoid scrutiny. Can anyone else confirm or deny seeing the Minion in the center?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Their skepticism and reluctance to reveal their roles make them suspicious. If they have nothing to hide, they should be able to state their roles clearly. This will help us narrow down who might actually be the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, let's focus on what we know. Selene and Andrei, you've both been questioning me quite a bit. But if we really want to get to the bottom of this, I need you both to state your roles clearly. No more dodging.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei's reluctance to reveal his role is raising red flags for me. If he can't provide a solid answer, it might indicate he's hiding something. By pressing him, I hope to force him to either reveal useful information or slip up, which can help us identify if he's a Werewolf or not.
> **Vladimir:** Alright Andrei, you've been dodging my question about your role for too long. What role do you claim to have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As the Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. This aligns with Vladimir's claim, but his choice to look at the center cards instead of players doesn't help us verify anyone's role. It looks like he's trying to dodge closer scrutiny, which makes me suspect he might be a Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** Vladimir, I find your claim highly suspicious. You want us to believe you're the Seer, yet you chose to look at the center cards rather than any of the players here. That seems like a convenient way to avoid being caught in a lie. To me, it sounds like you're trying to mislead us. Anyone else feel the same?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's accusations and vocal stance could indicate that he's trying to direct attention away from himself. Knowing his claimed role might help us piece together more information about who might be lying.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, you've been quite vocal in pointing fingers at Vladimir. What role are you claiming to have?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and potentially Selene. By turning the tables on Andrei and questioning his evasiveness, I'm attempting to cast doubt on him while simultaneously reinforcing my facade as a concerned Villager. This move also puts pressure on Andrei to reveal his role, which could provide valuable information for the Werewolf team. Additionally, by claiming to be a Villager, I'm establishing a seemingly innocent identity that aligns with the village team's goals, making it less likely for others to suspect me.
> **Viktor:** Whoa, hold on there, Andrei! I find it pretty rich that you're questioning Vladimir's claim when you've been dodging questions about your own role this entire time. If anyone's acting suspicious, it's you. As for me, I'm just a simple Villager trying to figure out what's going on. But I'm starting to think you might be hiding something more sinister. Care to finally share your role with the group, or are you going to keep dancing around the subject?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been very vocal in accusing others without providing much substantial information about his own role. This makes him suspicious and could indicate he's trying to divert attention away from himself. Pressing him to reveal his role will either expose him or help us gather more information.
> **Andrei:** Alright, Viktor, I'm done with your dodging. You've been very quick to point fingers and accuse others, especially Vladimir and now me. I think it's time you come clean about your role. So, Viktor, what's your role?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover as a Villager while simultaneously putting pressure on others. By reiterating my claim as a Villager and turning the spotlight back on Andrei, I'm attempting to deflect suspicion from myself. Andrei's continued evasiveness makes him an easy target, and by pushing him to reveal his role, I might gain valuable information for the Werewolf team. Additionally, this aggressive stance towards Andrei might make me appear more trustworthy to the other players, as I'm actively trying to 'solve' the mystery. This approach also helps to keep the focus off of Selene, my fellow Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** Look, I've already told you that I'm a Villager, Andrei. I'm not dodging anything. What I find suspicious is how you keep deflecting attention away from yourself by constantly questioning others. You still haven't revealed your role, despite multiple people asking. Why is that? Are you afraid of what we might discover? Come on, Andrei, we're all waiting. What's your role?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir’s choice to check the center cards rather than player cards makes it harder to verify his claim and seems like an attempt to avoid closer examination. His behavior and story don't add up, making him the prime suspect in my eyes.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase and address the elephant in the room. Vladimir's claim about being the Seer doesn't sit right with me. He says he looked at the center cards and saw the Mason and Minion, which aligns with my knowledge as the Mason. But why would a true Seer not look at another player's card? To me, it seems like Vladimir is trying to avoid scrutiny and mislead us. I believe Vladimir might be hiding something more sinister, possibly a Werewolf.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to get more information from everyone, and Selene has been deflecting but not sharing. If she's hiding something, it might help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Alright, everyone. We've heard a lot of back and forth between Vladimir, Viktor, and Andrei. Vladimir claims to be the Seer and saw the Mason and Minion in the center. Andrei claims to be the Mason, which matches up with Vladimir's claim. But something doesn't sit right with me. Selene has been questioning Vladimir's claim, which makes sense, but she hasn't revealed much about herself. Selene, what role are you claiming to have?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Viktor. By casting doubt on Andrei and Viktor, I'm attempting to sow discord among the other players. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear as a thoughtful villager, potentially draws attention away from myself, and might lead to the elimination of a non-Werewolf player. I'm also careful not to reveal any specific role for myself, maintaining ambiguity that could be useful later in the game.
> **Selene:** I find it interesting that Andrei suddenly revealed himself as the Mason after dodging questions for so long. It seems awfully convenient, doesn't it? And Viktor, you've been very quick to accuse others, but your claim of being a simple Villager feels a bit too... simple. I think we need to consider the possibility that one or both of you might be Werewolves trying to mislead us.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and onto others. By targeting Selene, my fellow Werewolf, I'm actually trying to make myself appear more trustworthy to the group. It's a risky move, but if Selene plays along and provides a convincing defense, it could strengthen both our positions. Additionally, this puts pressure on Selene to reveal information, which could help us identify potential threats like the Seer or Masons. By taking an aggressive stance against another player, I'm reinforcing my facade as a concerned Villager trying to root out the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** I'm starting to have serious doubts about Selene. She's been very quiet and evasive, only speaking up to cast doubt on others without revealing much about herself. That's classic Werewolf behavior. Selene, why don't you tell us your role and what you did during the night phase? Your silence is becoming very suspicious.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect Viktor's accusation while also casting doubt on him. By questioning his motives for accusing others, I'm attempting to make him look suspicious to the other players. This serves to protect both myself and Viktor (the other Werewolf) by sowing discord among the group. I'm also careful not to reveal my role or provide any specific information about my night actions, maintaining ambiguity that could be useful later in the game. By directing this at Viktor, I'm also indirectly supporting him by engaging with his accusation, which might make us seem less likely to be working together.
> **Selene:** Viktor, your sudden accusation against me is quite rich, considering you've been throwing suspicion around like confetti all game. I've been quiet because I've been observing and trying to piece things together. Unlike you, I don't feel the need to jump at every opportunity to point fingers. But since you're so eager to hear from me, let me ask you this: Why are you so insistent on labeling others as Werewolves? Is it because you're trying to divert attention from yourself?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and Selene. Andrei has been evasive throughout the game and only recently claimed to be a Mason, which aligns with Vladimir's Seer claim. By voting for Andrei, I'm reinforcing my facade as a concerned Villager while potentially eliminating a threat to the Werewolf team. This move also helps to create confusion and discord among the other players, which benefits the Werewolves. Additionally, if Andrei is indeed a Mason, his elimination would weaken the village team's ability to identify the Werewolves.
> **Viktor [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention from myself and Viktor. Voting for Andrei serves multiple purposes: it aligns with my earlier suspicions about him, potentially eliminates a non-Werewolf player, and keeps the focus off Viktor and me. Andrei's late claim of being a Mason after dodging questions earlier makes him a plausible target without raising too much suspicion about my own motivations. This vote also indirectly supports Vladimir's claim about seeing the Mason in the center, which could further confuse the villagers and protect the Werewolf team.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei's reluctance to reveal his role for so long and his late claim of being a Mason raises suspicion. Since I saw the Mason and Minion cards in the center, his claim directly contradicts this information. This suggests he might be trying to mislead us, indicating he could be a Werewolf.
> **Vladimir [Seer]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's claim to be the Seer is suspicious. As the Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center, which aligns with his claim. However, his choice to look at two center cards instead of player cards makes it hard for us to verify his role and seems like a tactic to avoid scrutiny. His behavior points to him possibly being a Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been evasive and hasn't clearly stated her role despite being questioned. This behavior is consistent with how a Werewolf might act to avoid suspicion. Additionally, she has been casting doubt on others without providing concrete information, which seems like an attempt to divert attention away from herself.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Selene.


The votes were:
* Selene : Werewolf : 1
* Vladimir : Seer : 1
* Andrei : Mason : 3



>***GAME:*** Andrei was killed. The werewolves win.
