## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** By asking about the Seer, I can gather information on who might be a Villager, Mason, or Seer themselves. This will help me to protect Selene and Kraven, the Werewolves, by casting suspicion away from them and towards others.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, I think it's time to start narrowing down our suspects. Let's get to the bottom of this! So, I'd like to ask: does anyone want to claim they were the Seer and if so, what did they see?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Alexandra is also a Mason. Hearing from her could help us confirm her role and provide additional credibility to our claims. This will also help us gather more information about the other roles.
> **Lucian:** I want to hear from Alexandra. Alexandra, what did you see or do during the night phase?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know we are both on the village team, and it's important to establish our trust early on. By confirming each other, we can focus on identifying the real Werewolves among Dracula, Selene, and Kraven.
> **Alexandra:** Lucian, I am a Mason and I saw you were the other Mason last night.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** By asking directly about his role, we may be able to gather more information about Dracula's possible alignment and cross-check any inconsistencies in his response.
> **Lucian:** Alright, we have a confirmed Mason pair here, which means Alexandra and I are on the Villager team. Dracula, you asked about the Seer earlier, but you haven't mentioned your own role. Could you tell us what your role is?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I can blend in with the majority and avoid drawing suspicion. Asking Kraven about his role will help me gauge his response and potentially protect Selene and Kraven if he provides a convincing alibi or slips up.
> **Dracula:** Alright Lucian, since you asked, I am a Villager. I was hoping the Seer would step forward and share some useful information to help narrow down the suspects. Right now, I'm inclined to believe that you and Alexandra are indeed Masons, but I'll need more information before I can be sure. On that note, Kraven, what about you? What role do you claim to have?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Selene. By asking Selene about her role, I'm appearing proactive and concerned about finding the Werewolves, which is what a Villager would do. This also gives Selene a chance to claim a role that might help our cause. Additionally, by mentioning the roles others have claimed, I'm showing that I'm paying attention and involved in the game, which makes me seem less suspicious.
> **Kraven:** Well, well, well... isn't this interesting? Alexandra and Lucian claim to be Masons, Dracula says he's a Villager, and I'm starting to see a pattern here. You know what? I think Selene has been awfully quiet. Selene, why don't you tell us what role you have? I'm getting a bit suspicious of your silence.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By claiming to be a Villager and immediately turning the accusation back on Kraven (my fellow Werewolf), I'm attempting to appear innocent while also creating confusion. This move might make others second-guess Kraven's intentions, potentially taking heat off both of us. Additionally, by engaging actively now, I'm countering the 'quiet' accusation, which could have made me seem more suspicious.
> **Selene:** Whoa, hold on there, Kraven! I haven't been quiet; I've been carefully listening to everyone's claims. Since you're so eager to hear from me, I'll tell you that I'm a Villager. Now, I find it interesting that you're so quick to point fingers. Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself? Because I'm starting to wonder if you might be hiding something.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting the suspicion back to Selene and involving Dracula, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm distancing myself from suspicion by acting proactively against a 'potential Werewolf', 2) I'm creating doubt about Selene's claim, which could help protect her if others start to suspect her, 3) I'm engaging Dracula, who claimed to be a Villager, to appear as if I'm collaborating with the Village team. This move also allows me to gauge Dracula's reaction, which could give me more information about his true role and how to proceed in the game.
> **Kraven:** Well, Selene, that's quite the defensive response! I wasn't trying to point fingers; I was simply curious about your role since everyone else had shared. But now that you mention it, your reaction does seem a bit... overblown. Are you sure you're just a Villager? Because that's exactly what a Werewolf might say when they're cornered. Dracula, what do you think about Selene's response? Does it strike you as suspicious too?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** Kraven's aggressive questioning and attempt to cast suspicion on Selene seem like tactics to deflect from his own role. By accusing Kraven, I aim to draw attention away from Selene and create doubt about Kraven's intentions, protecting the Werewolves, Selene and Kraven, in the process.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, you're casting suspicions on Selene who has claimed to be a Villager, just like me. This feels like a classic tactic to deflect attention away from yourself. I think you're trying to create confusion and chaos, which makes me suspect you might be hiding something. Everyone, I think Kraven is the real Werewolf here.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By turning Dracula's accusation back on him, I'm attempting to shift suspicion away from myself while also creating doubt about his claimed Villager role. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear more innocent by actively engaging in discussion and logical deduction, it potentially protects Selene (my fellow Werewolf) by redirecting attention away from her, and it sows discord among the Village team. Additionally, by pointing out the discrepancy in the claimed roles, I'm subtly hinting that one of the Masons might be lying, which could further fracture the Village team's unity.
> **Kraven:** Whoa, hold on there, Dracula! You're twisting my words and actions. I was simply trying to get everyone involved in the discussion, including Selene who hadn't spoken yet. If anything, your quick jump to accuse me seems more suspicious. Let's think about this logically - we have two claimed Masons, two claimed Villagers, and me. The numbers don't add up. Someone's lying, and I think it might be you, Dracula. What do you say to that?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** Kraven's aggressive behavior and attempts to cast suspicion on others make him appear to be hiding something. By questioning his transparency, I'm aiming to cast doubt on his intentions and protect Selene and Kraven, the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let's step back and think this through. Alexandra and Lucian claim to be the Masons, and that seems to be credible. Selene and I claim to be Villagers. Now Kraven, I can't help but notice how aggressively you've been pushing on Selene and now me. It seems like you're trying to sow confusion and deflect attention away from yourself. Why haven't you been more transparent about your own role?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By turning Dracula's accusation back on him and pointing out inconsistencies in his behavior, I'm attempting to shift suspicion away from myself while also creating doubt about his claimed Villager role. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear more innocent by actively engaging in discussion and logical deduction, it potentially protects Selene (my fellow Werewolf) by redirecting attention away from her, and it sows discord among the Village team. Additionally, by questioning Dracula's motives and actions, I'm subtly suggesting that he might be the Werewolf or even the Minion, which could further fracture the Village team's unity and take the focus off of me.
> **Kraven:** Hold on a second, Dracula. You're asking why I haven't been transparent about my role, but let's not forget that you were the one who first asked if anyone was the Seer without revealing your own role. It wasn't until Lucian pressed you that you claimed to be a Villager. That seems pretty suspicious to me. And now you're trying to paint me as the aggressor? I've been trying to get to the truth, which is exactly what a loyal villager would do. I think everyone here needs to take a good, hard look at Dracula's behavior. He's been subtly manipulating the conversation from the start.


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** By addressing Selene directly and reinforcing her claim as a Villager, I aim to create a stronger bond with her and further discredit Kraven. This helps protect Selene and Kraven, who are the Werewolves, by creating doubt about Kraven's intentions and diverting attention away from them.
> **Dracula:** Selene, you've claimed to be a Villager, just like me. But Kraven seems to be really insistent on casting suspicion on you, which makes me think he's trying to deflect. I think it's important for us to stick together and question his motives. What do you think about Kraven's behavior so far?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover as a Villager while also deflecting suspicion. By appearing to consider all possibilities and asking for input from the claimed Masons, I'm trying to present myself as a rational, team-oriented player. This approach also allows me to subtly cast doubt on Kraven without directly accusing him, which could help protect my fellow Werewolf if the group starts to suspect him. Additionally, by engaging the Masons, I'm attempting to gather more information that could be useful in identifying potential threats to the Werewolf team.
> **Selene:** Dracula, I appreciate your support, but I think we need to be careful about jumping to conclusions too quickly. Kraven's behavior is definitely suspicious, but let's not forget that we still don't know his role. What if he's the Seer and is trying to gather information? That said, his aggressive questioning does make me uneasy. Alexandra and Lucian, as our claimed Masons, what are your thoughts on this situation? Do you find Kraven's behavior as odd as Dracula and I do?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Kraven. By shifting focus to Dracula and asking the claimed Masons for their opinion, I'm attempting to create doubt about Dracula while also appearing to be a concerned Villager. This move also helps to validate the Masons' claim, which could make them less likely to suspect me. Additionally, by engaging Alexandra directly, I'm trying to gather more information that could be useful in identifying potential threats to the Werewolf team.
> **Selene:** You know, the more I think about it, the more suspicious Dracula seems. He was quick to accuse Kraven, but he hasn't really given us any solid information. Alexandra, Lucian, you two claim to be Masons. Have either of you noticed anything odd about Dracula's behavior? I'm starting to wonder if he might be trying to manipulate us all.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly asking Kraven about his role, we can either catch him in a lie or force him to reveal his true role. His behavior has been quite suspicious, and if he is indeed the Seer or another role, this would clarify things. Otherwise, this could confirm our suspicions about him being a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Kraven, you have been dodging the question about your role for quite some time. You've been quick to cast suspicion on Selene and now on Dracula. I think it's high time you come clean and tell us what role you actually have.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Seer, I'm attempting to establish credibility and shift suspicion away from myself. The information about the center cards is a lie, but it's believable and hard to disprove. This claim also explains my previous questioning behavior as an attempt to gather information. By mentioning the suspiciousness of Dracula and Selene, I'm maintaining my previous stance while also providing a reason for my earlier accusations. This move is risky, but it could potentially save both me and Selene if executed well.
> **Kraven:** Alright, Alexandra, you want me to come clean? Fine. I'm the Seer. I didn't want to reveal this earlier because I was trying to gather more information, but now I feel I have to. During the night, I looked at two center cards and saw a Werewolf and a Villager. This means there's still one Werewolf among us. I've been trying to figure out who it might be based on everyone's behavior. Dracula's quick accusations and Selene's defensive responses have been particularly suspicious to me. What do you all make of this information?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By shifting suspicion onto Alexandra, I'm attempting to create doubt about the Mason pair, which could fracture the village team's unity. This also takes the heat off me and Selene, while still appearing to be actively engaged in finding the Werewolves. By questioning Alexandra directly, I'm putting her on the defensive, which might make her seem more suspicious to others. This move also indirectly challenges Lucian's credibility without directly accusing him, potentially sowing more discord among the villagers.
> **Kraven:** Hold on a second, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in accusations without looking at the bigger picture. Alexandra and Lucian claim to be Masons, which means they should be trustworthy. But have we considered that one of them might be lying? If one of them is actually a Werewolf, it would explain why we're having such a hard time figuring this out. Alexandra, you've been awfully quick to demand answers from others. Are you really a Mason, or are you just trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven has been avoiding revealing his role, and his late claim of being the Seer feels like a desperate attempt to avoid suspicion. His behavior throughout the discussion has been erratic and accusatory, which is typical of someone trying to deflect attention away from themselves. By calling him out, we can focus our efforts on eliminating a potential Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Kraven, your sudden claim of being the Seer after so much dodging is highly suspicious. If you were really the Seer, you should have revealed useful information earlier. Instead, you're trying to cast doubt on those of us who have been clear from the start. I believe you are the Werewolf trying to mislead us.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By shifting focus to Lucian, I'm attempting to create doubt about the Mason pair, which could fracture the village team's unity. This also takes the heat off me and Selene, while still appearing to be actively engaged in finding the Werewolves. By questioning Lucian directly, I'm putting him on the defensive, which might make him seem more suspicious to others. This move also indirectly challenges Alexandra's credibility without directly accusing her again, potentially sowing more discord among the villagers.
> **Kraven:** Listen, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in personal accusations and losing sight of the bigger picture. We need to focus on the facts. We have two claimed Masons, two claimed Villagers, and me, the Seer. Something doesn't add up here. I suspect one of our so-called Masons might be a Werewolf in disguise. It's a clever tactic - claim a trusted role early and then sit back while others fight. Lucian, you've been awfully quiet. Care to explain why you're letting Alexandra do all the talking for your supposed Mason duo?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** Kraven and I have been actively discussing roles and gathering information, while Lucian has been relatively quiet and letting Alexandra speak for their Mason duo. This could be a clever tactic to avoid suspicion. By voting for Lucian, I aim to protect the Werewolves, Selene and Kraven, and create doubt about the integrity of the claimed Masons.
> **Dracula [Minion]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's behavior has been suspicious throughout the discussion. He dodged questions about his role for a long time and only claimed to be the Seer when pressed. This last-minute revelation seems like a desperate attempt to deflect suspicion. Additionally, his attempt to cast doubt on the confirmed Masons suggests he's trying to create confusion. Given the information available, I believe Kraven is likely a Werewolf and should be voted out.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate villagers without raising suspicion. Alexandra has been vocal and seems trusted by others, making her a threat to the Werewolf team. By voting for her, I'm attempting to remove a strong villager while also potentially sowing discord between the claimed Masons. This could create enough confusion to protect both Kraven and myself in future rounds. Additionally, voting for Alexandra instead of Dracula (who I previously cast suspicion on) makes me appear less predictable and potentially more trustworthy to the other players.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate villagers. Alexandra has been the most vocal against me, potentially swaying others. By voting for her, I'm maintaining my false Seer claim and sowing doubt about the Mason pair. This could fracture the village team and protect both me and Selene. It's a strategic move to eliminate a strong villager while appearing to act in the village's interest.
> **Kraven [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's late claim of being the Seer after avoiding revealing his role for so long is highly suspicious. His erratic and accusatory behavior throughout the discussion suggests he is trying to deflect attention away from himself. I believe he is the Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Alexandra [Mason]:** I am voting for Kraven.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Mason : 1
* Kraven : Werewolf : 2
* Alexandra : Mason : 2



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Kraven, Alexandra. The villagers win.
