## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Larisa and Radu. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Viktor. They are aware they are the only mason in play.

There is one seer in play, Semira. They are thinking about their action.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me a broader understanding of what roles might still be in play and help deduce the roles of other players more accurately.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and Radu. Viktor hasn't been mentioned yet, so he's a good target. By accusing him, I appear proactive and concerned about finding the Werewolves, which helps maintain my cover as a Villager. This also puts pressure on Viktor to defend himself, potentially revealing information about his role that we can use to our advantage. If he's a Seer or Mason, identifying him as such would be valuable for the Werewolf team.
> **Larisa:** I'm starting to get really suspicious of Viktor. He's been awfully quiet and hasn't contributed much to our discussions. That's exactly what a Werewolf would do to avoid drawing attention to themselves. What do you have to say for yourself, Viktor?


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa’s accusation seems quite sudden and lacks concrete evidence. Before we make any rash decisions, it's important to gather more information. Radu hasn't spoken up much, so his input could be valuable in understanding the bigger picture.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's not get hasty here. I think it's crucial for us to hear from Radu next. Radu, what role do you claim to have and what did you observe during the night?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Larisa. By claiming to be a Villager, I'm taking a safe, neutral stance. I'm also subtly supporting Larisa's suspicion of Viktor, which helps to create division among the non-Werewolf players. By suggesting that Viktor might be worried about a Seer, I'm indirectly implying that he might have something to hide, further casting suspicion on him. This approach allows me to appear cooperative while actually misdirecting the group.
> **Radu:** Hold on a second, Viktor. I think you're trying to deflect attention from yourself by putting me on the spot. As for my role, I'm a simple Villager. I didn't observe anything during the night because Villagers don't wake up. But I find it interesting that you're so eager to hear from me. Are you perhaps worried that I might have seen something as a Seer? Larisa might be onto something about your suspicious behavior.


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** Radu's deflection and lack of concrete information make his villager claim seem less trustworthy. By pressing him, I aim to gather more insight into his true role and intentions. Additionally, questioning his view on Larisa's accusation can reveal potential alliances or inconsistencies.
> **Viktor:** Radu, I think you're deflecting a bit too much. Claiming to be a simple Villager without any solid information doesn't help us at all. If you really are a Villager, you should be more proactive in helping us root out the Werewolf. What do you think about Larisa's sudden accusation against me? Is it based on any concrete observations or just a random hunch?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to shift attention away from myself and Larisa. By questioning Emil, who hasn't spoken yet, I'm appearing proactive and helpful to the village while actually creating more confusion. This also gives me a chance to potentially identify the Seer or other important roles based on Emil's response. If Emil claims to have seen something, it could make them a target for elimination. If they claim to be a Villager, it adds another layer of complexity for the group to sort through, buying more time for the Werewolves.
> **Radu:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting sidetracked here. Viktor's right that we need more concrete information, but let's not forget that Larisa was the first to cast suspicion. Semira and Emil have been awfully quiet. Emil, you haven't said a word yet. What's your take on all this? Did you notice anything suspicious during the night phase?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been deflecting accusations and directing attention away from himself. Pressing him for concrete reasons might reveal inconsistencies in his story.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, let's not get too hasty. I think Viktor's quick dismissal of Larisa's suspicion is worth noting. Viktor, can you give us some specific reasons why you think Larisa is wrong, and why should we not suspect you?


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's sudden accusation without providing any solid information is suspicious. By pressing him for details, we can either expose inconsistencies or gain valuable insight into his role and intentions. Emil's response could help clarify whether he has any hidden agenda or if he genuinely has information to share.
> **Viktor:** Emil, it seems like you're quick to jump on me without much evidence. I've been trying to gather more information, while you've been sitting quietly. What exactly did you see or hear during the night phase that makes you so confident in suspecting me?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's initial response was to claim Villager and then quickly move the focus back to Viktor. This could be an attempt to deflect suspicion from himself. By pressing Radu for more details, we might catch him in a contradiction or gain more insight into his true role.
> **Emil:** Radu, you said you're a simple Villager, but I'm curious about something. If you're so sure Viktor is deflecting, why didn't you push harder on him earlier? It seems like you're trying to stay in the background while throwing subtle accusations. Can you give us more insights on why you're so confident Viktor is suspicious?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and create doubt about other players. By turning Emil's question back on him, I'm attempting to shift the focus away from me and onto Emil. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear more proactive and less suspicious, it potentially puts pressure on Emil to reveal information about his role (which could be useful for the Werewolves), and it creates more confusion and discord among the non-Werewolf players. Additionally, by subtly implying that Emil's behavior is suspicious, I'm sowing seeds of doubt that could be useful later in the game.
> **Radu:** Wait a minute, Emil. You're suddenly very interested in my actions and motivations. Why the sudden focus on me? I've been trying to contribute to the discussion and gather information, just like everyone else. If you're so keen on questioning others, what about you? You've been awfully quiet until now, and then you jump straight into accusing Viktor and me. That seems pretty suspicious to me. What's your role, and what did you actually see or do during the night phase?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's defensive behavior when questioned about his role raises suspicion. By pressing him for specific reasons on why he thinks Viktor is suspicious, we may catch him in a contradiction or gather more insight into his true intentions. This will help us identify the Werewolves more effectively.
> **Emil:** Radu, you're accusing me of being suspicious for questioning you and Viktor, but isn't that what we should be doing? You claimed to be a simple Villager, but your defensive reaction when asked for more details is concerning. Can you provide any specific reasons why you think Viktor is suspicious, aside from just deflecting attention away from yourself?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue deflecting suspicion away from myself and Larisa. By addressing Emil's question and providing a reasonable explanation for my suspicion of Viktor, I maintain my cover as a helpful Villager. However, the real strategy here is to shift focus onto Semira, who has been quiet. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me, potentially exposes information about Semira's role (which could be useful for the Werewolves), and creates more confusion among the non-Werewolf players. If Semira claims a powerful role like Seer, it makes them a target for elimination. If they claim to be a Villager, it adds another layer of complexity for the group to sort through, buying more time for the Werewolves. Additionally, by appearing to be proactive in questioning others, I continue to present myself as a helpful Villager while actually working against the village's interests.
> **Radu:** Look, I understand everyone's on edge, but we're getting nowhere by throwing accusations around without solid evidence. Emil, I'm not being defensive, I'm just trying to understand why you're suddenly so interested in me when I've been consistently trying to help the village. The reason I find Viktor suspicious is his early attempt to deflect attention onto me and his lack of substantial contribution to identifying the Werewolves. But you know what? I think we're overlooking someone here. Semira has been incredibly quiet throughout this entire discussion. Semira, what's your take on all of this? Do you have any insights that could help us identify the Werewolves?


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing that the Minion and one Mason are in the center, I can narrow down the roles in play and challenge Viktor's behavior, which has been unusually aggressive and deflecting. This encourages more focused discussion and helps us identify the Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Everyone, I've been observing our discussions, and I think it's time we make some progress. I looked at two cards in the center, and I can confirm that the Minion and one of the Masons are there. This means neither the Minion nor one of the Mason cards are in play. Considering that, Viktor and Radu have been deflecting a lot, which makes me suspicious. Viktor, you've been putting a lot of pressure on Radu. Why are you so intent on targeting him?


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira's information confirms that the Minion and one Mason card are in the center, which supports my knowledge as a Mason. Emil has been accusing others without providing solid evidence, and it's time to press him for more information to either confirm his innocence or expose his deceit.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone, let's focus on the facts here. Semira mentioned that she saw the Minion and one of the Masons in the center, which aligns with my knowledge that the other Mason card is in the center. This means that we should focus on players who might be Werewolves. Emil, you've been pushing a lot of suspicion but without any solid evidence. What role do you claim to have, and can you provide us with any concrete information from the night phase?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's claim is quite significant since it rules out the Minion and one Mason. It's important to verify her information and understand why she didn't share it earlier. This could help us narrow down the Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Semira, you mentioned seeing the Minion and one of the Masons in the center. Can you confirm which specific Mason card you saw, and why haven't you spoken up earlier with this crucial information?


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil has been deflecting and questioning others aggressively, which could be a tactic to hide his true role. Knowing his role might give us a clearer picture of who the Werewolves are.
> **Semira:** Emil, you seem very eager to probe into everyone's roles without giving us much about yourself. What role do you claim to have, and can you provide us with any concrete information from the night phase?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's information about the center cards is crucial and could help us narrow down our suspects. Understanding why she didn't share this earlier might reveal more about her role and intentions.
> **Emil:** Semira, you mentioned seeing the Minion and one of the Masons in the center. Can you confirm which specific Mason card you saw, and why haven't you spoken up earlier with this crucial information?


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil's aggressive questioning and deflecting behavior could be a tactic to hide his true role. By pressing him to reveal his role and observations, we might be able to get closer to identifying the Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Emil, you're doing a lot of deflecting and probing into everyone's roles without revealing much about yourself. What role do you claim to have, and what did you observe during the night phase?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's claim significantly impacts our understanding of the roles in play. By questioning Viktor's alignment with Semira's statement, we can potentially reveal inconsistencies and identify if he's a Werewolf trying to blend in.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and consider what we've heard so far. Semira claims to have seen the Minion and one of the Mason cards in the center, which means those roles are not in play. This matches up with Viktor's statement about the other Mason card being in the center. If we believe Semira, then Viktor might be trying to align his story with hers to gain credibility. But Viktor has been deflecting attention a lot. Viktor, why should we trust your claim about the Mason card in the center?


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's evasiveness and sudden accusations without solid proof are suspicious. Pressing him for his role and detailed information might expose his true intentions or clear up doubts.
> **Viktor:** Alright folks, we need to focus. Based on what Semira has revealed about the Minion and one Mason card being in the center, and my own knowledge that the other Mason card is indeed in the center, it aligns with the facts. Emil, you've been dodging and probing without giving us much yourself. What role do you claim to have, and why should we trust you?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's claim significantly impacts our understanding of the roles in play. By questioning her timing and reasoning, we can potentially reveal inconsistencies and determine if she's being truthful or trying to mislead us. This will help us narrow down our suspects.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, let's take a moment to regroup. We've heard a lot of claims and accusations, but we need to piece together the information logically. Semira claims to have seen the Minion and a Mason in the center, which aligns with our understanding that the Minion is out of play. Viktor has been deflecting a lot of suspicion, and Radu has been somewhat defensive. We need to focus on the inconsistencies. Semira, can you provide any specific reasons why you waited until now to share what you saw in the center?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and Radu. Viktor has been a target of suspicion throughout the game, and voting for him helps maintain my cover as a concerned villager. By eliminating Viktor, we remove a potential threat to the Werewolf team, especially if he turns out to be the Seer or a Mason. This vote also aligns with my earlier accusation, making my actions appear consistent and less suspicious.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil has been the most evasive and accusatory without providing solid evidence or revealing his role. Semira's information about the Minion and Mason in the center aligns with my knowledge as a Mason, suggesting Emil is likely trying to deflect suspicion and might be a Werewolf.
> **Viktor [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor has been very aggressive and deflecting throughout the discussions. This behavior is suspicious and aligns with the tactics a Werewolf might use to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Additionally, my revelation that the Minion and one Mason are in the center, along with Viktor's claim that the other Mason is in the center, could be Viktor's attempt to align his story with mine to gain credibility. Therefore, I believe voting for Viktor is the best choice to help the village win.
> **Semira [Seer]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention from myself and Larisa. Emil has been consistently questioning others without providing much information about himself. By voting for Emil, I'm reinforcing the suspicion I've been trying to cast on him throughout the game. This move also aligns with the general suspicion towards Emil expressed by other players, making my vote seem less suspicious. Additionally, eliminating Emil could potentially remove a villager or a powerful role like the Seer, which would benefit the Werewolf team. This vote allows me to appear as if I'm trying to help the village while actually working towards the Werewolves' victory.
> **Radu [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been deflecting suspicion and focusing on others without providing concrete evidence. His behavior aligns with that of a Werewolf trying to avoid detection. Semira's claim about the center cards reduces the likelihood of the Minion being in play, and Radu's defensive stance seems more like that of a confused Villager. Viktor, on the other hand, has been consistently trying to redirect attention, which is suspicious.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


The votes were:
* Viktor : Mason : 3
* Emil : Villager : 2



>***GAME:*** Viktor was killed. The werewolves win.
