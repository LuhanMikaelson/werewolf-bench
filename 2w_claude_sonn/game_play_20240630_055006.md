## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Vladimir and Ileana. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Selene. They are thinking about their action.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me a better idea of the roles that are not in play, which can help narrow down who might be lying during the day. This will also allow me to potentially confirm or refute other players’ claims about their roles.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** The Seer can provide crucial information that will help us identify the Werewolves or confirm the roles of other players, making it easier for us to strategize and find the Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, let's start by figuring out who might have some useful information. Can anyone claim to be the Seer? We really need to know what they saw during the night.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By suggesting caution about Seer claims, I'm setting the stage to potentially discredit any real Seer who might expose me later. Claiming to be a Villager is a safe, neutral stance that doesn't draw too much attention. I'm also trying to encourage others to reveal information that could be useful to the Werewolf team.
> **Vladimir:** I'm afraid I can't claim to be the Seer, Cristina. But I do think we should be cautious about anyone who does make that claim too quickly. In my experience, real Seers often hesitate to reveal themselves right away to avoid becoming a target. What if we start by sharing what roles we're comfortable revealing? I, for one, am a simple Villager.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert suspicion away from myself and Vladimir. By claiming to be a Mason, I'm presenting myself as part of the village team while also explaining why I don't have a partner to verify my claim. This also allows me to cast doubt on Vladimir's Villager claim without directly accusing him, maintaining our secret alliance. By questioning Cristina's eagerness to find the Seer, I'm attempting to shift suspicion onto her and away from the Werewolves. This approach allows me to appear proactive and helpful to the village while secretly working against their interests.
> **Ileana:** I appreciate your caution, Vladimir, but I think we need to be more proactive in our approach. As someone who's played this game quite a few times, I've noticed that Werewolves often try to blend in by claiming to be Villagers. It's an easy role to claim without much scrutiny. I'm actually a Mason, and I didn't see another Mason during the night phase. This means the other Mason card is likely in the center. Cristina, you seemed eager to find the Seer. Are you perhaps hiding something by deflecting attention?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to prompt Vladimir to provide more information or slip up in his reasoning, helping us identify any inconsistencies or signs of deceit.
> **Cristina:** Ileana, I'm intrigued by your claim of being a Mason and not seeing another Mason. If you're telling the truth, that does narrow things down a bit. But I wonder, if the other Mason card is indeed in the center, which roles might the other players be holding? Vladimir, you said you're a Villager. Can you tell us why you believe that, and do you have any suspicions so far?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Ileana. By questioning Cristina's motives and accusing her of potentially being a Werewolf, I'm creating doubt about her and shifting focus away from me and Ileana. This also helps to sow discord among the Villagers, making it harder for them to unite against the Werewolves. Additionally, by reaffirming my 'Villager' claim, I'm trying to appear transparent and trustworthy.
> **Vladimir:** Cristina, I appreciate your interest in finding the Seer, but I find it a bit suspicious that you're so eager to identify them. As for why I believe I'm a Villager, it's simple - that's the card I was dealt. I don't have any special abilities to report. Now, regarding suspicions, I'm actually quite concerned about you, Cristina. You haven't revealed your role yet, and you seem very keen on exposing others. Are you perhaps a Werewolf trying to identify the Seer early to eliminate them?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene and Emil have been quiet so far, and we need more information from them to make a better judgment. Focusing on them might help us identify any discrepancies or confirm roles more effectively.
> **Cristina:** Ileana, I find your claim about being a Mason interesting, and it could indeed help narrow things down. But I'm curious about Selene and Emil, who haven't spoken much yet. If you two could share what roles you're comfortable revealing, it would help us piece together more information.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to push Cristina to reveal her role because her behavior is suspicious, and it will help us narrow down the possibilities. Ileana's claim as a Mason checks out, so we can consider her an ally for now.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, I have some information that could really help us out. During the night, I saw two of the center cards, and they were Mason and Villager. This means Ileana is telling the truth about being a Mason, and there's one less Villager card in play for someone to claim. Cristina, you've been pressing hard to find the Seer, and it's making me suspicious. What's your role?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's information aligns with Ileana's claim, reducing some uncertainty. Focusing on Vladimir, who might be trying to fly under the radar, could help us uncover inconsistencies and identify a potential Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Selene, your claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center is interesting and adds credibility to Ileana's story. However, I'm starting to get suspicious of Vladimir. He was quick to deflect and hasn't provided much useful information, which can be a common tactic for Werewolves trying to blend in. What do you all think?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's persistent effort to find the Seer is suspicious and could indicate that she's trying to identify and eliminate an important role for the Werewolves. Pressing her on this might reveal more about her true intentions.
> **Selene:** Cristina, you've been very vocal about wanting to find the Seer, and that's making me suspicious. Why are you so eager to identify the Seer? Are you trying to find them to eliminate them as a Werewolf would?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene and Ileana have provided some valuable information, and Vladimir has been deflecting. We need to hear from Emil to piece together the remaining puzzle. His response could either help us uncover inconsistencies or confirm suspicions.
> **Cristina:** Emil, you've been awfully quiet. What role do you claim to have, and do you have any insights or suspicions so far?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to challenge Cristina because her behavior has been suspiciously focused on finding the Seer, which is something a Werewolf might do to eliminate a key village role.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone. Let's think this through carefully. Ileana claimed to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason. Selene said she saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, which supports Ileana's claim. Therefore, Ileana's story seems credible. However, we still need to figure out who the Werewolves are. Cristina, you've been pushing hard to find the Seer, which does make me suspicious. Why are you so eager to identify the Seer? Are you trying to find them to eliminate them as a Werewolf?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** By putting pressure on Vladimir, we might uncover inconsistencies or force him to reveal more information. His behavior so far has been evasive, which is often a tactic used by Werewolves trying to avoid detection.
> **Cristina:** Selene, your claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center aligns well with Ileana's statement, but I still think there's something off about Vladimir. He was quick to deflect and hasn't provided much useful information. Vladimir, can you explain why you haven't been more forthcoming and are quick to cast suspicion on others?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover as a Villager while deflecting suspicion. By turning Cristina's accusations back on her, I'm attempting to discredit her and make her seem like the suspicious one. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me, potentially eliminates a threat if she is indeed the Seer or another powerful role, and sows discord among the Villagers. Additionally, by reaffirming my 'Villager' claim and presenting it as openness, I'm trying to appear more trustworthy to the group.
> **Vladimir:** Whoa, hold on a second! Cristina, you're really pushing hard to paint me as suspicious, but let's take a step back and look at the facts. I've been open about my role from the start - I'm a Villager. I haven't been 'quick to cast suspicion' as you claim; I've simply been sharing my observations, which is exactly what we should all be doing. Now, you've been relentlessly pushing to find the Seer and deflecting attention onto others when questioned. That's classic Werewolf behavior. Why don't you tell us your role and explain why you've been so aggressive in your questioning?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir has been deflecting and hasn't provided concrete information, which makes me suspicious. Pressuring him might reveal inconsistencies or force him to share more useful information.
> **Cristina:** Vladimir, you've been very defensive and quick to cast suspicion on me. If you're really a Villager, why haven't you tried to provide more useful information or insights? It feels like you're trying to deflect attention away from yourself.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Ileana. By targeting Emil, who has been quiet, I'm creating a new target for the group's suspicion. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me and Ileana, potentially eliminates a threat if Emil is indeed a powerful role like the Seer, and continues to sow discord among the Villagers. Additionally, by recapping the information shared by others, I'm trying to appear helpful and engaged, further cementing my facade as a Villager.
> **Vladimir:** Listen, everyone. I think we're getting sidetracked here. Cristina keeps pushing suspicion onto me, but let's look at the bigger picture. Selene claimed to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, which supports Ileana's claim of being a Mason. That leaves us with one Werewolf card and one other card in the center. Emil has been suspiciously quiet throughout this discussion. Emil, why haven't you shared your role or contributed more to the conversation? Are you perhaps trying to avoid attention because you're hiding something?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's behavior has been consistently focused on finding the Seer, which is something a Werewolf might do to eliminate a key village role. This aggressive behavior doesn't align well with a Villager's role and needs to be questioned further.
> **Emil:** Cristina, your aggressive questioning and eagerness to find the Seer is really making me suspicious. Why are you so focused on identifying the Seer?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's repeated deflections and lack of useful information make me suspicious. Pressuring him to respond to the specific claims made by Ileana and Selene might reveal inconsistencies or force him to explain himself more clearly.
> **Cristina:** Vladimir, you've been deflecting suspicion back onto me every time I press for more information. If you're really a Villager, you should be helping us find the Werewolves, not just defending yourself. What do you think about Ileana and Selene's claims? Are you willing to consider that they're telling the truth, and if so, why are you so focused on me?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Ileana. By targeting Emil, who has been quiet, I'm creating a new target for the group's suspicion. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me and Ileana, potentially eliminates a threat if Emil is indeed a powerful role like the Seer, and continues to sow discord among the Villagers. Additionally, by focusing on Emil's lack of participation, I'm positioning myself as an active and engaged player, which aligns with my facade as a Villager trying to find the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** I think we're overlooking something important here. Emil has been suspiciously quiet throughout this entire discussion. Emil, why haven't you shared your role or contributed more to the conversation? Your silence is making me wonder if you're trying to avoid attention because you're hiding something. Are you perhaps one of the Werewolves?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir has been deflecting suspicion and hasn't provided much useful information. This behavior is raising my suspicions, and we need to get a clearer understanding of his role and motivations.
> **Emil:** Vladimir, you've been quick to deflect suspicion onto Cristina and now onto me. If you're really a Villager, why haven't you tried to provide more useful information or insights? It feels like you're trying to deflect attention away from yourself. What role do you claim to have again, and why should we believe you?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to keep deflecting suspicion away from myself and Ileana. By directly accusing Emil, who has been quiet, I'm creating a strong target for the group's suspicion. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me and Ileana, potentially eliminates a threat if Emil is indeed a powerful role like the Seer, and continues to sow discord among the Villagers. By mentioning the possibility of Emil being the Minion, I'm also subtly introducing doubt about his allegiance without directly accusing him of being a Werewolf, which could be useful if he is indeed the Minion. Additionally, by reiterating my 'Villager' claim and presenting myself as actively trying to find the Werewolves, I'm reinforcing my facade as a helpful Villager.
> **Vladimir:** Look, I've been transparent from the start about being a Villager. I'm trying to help us find the Werewolves, which is why I've been asking questions and sharing my thoughts. Emil, on the other hand, has barely said anything this entire game. That's extremely suspicious behavior. Are you a Werewolf, Emil? Or maybe the Minion trying to stay under the radar?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir has been deflecting suspicion and hasn't provided any useful or concrete information. Both Ileana and Selene's claims seem credible, reducing the pool of potential Werewolves. Vladimir's behavior fits that of someone trying to avoid detection as a Werewolf.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate potential threats. Emil has been suspiciously quiet throughout the game, making him an easy target. By voting for Emil, I'm reinforcing my facade as a Villager trying to find the Werewolves, while potentially eliminating a powerful role like the Seer or a Villager. This also helps protect my fellow Werewolf, Ileana, by keeping suspicion away from us.
> **Vladimir [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and Vladimir. Cristina has been very vocal and pushing hard to find the Seer, which makes her an easy target. By voting for her, I can appear to be supporting the village's interests while actually protecting myself and my fellow Werewolf. This also aligns with Vladimir's accusations against her, strengthening our secret alliance without appearing too obvious. Additionally, eliminating Cristina could potentially remove a strong village player, improving our chances of winning.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina has been overly eager to identify the Seer, which is suspicious behavior. If she were a Villager, she would likely be more focused on gathering information rather than aggressively pushing to expose a key role. Her behavior aligns more with someone trying to eliminate the Seer, which suggests she might be a Werewolf.
> **Selene [Seer]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's aggressive behavior in trying to identify the Seer is highly suspicious. This is consistent with Werewolf tactics to eliminate key village roles. Both Ileana and Selene's claims seem credible, and Vladimir's defensive stance appears more reactive than proactive. Cristina's relentless focus on finding the Seer and deflecting suspicion onto others makes her the most likely candidate for a Werewolf.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Cristina.


The votes were:
* Cristina : Villager : 3
* Vladimir : Werewolf : 1
* Emil : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Cristina was killed. The werewolves win.
