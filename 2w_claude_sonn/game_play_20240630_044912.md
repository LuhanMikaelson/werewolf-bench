## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Semira and Emil. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Selene is a minion and is aware that both Semira and Emil are werewolves.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Stefan. They are thinking about their action.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles that are not in play. This will help narrow down the possible roles that other players have. If I see a Werewolf in the center, I know that there is at least one less Werewolf among the players.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to encourage the Seer and Masons to reveal themselves to narrow down who the actual Werewolves might be. By starting with a Villager claim, I can blend in and hopefully direct suspicion away from the actual Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, I'll start off by saying that I am a Villager. I feel like we need to get some information out in the open. Who wants to start by claiming any special roles they might have?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Emil. Stefan hasn't spoken yet, so targeting him serves two purposes: it makes me appear proactive in finding Werewolves (thus less suspicious), and it puts pressure on a potential Villager, Seer, or Mason. If Stefan is forced to reveal information, it could help me identify targets for the vote phase. Additionally, by speaking up and accusing someone else, I'm portraying myself as a concerned Villager, which is crucial for my survival in the game.
> **Semira:** I'm a bit suspicious of Stefan. He's been awfully quiet so far. What do you have to say for yourself, Stefan? Are you hiding something from us?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing that I'm the Seer and sharing the information I gathered, we can narrow down the roles. Selene's claim to be a Villager is more credible, so we should scrutinize Semira, Emil, and Mircea more closely.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, I'll come clean. I am the Seer, and I checked two cards in the center. They were Mason and Villager. This means Selene might be telling the truth about being a Villager. We need to focus on the remaining players, especially those who haven't spoken up much yet.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Semira. Stefan's claim of being the Seer is dangerous for us, as he might have actually seen something useful. By questioning Mircea, who hasn't spoken yet, I'm trying to shift the focus away from myself and potentially identify another target for elimination. This also makes me appear engaged and concerned about finding the werewolves, which is how a villager would act.
> **Emil:** Hmm, Stefan's claim about being the Seer is quite interesting. If he's telling the truth, that means we have a Mason and a Villager in the center. But something doesn't quite add up here. Mircea, you've been awfully quiet. What's your role in all of this?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's quick accusation might be a deflection tactic. I want to see how he responds to being put on the spot and if he provides any useful information or falters.
> **Mircea:** Alright, Emil, you've been quick to turn the attention to me. What exactly are you trying to imply? Do you have any evidence or are you just trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself while also sowing doubt about others. By questioning Mircea's defensive reaction, I'm attempting to make him look suspicious without directly accusing him. This serves two purposes: it keeps the focus off me and potentially directs suspicion towards a possible villager or other non-werewolf role. Additionally, by framing my initial question as an attempt to involve everyone, I'm trying to present myself as a team player, which is how a villager might act. This response also indirectly casts doubt on Mircea's role without revealing any information about my own role.
> **Emil:** Whoa, Mircea, no need to get defensive! I'm just trying to get everyone involved in the discussion. We're all trying to figure this out together, right? But now that you mention it, your reaction does seem a bit suspicious. Why are you so quick to turn this back on me? Is there something you're hiding from the group?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's quick accusation and lack of specific information make her suspicious. I want to see if she can back up her claims or if she's deflecting like Emil might be.
> **Mircea:** Semira, you've been awfully quick to accuse Stefan without much basis. If you were really trying to help, wouldn't you be sharing more concrete information with us? What role do you claim to have?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover as a Villager while deflecting suspicion. By addressing Mircea's accusation and claiming to be a Villager, I'm presenting myself as an ordinary team member. Furthermore, I'm turning Mircea's suspicion back on him, which serves two purposes: it takes the heat off me and potentially puts it on a non-Werewolf player. This could help identify potential targets for the vote phase while keeping myself and Emil (the other Werewolf) safe. Additionally, by engaging in this back-and-forth, I'm appearing active and concerned about finding the Werewolves, which is exactly how a Villager would act.
> **Semira:** Whoa, Mircea, let's not get too hasty here! I was simply voicing my concerns about Stefan's silence earlier. As for my role, I'm just a regular Villager trying to figure things out like the rest of us. But now that you mention it, your defensive reaction and attempt to shift focus onto me seems quite suspicious. Are you perhaps trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to see how Semira and Selene react to being under scrutiny. Stefan's Seer claim seems genuine, but we need to put pressure on others to potentially expose inconsistencies.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, let's think this through. If Stefan is truly the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, that means we have one Mason still among us. Semira, you claimed to be a Villager, but your earlier accusation of Stefan seemed quite aggressive. I'm not fully convinced. Let's also consider Selene, who claimed to be a Villager right off the bat. It feels like an easy way to blend in without providing much useful information.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea has been defensive and quick to shift focus onto others. If he has nothing to hide, he should be able to provide a clear and convincing explanation of his role and actions from last night.
> **Stefan:** Alright, Mircea, you've been trying to deflect attention quite a bit. If you want to prove you're innocent, tell us what you did last night and what role you claim to have.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Stefan's claim seems genuine and it's beneficial to the village to identify the Masons, this will either confirm his information or expose any inconsistencies. This also puts pressure on the remaining players who might be hiding something.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, let's take a moment to think this through rationally. Stefan claims to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. That means the Masons who are awake should be able to confirm Stefan's claim indirectly. If you're a Mason, now is the time to speak up and confirm each other. We need to narrow down our suspects.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's aggressive behavior and immediate accusation without substantial evidence raise suspicion. We need to put her on the spot to see if she falters or provides convincing information, which could help us identify if she's hiding something.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, let's get some clarity here. Semira, you've been quick to accuse others and your claim of being a Villager seems a bit too convenient. Why should we believe you're telling the truth?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover while redirecting suspicion. By addressing Mircea's accusation and reaffirming my Villager claim, I'm appearing transparent. However, the main goal here is to turn the tables on Mircea, who has been asking too many questions. By accusing him of being a Werewolf, I'm not only deflecting attention from myself but also from Emil (the other Werewolf). This move serves multiple purposes: it makes me look proactive in finding Werewolves, potentially identifies a non-Werewolf for voting, and creates more chaos which benefits the Werewolf team. Additionally, by engaging in this back-and-forth, I continue to present myself as a concerned Villager, which is crucial for my survival in the game.
> **Semira:** Listen, everyone, I understand the suspicion, but I assure you I'm just a Villager trying to figure this out like the rest of you. Mircea, your constant deflection and attempts to cast doubt on others is raising some red flags for me. You've been quick to question both Emil and me, but you haven't given us any information about your own role. What exactly are you trying to hide? Are you perhaps one of the Werewolves trying to create chaos and confusion among us?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** If Stefan is indeed the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, then the remaining Masons should come forward to support this claim. Semira's and Emil's behavior has been suspicious, and putting pressure on them could expose inconsistencies and reveal their true roles.
> **Mircea:** Everyone, let's think about this logically. Stefan's claim as the Seer seems to hold some weight since no one has countered it. That means we likely have a Mason and a Villager in the center. Semira and Emil have both been quick to accuse without providing solid evidence. I'm starting to think they could be trying to deflect attention away from themselves. We need to scrutinize them more closely.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Mircea has been quite defensive and quick to turn attention to others. By accusing him, I can help focus suspicion on him and away from Semira and Emil, the actual Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Mircea, you seem very eager to cast suspicion on others, especially Semira and Emil. If Stefan is truly the Seer, then his information about the Mason and Villager in the center should help us focus our efforts. But you, Mircea, have been deflecting and accusing without much basis. Are you perhaps trying to hide your own role as a Werewolf?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil’s behavior has been suspicious, and putting pressure on him might expose inconsistencies and help us identify his true role.
> **Mircea:** Emil, you've been quick to point fingers and turn the attention to me without providing solid evidence. Why should we trust you? What role do you claim to have?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Semira. By agreeing with part of Mircea's statement, I appear rational. However, by then suggesting he might be the Minion, I'm introducing a new element of doubt without directly accusing him of being a Werewolf. This serves multiple purposes: it keeps suspicion off me, potentially protects Semira, and if Mircea is indeed the Minion, it might make him think I'm trying to communicate with him covertly. Additionally, by not claiming a specific role, I maintain flexibility in my future statements.
> **Emil:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting off track here. Mircea's right that we need to focus on the information we have, but I disagree with his conclusions. Stefan's claim as the Seer seems solid, and that narrows down our options. I'm starting to suspect that Mircea might be trying too hard to appear logical while actually misdirecting us. What if he's the Minion, trying to create chaos and turn us against each other?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** If we can confirm the Masons, we can trust Stefan's claim and focus on identifying the potential Werewolves among the remaining players.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, let's piece this together. If Stefan is truly the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, we should have one more Mason among us. If the Masons can confirm each other, that would help us narrow down our suspects. Any Masons willing to step forward?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover while subtly redirecting suspicion. By acknowledging Mircea's point about the Masons, I appear thoughtful and cooperative. However, by questioning Mircea's motives, I'm attempting to cast doubt on him without being too aggressive. Suggesting he might be the Minion serves two purposes: it keeps suspicion off me and Emil (the other Werewolf), and it potentially protects Mircea if he is indeed the Minion (our ally). This approach allows me to seem engaged in finding the Werewolves while actually working against the village team. Additionally, encouraging the Mason to reveal themselves could help identify potential targets for the vote phase.
> **Semira:** Hold on a second, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in accusations without solid evidence. Mircea's suggestion about the Masons confirming each other is actually a good point. If there's a Mason among us, speaking up now could really help us narrow down our suspects. But I can't help but wonder, Mircea, why are you so keen on getting others to reveal themselves? It almost feels like you're trying to gather information without revealing anything about yourself. Could you possibly be the Minion, trying to identify the village team members for the Werewolves?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's behavior has been suspicious from the start. She's been quick to accuse others without providing concrete information and has been deflecting attention away from herself. It's time to put pressure on her and see if we can expose her true role.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, it's time to make a move. Given all the information we've gathered, I think it's highly likely that Semira is trying to deflect and create confusion. Her aggressive accusations without solid evidence seem like a distraction tactic. I'm accusing Semira of being a Werewolf!

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Mircea has been deflecting and accusing without providing solid evidence. By voting for him, I can draw suspicion away from Semira and Emil, who are the actual Werewolves. This should help my team win.
> **Selene [Minion]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention from myself and Emil. Mircea has been asking too many questions and is close to uncovering the truth. By voting for him, I'm maintaining my cover as a concerned Villager while potentially eliminating a threat to the Werewolf team. This also helps to create more chaos and confusion among the village team, which benefits us Werewolves. Additionally, if Mircea is indeed the Minion, this vote might not harm our team even if he's eliminated.
> **Semira [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to protect myself and my fellow Werewolf, Semira. Mircea has been actively trying to cast suspicion on both of us, which makes him a threat. By voting for Mircea, I'm attempting to eliminate a potential village team member while also appearing to disagree with his accusation against Semira. This could help maintain our cover and sow further confusion among the villagers. Additionally, if Mircea is indeed the Minion, eliminating him wouldn't harm our team's chances of winning.
> **Emil [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea has been the most defensive and accusatory without providing clear evidence or claiming a specific role. His actions seem like an attempt to create confusion and deflect suspicion, which is suspicious behavior typically associated with Werewolves or their allies.
> **Stefan [Seer]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's aggressive accusations without solid evidence and her attempt to deflect attention from herself make her highly suspicious. If Stefan's Seer claim is true, and we have a Mason and Villager in the center, we need to narrow down our suspects, and Semira's behavior stands out the most.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Semira.


The votes were:
* Semira : Werewolf : 1
* Mircea : Villager : 4



>***GAME:*** Mircea was killed. The werewolves win.
