## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Semira and Stefan. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.

There is one seer in play, Michael. They are thinking about their action.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles that are not in play, which can help me identify false claims and narrow down the possibilities for who might be a Werewolf or Minion.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** If the Seer comes forward, we might get valuable information about who is or isn't a Werewolf. This can help us start forming our suspicions and guide our questioning.
> **Kraven:** Alright, how about we start by hearing from anyone who might be the Seer? Did anyone see anything useful during the night?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to see if Michael offers any useful information or stumbles over his response. As a Mason, it's crucial to identify potential Werewolves quickly, and pressing for details might help reveal inconsistencies.
> **Emil:** I'm a bit suspicious of Michael. Something feels off. Michael, do you have anything to share about your role?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing my role as the Seer and sharing the information about the center cards helps to clarify the potential roles in play. This information can help identify false claims and narrow down who might be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Michael:** I think it's important to establish some roles early on so we can narrow down our suspects. I am the Seer, and I saw two center cards last night: one Villager and one Mason. This means there are fewer possible roles in play that can be a Werewolf.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Michael's claim to be the Seer without being too aggressive. By questioning his convenient information and then immediately shifting focus to Kraven, I'm trying to deflect suspicion from myself. This also helps me gather more information about other players' potential roles without revealing anything about my own.
> **Semira:** I'm not entirely convinced by Michael's claim to be the Seer. It seems a bit too convenient that he's already trying to narrow down our options. Plus, if there's a Villager and a Mason in the center, that leaves more room for potential Werewolves among us. Kraven, you asked about the Seer earlier - do you have any insights or are you just fishing for information?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** If Michael is lying about being the Seer, his reasoning for checking the center cards might be inconsistent or weak, which could indicate that he's actually a Werewolf or the Minion trying to divert our attention.
> **Kraven:** Michael, your claim about being the Seer and seeing two center cards is interesting, but it doesn't really help us identify any Werewolves among us. Can you explain why you chose to look at the center cards instead of checking a player's card?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira's immediate suspicion of my claim as the Seer without offering any alternative information is suspicious. By questioning her directly, I can potentially reveal more about her role or catch her in a lie if she is a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Michael:** Semira, I'm curious why you're so quick to doubt my claim as the Seer. Do you have any information that contradicts what I've said?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting the conversation to Emil and his earlier suspicion of Michael, I'm attempting to shift focus away from myself while also potentially gathering more information that could be useful for the Werewolf team. This also helps to cast more doubt on Michael's claim without me being the only one questioning him, which could make me look suspicious. Additionally, by mentioning my supposed experience with the game, I'm trying to establish credibility as a thoughtful player, which could help me blend in as a villager.
> **Semira:** Michael, I'm not trying to doubt you unnecessarily, but as someone who's played this game many times, I've learned to be cautious of early claims. I don't have contradicting information, but I do find it odd that you chose to look at center cards instead of a player's card. That seems like a less strategic move for a Seer. Emil, you mentioned being suspicious of Michael earlier. What made you feel that way?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** It's important to scrutinize Michael's actions as the Seer. His decision to look at the center cards instead of a player's card could either be a strategic move or a cover-up. By pressing him on this, we can gauge his response and see if there are any inconsistencies.
> **Emil:** Michael, your claim to be the Seer and seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center is interesting, but as a Mason myself, I know one of the Mason cards is in the center. This backs up part of your claim. However, I'm still not fully convinced. Why did you choose to look at the center cards instead of checking a player's card?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil's hesitation to fully support my claim as the Seer, despite verifying part of my information, is suspicious. If he were truly a Mason, he should be more eager to corroborate my story to help identify the Werewolves.
> **Michael:** Emil, you claim to be a Mason and back up part of my information. However, if you truly are a Mason, you would know the importance of verifying roles quickly. Why aren't you more supportive of my claim, knowing it helps the village confirm roles?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** By pressing Michael on his decision to look at the center cards instead of a player's card, we can gauge his response and see if there are any inconsistencies. If Michael is truly a Seer, he should be able to provide a logical reason for his choice, which can help us confirm his role.
> **Emil:** Michael, your claim to be the Seer and seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center is interesting, but as a Mason myself, I know one of the Mason cards is in the center. This backs up part of your claim. However, I'm still not fully convinced. Why did you choose to look at the center cards instead of checking a player's card?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven initiated the conversation about the Seer but hasn't provided any personal information. Hearing from him could help us gather more information and possibly identify any inconsistencies.
> **Michael:** Kraven, you've been quiet for a bit. Do you have any information or a role you'd like to share with the group?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's choice to look at the center cards is less strategic for a Seer and could be a tactic to avoid confirming or denying anyone's role, which is something a Werewolf or Minion might do.
> **Kraven:** Michael, your claim to be the Seer is suspicious to me. If you were really the Seer, looking at someone's card would give us more actionable information. Why did you choose to look at the center cards instead?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil's hesitation to fully support my Seer claim, despite verifying part of my information, is suspicious. If he were truly a Mason, he should be more eager to corroborate my story to help identify the Werewolves. I want to push Emil to give more information and see if he slips up.
> **Michael:** Emil, you claim to be a Mason, and you verify part of what I've said about the center cards. However, you seem hesitant to fully support my story, which makes me suspicious. If you are truly a Mason, you should be more eager to help confirm roles and catch the Werewolves. Can you explain why you're holding back?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** By pressing Semira for more information, we can determine if she's genuinely cautious or if she's trying to deflect attention from herself. Since she's been skeptical of Michael, it's important to see if she has any information that contradicts his claim or if she could be a Werewolf herself.
> **Emil:** Semira, your cautious approach makes sense, but I'm curious about your role. You've been quick to question Michael's claim, which is reasonable. However, what information do you have that could help us identify the Werewolves? Are you hiding something?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue sowing doubt about Michael's Seer claim while also casting suspicion on Emil. By pointing out the inconsistencies in their stories and their lack of mutual support, I'm trying to make them both look suspicious without directly accusing either one. This could lead to the group potentially voting for one of them instead of me or Stefan. Additionally, by presenting myself as analytical and observant, I'm attempting to appear as a helpful Villager, further deflecting suspicion from myself.
> **Semira:** I find it interesting that both Emil and Michael are claiming roles that could potentially verify each other, yet there's still tension between them. Emil, if you're truly a Mason, wouldn't you be more inclined to support Michael's claim about the center cards? And Michael, if you're really the Seer, why not look at a player's card to give us more concrete information? I'm starting to wonder if one or both of you might be trying to deceive us.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Semira. By targeting Emil, who claims to be a Mason, I'm attempting to sow discord among the village team. This could potentially lead to the elimination of a village-aligned player. Additionally, by seeming to partially support Michael's claim, I appear more trustworthy while still maintaining an air of skepticism that keeps the group from fully trusting anyone
> **Stefan:** I'm becoming increasingly suspicious of Emil. He claims to be a Mason, which would partially corroborate Michael's story about the center cards, but he's been oddly hesitant to fully support Michael. That's not typical Mason behavior. Emil, if you're really a Mason, why aren't you more enthusiastic about confirming roles? It almost seems like you're trying to cast doubt on Michael while appearing cooperative.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know the importance of quickly identifying potential Werewolves. Michael's decision to look at the center cards instead of a player's card seems strategically weak and could indicate he's trying to mislead us. By pressing him harder, we can see if there's any inconsistency in his story.
> **Emil:** Stefan, I'm going to address your suspicion. Yes, I am a Mason, and I know that one of the Mason cards is in the center. This partially corroborates Michael's claim. However, I find it suspicious that Michael chose to look at the center cards instead of a player's card as a Seer. It feels like he's trying to avoid giving concrete information about any of us. I think Michael might be trying to deceive us.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil's hesitation to fully back up my Seer claim, despite verifying part of my information, raises suspicion. If he were really a Mason, he would be more supportive. This line of questioning could expose inconsistencies or force Emil to reveal more about his role.
> **Michael:** Emil, I'm finding your behavior quite suspicious. You claim to be a Mason and partially back up my information, yet you're hesitant to fully support my claim. If you were truly a Mason, you'd be more eager to confirm roles and catch the Werewolves. Why aren't you acting like a Mason should?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven has been very quiet and only asked about the Seer, which could be a tactic to gather information without revealing anything about himself. It's time to press him and see if he slips or provides useful information.
> **Emil:** Kraven, I think it's time you shared your role. You've been fishing for information but staying very quiet about yourself. Are you hiding something?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's claim of being a Mason should mean he supports the Seer's information more strongly. His hesitation makes me suspect he might be lying or trying to deceive us.
> **Kraven:** Emil, I need you to clarify something. You say you're a Mason and that one of the Mason cards is in the center, which partially backs up Michael's claim. However, if you truly are a Mason, why are you so hesitant to fully support Michael's story? Shouldn't you be more eager to catch the Werewolves?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's claim to be the Seer is suspicious because he chose to look at the center cards instead of a player's card. This move is less strategic for a genuine Seer and could be a tactic to avoid confirming or denying anyone's role. Additionally, Emil's claim as a Mason only partially corroborates Michael's story, and Emil's hesitation to fully support Michael adds to the suspicion. Overall, Michael's actions and reasoning do not align with a true Seer's behavior.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** I am confident that I am a Mason, which means one of the Mason cards is in the center as Michael claimed. However, Michael's decision to look at the center cards as the Seer instead of a player's card seems strategically weak and could be a cover-up. This makes me suspicious that he might be a Werewolf trying to avoid giving concrete information about any of us. Given that his actions don't align with the Seer's typical behavior, I believe Michael is attempting to deceive us and could very well be a Werewolf.
> **Emil [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention from myself and Stefan. Emil's claim to be a Mason while still being hesitant about Michael's Seer claim makes him an easy target. By voting for Emil, I'm reinforcing the suspicion others have expressed about him, potentially saving myself and my fellow Werewolf from elimination. This also helps maintain my facade as a cautious villager trying to make the right decision.
> **Semira [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate village-aligned players. Emil's claim to be a Mason, while not fully supporting Michael's story, makes him a prime target. By voting for Emil, I can potentially eliminate a village team member while appearing to act in the village's interest. This move also helps protect my fellow Werewolf, Semira, by keeping suspicion away from us.
> **Stefan [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil's claim to be a Mason is suspicious because he is hesitant to fully support my Seer claim, despite verifying part of my information. A true Mason would be more eager to corroborate roles and catch Werewolves. His behavior suggests he's trying to cast doubt while appearing cooperative, which is not typical Mason behavior.
> **Michael [Seer]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Emil : Mason : 3
* Michael : Seer : 2



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The werewolves win.
