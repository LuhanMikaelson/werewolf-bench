## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Michael and Alexandra. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Marius is a minion and is aware that both Michael and Alexandra are werewolves.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dracula. They are thinking about their action.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gain information about which roles are not in play and potentially deduce the roles of other players. This is especially useful in the early stages of the game to guide our discussions during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By sharing what I saw in the center, we can narrow down the roles in play and potentially catch inconsistencies in others' claims. It's important to gather as much information as possible to identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Alright, let's get this started. I looked at two of the center cards last night, and I saw that they were Mason and Villager. This means that we have one less Mason and one less Villager in play. Given this information, I'm curious to hear what roles everyone else is claiming.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Dracula's claim without being too aggressive. By questioning his information and appealing to the group, I'm trying to appear as a cautious Villager. This also helps to shift focus away from myself and potentially my Werewolf partner, Alexandra. Additionally, by encouraging others to share their thoughts, I'm hoping to gather more information about the other players' roles without revealing my own.
> **Michael:** That's interesting information, Dracula. But how can we be sure you're telling the truth? I mean, claiming to be the Seer is a pretty convenient way to avoid suspicion. I'm not saying you're lying, but we should be cautious. What do the rest of you think about this?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Michael. By appearing to defend Dracula and believe his claim, I'm positioning myself as a trusting villager. At the same time, I'm subtly casting doubt on Michael's skepticism to create distance between us. By directly questioning Andrei, I'm putting pressure on another player and potentially identifying a target for later. This also helps me gather more information about the other players' roles without revealing anything about my own.
> **Alexandra:** Hold on a second, Michael. I think you're being a bit too quick to cast doubt on Dracula. If he's telling the truth about being the Seer, that's incredibly valuable information for us villagers. And if he's lying, well, that's a pretty risky move this early in the game. I'm more inclined to believe him at this point. What about you, Andrei? You've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim about seeing the center cards needs to be verified. If Marius claims to be a Mason, it would support Dracula's statement. If not, we need to scrutinize Dracula's claim further.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, I'm curious, if you really are the Seer and you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, that means we should have one Mason left in play. Marius, what role did you wake up as?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to divert suspicion away from Michael and Alexandra, the actual Werewolves, and cast doubt on someone else. By accusing Andrei, I can stir up confusion and keep the attention off my werewolf teammates.
> **Marius:** Alright folks, here's my take. Given that Dracula claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, that means we have one Mason and one Villager in play. Now, Andrei is being awfully quiet, which makes me suspicious. If I had to guess, I'd say Andrei might be one of the Werewolves trying to blend in. What do you all think? Andrei, what do you have to say to that?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael’s immediate skepticism could be an attempt to deflect attention. If Michael is hiding something, we need to uncover it. Plus, knowing Michael's role can help us piece together the truth.
> **Andrei:** Alright, let's think this through. Michael, you've cast doubt on Dracula's claim about being the Seer. If you’re so skeptical, what role did you wake up as?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself while also sowing doubt about others. By claiming to be a Villager, I'm taking on a neutral role that's hard to disprove. I'm also subtly casting doubt on Dracula's claim by emphasizing 'if he's telling the truth,' which could help protect Alexandra, the other Werewolf. By questioning Marius about his quick accusation of Andrei, I'm trying to shift focus away from myself and potentially create conflict between other players. This could help mask my true identity and create more confusion among the Villagers.
> **Michael:** Whoa, hold on there, Andrei! I understand you're trying to get information, but throwing accusations around isn't helping anyone. To answer your question, I woke up as a Villager. Nothing special, I'm afraid. But let's focus on something more important - Dracula's claim about the center cards. If he's telling the truth, that means we have one Mason and two Werewolves among us. That's pretty scary! I think we need to hear from everyone. Marius, you seemed pretty quick to accuse Andrei. What's your role in all this?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** I'm trying to get more information from Andrei to see if we can catch any inconsistencies in his statements. By focusing on him, it will also help in diverting attention away from Michael and Alexandra.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's take a moment and think this through. Dracula claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, which means we might still have one Mason and one Villager among us. Given this, and considering that Michael has claimed to be a Villager, I'm curious about Andrei's role. Andrei, if you're not one of the Werewolves, what role did you wake up as?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been deflecting and accusing without revealing his own role. If he's not the Mason, it could cast doubt on Dracula's claim or might indicate he's one of the Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Andrei:** Alright, here's what I'm thinking. Dracula claims to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. That leaves us with a Mason and two Villagers in play if we assume he's telling the truth. Michael has claimed to be a Villager, which seems plausible, but we still have no confirmation about the remaining Mason. Marius has been quick to accuse me, and Alexandra has been supporting Dracula's claim. Marius, you've been skirting the question about your role. If you woke up as a Mason, say it now. Otherwise, I'm starting to think you might be hiding something.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei's hesitance to clearly state his role is suspicious. By pressing him further, we can gauge his reaction and potentially catch him in a lie, thus shifting the focus away from Michael and Alexandra.
> **Marius:** Alright Andrei, you're deflecting quite a bit and avoiding answering directly. If you truly believe that Dracula is the Seer and Michael is a Villager, what role did you wake up as? And if you're not a Werewolf, you should have no problem being clear about it.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, my role is to identify the Werewolves. Dracula's claim about the center cards hasn't been directly contradicted yet, and Michael claiming to be a Villager aligns with the information we have. Marius, on the other hand, has been deflecting and accusing without offering any solid information about his own role. This makes me suspicious of him.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, I'm a Villager, and I believe that we need to focus on Marius. He's been quick to accuse others without revealing his own role. Why is that, Marius?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Alexandra on the spot, it will force her to provide a role claim and potentially create discrepancies, which can be used to divert suspicion away from Michael and me. Additionally, it helps in identifying the roles of other players more clearly.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's get to the bottom of this. Alexandra, you've been rather supportive of Dracula's claim about being the Seer. However, we've yet to hear any concrete details from you. What role did you wake up as?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue maintaining my cover as a Villager. By claiming to be a Villager, I'm aligning myself with the majority and appearing to be on the village team. I'm also turning the tables on Marius, who's been asking a lot of questions. This serves two purposes: it takes the heat off me and potentially Michael (the other Werewolf), and it casts suspicion on Marius. If Marius is indeed a villager or a Mason, getting him voted out would be beneficial for the Werewolf team. Additionally, by supporting Dracula's claim, I continue to build trust with the group while secretly knowing that his information doesn't actually harm the Werewolves' position.
> **Alexandra:** Well, Marius, since you're so keen on getting answers from everyone, I'll gladly share. I woke up as a Villager. Now, I've been supportive of Dracula's claim because it makes sense and gives us valuable information. But I'm starting to wonder why you're so focused on getting everyone else to reveal their roles while being evasive about your own. Are you perhaps trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Andrei and highlighting potential inconsistencies in his statements, I can divert attention away from Michael and Alexandra, the actual Werewolves. This also creates a logical narrative that fits with the information provided so far, making my accusation more believable.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and look at the big picture here. Dracula has claimed to be the Seer and has provided some useful information about the center cards. Michael and Alexandra have both claimed to be Villagers, and Andrei has also claimed to be a Villager. That's a lot of Villagers! But something isn't quite adding up. We know there should only be three Villagers according to the roles we have in play. Dracula claims to have seen one Villager in the center, which leaves us with just two Villagers among us. So, either Dracula is lying about being the Seer, or one of these 'Villagers' is not telling the truth. Given that Michael and Alexandra have been more active in the discussion, I'm starting to think Andrei might be the one who's being deceitful. Andrei, if you're a Villager, you should be helping us out more, but you've been quite defensive and vague. I'm really starting to think you might be one of the Werewolves! What does everyone else think?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Dracula, I can cast doubt on his Seer claim, which may cause confusion among the Villagers. This helps protect Michael and Alexandra, the actual Werewolves, and keeps the focus away from them.
> **Marius:** Dracula, I understand that you claim to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center. But, what if you're lying and just trying to divert attention away from yourself? Can you explain why we should believe your claim?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius has been evasive about his role and quick to cast doubt on others without providing his own details. It's important to get a clear answer from him to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Dracula:** Marius, you're deflecting quite a bit and avoiding answering directly. If you truly believe that I'm the Seer and Michael is a Villager, what role did you wake up as? And if you're not a Werewolf, you should have no problem being clear about it.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting suspicion on Andrei, I divert attention away from Michael and Alexandra, the actual Werewolves. This also fits with the narrative that we've been discussing and makes my accusation more believable, keeping the heat off my allies.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, it's clear that we've got a lot of claims flying around. Dracula insists he's the Seer and saw a Mason and Villager in the center, Michael and Alexandra both claim to be Villagers, and Andrei also claims to be a Villager. But here's the thing, we've only got three Villagers in play according to the roles we know. Dracula saw one in the center, which should leave us with only two Villagers among us. This means one of these three Villager claims must be false. Andrei has been awfully defensive and vague, which makes me think he's hiding something. If I had to take a guess, I'd say Andrei is the Werewolf. What do you all think?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius has been quick to cast doubt on others without revealing his own role. We need to get a clear answer from him to determine if he's hiding something. His behavior is highly suspicious and needs clarification immediately.
> **Dracula:** Marius, your evasiveness and constant deflection are not helping the village at all. If you have nothing to hide, you should be straightforward with your role. So, what role did you wake up as?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting suspicion on Andrei, I divert attention away from Michael and Alexandra, the actual Werewolves. This also fits with the narrative that we've been discussing and makes my accusation more believable, keeping the heat off my allies.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, I've had some time to think about this, and I believe the biggest mystery here is Andrei. Something just doesn't add up with his defensive and vague responses. We've got Dracula claiming to be the Seer, Michael and Alexandra both claiming to be Villagers, and Andrei also claims to be a Villager. But we know there should only be three Villagers in the game, including the one Dracula saw in the center. So, with three claiming to be Villagers, one of these claims has to be false. Andrei, your reluctance to provide clear answers makes me think you're the Werewolf. We need to focus on him.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Alexandra. Marius has been very vocal in accusing others, particularly Andrei, which makes him a good target to redirect suspicion towards. By questioning Marius directly, I'm attempting to put him on the defensive and make him look suspicious. This could potentially create doubt about his intentions and take the focus off of the actual Werewolves. Additionally, by appearing to seek information and clarity, I'm trying to present myself as a concerned Villager, further hiding my true identity.
> **Michael:** Hey everyone, I think we're getting a bit off track here. Marius keeps pushing suspicion onto Andrei, but I can't help but notice how Marius has been dodging questions about his own role. Marius, you've been awfully quick to accuse others, but you haven't given us any information about yourself. What exactly is your role in all of this?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius has been evasive and deflective throughout the discussion. He has not given a clear answer about his role, which raises suspicion. Given the information I provided about the Mason and Villager being in the center, we should have one Mason and one Villager among us, and Marius's behavior suggests he might be hiding something. Therefore, I believe voting for Marius is the best course of action to help the village team win.
> **Dracula [Seer]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate potential threats. Marius has been very vocal and accusatory, which could lead to uncovering the truth. By voting for him, I'm attempting to eliminate a player who's been actively trying to solve the mystery. Additionally, this vote aligns with my previous questioning of Marius, making it seem like I'm a concerned Villager following through on my suspicions. This move also helps protect Alexandra, the other Werewolf, by shifting focus away from her.
> **Michael [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Michael. Marius has been consistently evasive about his own role while pushing suspicion onto others, particularly Andrei. By voting for Marius, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm aligning myself with Michael's last statement, which helps maintain our secret alliance, 2) I'm appearing to act in the village's interest by targeting someone who's been suspicious, and 3) I'm potentially eliminating a villager or Mason, which benefits the Werewolf team. This vote also helps maintain my cover as a supposed Villager, as it seems like a logical choice given the information available to the group.
> **Alexandra [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been deflecting and accusing others without revealing his own role. This behavior is suspicious and inconsistent with someone who is genuinely trying to help the village. Dracula's claim about the center cards has not been directly contradicted, and Michael and Alexandra's claims of being Villagers align with that information. Marius's evasiveness makes me believe he could be hiding a Werewolf or Minion role.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei has been defensive and vague in his responses, which makes me highly suspicious of him. Given the information that Dracula saw a Mason and Villager in the center and the number of Villager claims, one of these claims must be false. Andrei's behavior fits the profile of someone trying to hide their true role. Voting for him is the best way to protect Michael and Alexandra, the Werewolves, and create confusion among the Villagers.
> **Marius [Minion]:** I am voting for Andrei.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Villager : 1
* Marius : Minion : 4



>***GAME:*** Marius was killed. The werewolves win.
