## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Mircea. By targeting Alexandra, who hasn't been mentioned yet, I'm creating a diversion. Asking about what she saw last night puts her on the spot and might reveal if she's the Seer or a Mason, which would be valuable information for us Werewolves. If she's a Villager, her response might still sow confusion among the group. This approach allows me to appear engaged and suspicious of others without revealing any information about my own role.
> **Viktor:** I don't know about you all, but I'm getting a weird vibe from Alexandra. She's been awfully quiet, hasn't she? What do you think you saw last night, Alexandra? Care to share with the group?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's quick accusation seems suspicious. It's a common tactic for Werewolves or the Minion to try to deflect attention from themselves. By putting him on the spot, I might catch him off guard or make him reveal something useful.
> **Alexandra:** Alright Viktor, let's turn the tables. You seem pretty eager to throw suspicion my way. What did you see last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover as a villager while also keeping the pressure on Alexandra. By reiterating my question and claiming to be a villager, I'm attempting to appear innocent and concerned about the village's safety. This approach serves multiple purposes: it deflects suspicion from me, keeps Alexandra on the defensive, and might reveal information about her role if she feels pressured to respond. Additionally, by engaging in this back-and-forth, I'm creating a distraction that might prevent other players from focusing on Mircea or myself.
> **Viktor:** Hold on a second, Alexandra. I asked you first, and you're deflecting. That's pretty suspicious behavior. But since you're so interested, I'll tell you what I saw: nothing unusual. I'm just a regular villager trying to figure out who the werewolves are, like most of us here. Now, can you please answer my original question? What did you see last night that's making you so defensive?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's quick accusation and defensive behavior are classic signs of someone trying to deflect suspicion away from themselves. By pressing him, I might be able to catch him off guard and get more information about his true role.
> **Alexandra:** Alright Viktor, you're being awfully defensive for someone who claims they saw nothing unusual. Could it be that you're trying to hide something?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue deflecting suspicion away from myself while also maintaining pressure on Alexandra. By involving Dragos in the conversation, I'm attempting to create a coalition against Alexandra, which could potentially lead to her being voted out. This serves multiple purposes: it keeps the focus off me, potentially eliminates a village-aligned player, and might reveal more information about Dragos's role based on his response. Additionally, by appearing to seek others' opinions, I'm trying to present myself as a concerned villager working for the group's benefit, further cementing my cover.
> **Viktor:** Look, I understand the suspicion, Alexandra, but I'm not hiding anything. I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this like everyone else. What's really interesting is how quick you were to turn the tables instead of answering a simple question. That kind of evasion makes me wonder if you might be one of the werewolves trying to throw us off the scent. Dragos, you've been pretty quiet. What do you think about Alexandra's behavior? Does it seem suspicious to you too?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to keep my options open and gather more information. By slowing down the accusation process, I might be able to detect more clues and avoid falsely accusing a fellow villager.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's not get carried away with accusations just yet. We need to gather more information. Viktor and Alexandra’s exchange has been quite heated, but it’s also possible they’re both villagers trying to figure things out. Let's not jump to conclusions.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Viktor, the other Werewolf. By addressing Selene, who hasn't spoken yet, I'm shifting the focus to a new player while appearing to be actively engaged in solving the mystery. This also helps me gather more information about potential villagers or special roles without revealing my true identity. Additionally, by seeming reasonable and cautioning against hasty judgments, I'm portraying myself as a level-headed villager, which could help build trust with the group.
> **Mircea:** I think we need to be careful about jumping to conclusions too quickly. Viktor and Alexandra's back-and-forth seems like it could be two villagers genuinely trying to figure things out. But Selene, you've been awfully quiet. What's your take on all of this? Did you notice anything unusual last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Mircea, Viktor, and Alexandra are already engaged in a heated exchange. By casting suspicion on Viktor, I aim to deflect attention away from Mircea and me as we are on the werewolf team. This can help keep Viktor and Mircea safe while potentially sowing doubt among the villagers.
> **Selene:** Mircea brings up a good point about not jumping to conclusions. But I have to say, Viktor, your eagerness to point fingers right at the start and then your defensiveness when questioned is quite suspicious. If I were to guess, it seems like classic werewolf behavior trying to deflect attention. We should be careful, but Viktor’s behavior just doesn't sit right with me.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been playing it safe and neutral, which could be a tactic to avoid suspicion. By asking him directly, we may force him to reveal more information or slip up if he's hiding something.
> **Alexandra:** Dragos, you've been quite neutral and haven't shared much about what you saw or think. Could you tell us your thoughts on the current situation and any insights from last night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's confidence in accusing Viktor could indicate she has some specific information. By asking her directly, I can gather more details about her role and her observations, which will help us understand her motivations better.
> **Dragos:** Selene, you seem very sure about Viktor's behavior being suspicious. What did you see last night that makes you so certain?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By targeting Dragos, I shift suspicion away from Viktor and Mircea while casting doubt on someone who hasn't drawn much attention. This deflection can help keep my werewolf allies safe and confuse the villagers.
> **Selene:** Dragos, your neutrality is starting to look like you're trying to stay under the radar. That's classic werewolf behavior. What did you see last night that's making you play it so safe?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's confidence in accusing Viktor without clear reason is suspicious. It could indicate that she's trying to mislead us and avoid scrutiny herself. By calling her out, we might get her to reveal more information or expose inconsistencies in her story.
> **Dragos:** I'm starting to think Selene might be a Werewolf. She's been very vocal about accusing Viktor without providing any solid evidence. It feels like she's trying to divert attention away from herself.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By continuing to cast doubt on Dragos, I can deflect attention away from Viktor and Mircea while maintaining my cover as a villager. Dragos's accusation against me can be turned against him, making him look like the desperate one. This helps to keep the focus away from my werewolf allies and adds confusion to the villagers' deliberations.
> **Selene:** Dragos, your attempt to turn the tables and accuse me after I've just pointed out Viktor's suspicious behavior seems like a desperate move. If you're so confident that I'm the werewolf, then why don't you share with us what your role is? You've been playing it safe this whole time, and suddenly you're eager to point fingers. To me, that screams werewolf trying to deflect suspicion.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's confidence in accusing Viktor without providing clear reason is suspicious. If she has specific information, she should share it. Her behavior might indicate she's trying to mislead us, so pressing her for details could expose inconsistencies or reveal more about her role.
> **Dragos:** Selene, you've been quick to accuse Viktor without providing solid evidence. That strikes me as suspicious behavior. You've been very vocal about pointing fingers, which makes me think you're trying to divert attention away from yourself. What exactly did you see last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By directly questioning Dragos and accusing him of suspicious behavior, I can deflect attention away from Viktor and Mircea. This strategy keeps the focus on Dragos and maintains confusion among the villagers, which benefits the werewolf team.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's not lose our heads here. Dragos, you're trying to turn the tables on me without much evidence. I find that very suspicious. Why are you so quick to accuse me? Is it because you're trying to hide something? I've seen villagers act defensively when they're cornered, but your behavior is more than that. It feels like you're trying to deflect the blame. If you're really a villager, then tell us what you saw last night.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra's deflection tactics and lack of concrete information make her behavior quite suspicious. By pressing her for details, we can gather more information and possibly expose inconsistencies in her story, which will help us identify if she's hiding something.
> **Dragos:** Alexandra, I find it interesting that you haven't shared any specifics about what you saw last night. You've been quick to deflect and turn the tables on Viktor, but you haven't provided any real information to help us. What did you actually see last night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's behavior has been consistently defensive and quick to deflect suspicion onto others. This is a common tactic used by werewolves to avoid being detected. By reminding everyone of his initial accusation, I aim to keep the focus on his suspicious behavior.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, Viktor's eagerness to accuse me right off the bat still doesn't sit right with me. It feels like classic werewolf behavior to deflect attention right away. Let's not forget his initial accusation when we started this discussion.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's eagerness to accuse Alexandra and his subsequent defensiveness make him a key point of suspicion. By pressing him for more details about his observations, we might be able to detect inconsistencies in his story or gather useful information to determine his true role.
> **Dragos:** Viktor, you've been defending yourself quite vehemently, but without giving us much to work with. You said you're just a regular villager, but can you share a bit more about what you observed last night? Did you notice anything or anyone acting suspiciously?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to continue deflecting suspicion while also gathering information. By bringing up the absence of a Seer claim, I'm indirectly pressuring any potential Seer to reveal themselves, which would be valuable information for the Werewolf team. Targeting Selene serves multiple purposes: it keeps the focus off me, potentially forces her to reveal her role or lie (which could be used against her later), and might create doubt about her previous accusations. Additionally, by framing this as an attempt to gather concrete evidence, I'm trying to portray myself as a logical, village-aligned player, further cementing my cover.
> **Viktor:** Look, I understand everyone's suspicion, but we're getting nowhere by just pointing fingers at each other. We need to focus on finding concrete evidence. I've been honest about my role as a villager from the start. What's interesting is that no one has claimed to be the Seer yet. Surely, if we had a Seer among us, they would have some valuable information to share by now. Unless... the Seer is trying to hide their identity to protect themselves. Selene, you've been quite vocal about accusing others. Are you perhaps the Seer, and that's why you're so confident in your accusations?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting suspicion on Dragos, I aim to divert attention away from Viktor and Mircea (the actual Werewolves). This keeps my allies safe while making Dragos look more suspicious. The more confusion I can sow among the villagers, the better.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, we've been going back and forth with accusations, but let's try to piece together what we know. Viktor's been really defensive, and he's quick to accuse others. But Dragos, you've been pretty neutral and only started accusing when pointed out. That behavior seems suspicious to me. If I had to guess, I'd say Dragos is trying to stay under the radar as a Werewolf. We need to focus on real evidence and not let anyone slip through the cracks.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate village-aligned players. Selene has been vocal and suspicious of me, which makes her a threat. By voting for her, I'm attempting to remove a potentially dangerous player while also maintaining my cover. Her accusations against me and Dragos make her seem like a villager trying to uncover the werewolves. Eliminating her could weaken the village team. Additionally, this vote aligns with my earlier questioning of her, making it seem like a logical progression of my 'villager' persona rather than a werewolf's strategic move.
> **Viktor [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to protect myself and Viktor while appearing to make a logical choice. Selene has been quite vocal in accusing others, particularly Viktor, which could lead to our team's defeat. By voting for her, I'm deflecting suspicion from myself and Viktor while eliminating a potential threat. Additionally, her accusations against Dragos could make my vote seem reasonable to the other players, as I'm siding with someone who's been accused. This move allows me to blend in with the villagers while still working towards the Werewolf team's victory.
> **Mircea [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's initial quick accusation and subsequent defensive behavior are classic signs of someone trying to deflect suspicion away from themselves. His insistence on being a regular villager without providing useful information further raises doubts about his role. Selene’s and Dragos’s accusations seemed to have more thought behind them, while Viktor's actions seem more like those of someone trying to avoid detection. Therefore, I believe Viktor is the most likely to be a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Throughout the discussion, Dragos has been neutral and only started accusing others when pointed out, which seems like a classic werewolf trying to stay under the radar. By voting for Dragos, I aim to deflect suspicion from Viktor and Mircea, helping our team win.
> **Selene [Minion]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene has been very vocal about accusing Viktor without providing solid evidence. Her behavior seems aimed at diverting attention away from herself, which is classic werewolf behavior. Additionally, no clear information has surfaced from her side, making her the most suspicious player to me.
> **Dragos [Mason]:** I am voting for Selene.


The votes were:
* Viktor : Werewolf : 1
* Selene : Minion : 3
* Dragos : Mason : 1



>***GAME:*** Selene was killed. The werewolves win.
