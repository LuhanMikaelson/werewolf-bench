There is one seer in play, Ileana. They are thinking about their action.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about which roles are not in play. This will help everyone deduce the possible roles of the other players more effectively and make it easier to identify any false claims.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to start gathering information to see if anyone claims a role that is already in the center or if inconsistencies arise.
> **Ileana:** Lucian, what role did you get?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know that Larisa is the other Mason. Revealing this information helps establish trust between us and guides us towards identifying potential Werewolves among the other players.
> **Lucian:** Ileana, I had a role that lets me know for sure that Larisa is trustworthy. Larisa, can you confirm?


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I am a Mason and I saw that Lucian is the other Mason, it makes sense to confirm his statement. This will help build trust among the Villagers and narrow down potential Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Lucian, I can confirm that you're trustworthy. We both know each other's roles.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Since both Larisa and I can confirm each other's roles as Masons, it's essential to get more information from the others to identify potential Werewolves. This will help us narrow down the suspects.
> **Lucian:** Marius, we need some clarity here. What role did you have last night?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Selene. By questioning Lucian and Larisa's alliance, I'm creating doubt about their trustworthiness while also implying that I'm just a regular Villager without any special night actions. This might make the others focus on investigating Lucian and Larisa instead of me or Selene. Additionally, by claiming I didn't have a special role, I'm indirectly suggesting I might be a Villager, which is the safest claim for a Werewolf to make.
> **Marius:** I'm not sure what you mean, Lucian. I didn't have any special role last night. I think you and Larisa might be trying to mislead us. It's suspicious that you two are so quick to vouch for each other. Are you perhaps the Werewolves working together?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Larisa and I can confirm each other's roles as Masons, it's important to gather more information from the remaining players. Ileana initiated the questioning, so it's logical to ask her about her role to see if there are any inconsistencies or if she provides useful information about her identity.
> **Lucian:** Ileana, what role did you have last night?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I am the Seer and I saw two Villager cards in the center, it rules out the possibility of those roles being in play. This will help narrow down any false claims and identify the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** I'm going to say this outright: I saw two Villager cards in the center. That means anyone claiming to be a Villager might be lying.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Ileana revealed specific information about the center cards, it's crucial to hear from Selene. This will help us identify any inconsistencies and narrow down the suspects further.
> **Lucian:** Selene, you haven't said anything yet. What role did you have last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Marius. By supporting Marius's earlier accusation and questioning Lucian and Larisa's alliance, I'm attempting to sow discord among the villagers. This also helps me appear engaged and analytical, which a villager might do. Additionally, by directing the question to Lucian, I'm putting pressure on a potential Seer or Mason, roles that would be beneficial to eliminate.
> **Selene:** Well, this is certainly getting interesting! I've been observing quietly, and I must say, Marius's accusation against Lucian and Larisa seems quite plausible. It's suspicious how quickly they vouched for each other. Lucian, you claim to know Larisa is trustworthy, but how can we be sure you're not just covering for each other as the Werewolves?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to highlight the information we've gathered and the potential inconsistencies to make sure everyone is paying attention to the details. This will help us identify the Werewolves based on their responses and behavior.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's focus on the facts we have so far. Ileana says she saw two Villager cards in the center, which means any claim of being a Villager might be suspect. Marius is deflecting, which seems suspicious, and Selene is siding with Marius without giving us her role.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Marius hasn't given us his role and is deflecting suspicion onto Lucian and me. Given Ileana's information about the Villager cards in the center, Marius's claim becomes even more suspicious. It's important to confront him directly to get clarity.
> **Larisa:** Marius, you claimed that Lucian and I might be working together as Werewolves, but Ileana has already said there are two Villager cards in the center. That means anyone claiming to be a Villager is likely lying. You haven't given us your role yet, so I'm directly accusing you. Are you the Werewolf?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Selene. By addressing Larisa's accusation and then quickly shifting focus to Selene, I'm attempting to create doubt about Selene's innocence while also maintaining my own facade of innocence. This move serves multiple purposes: it responds to the direct accusation against me, potentially makes Larisa look overly aggressive, and puts pressure on Selene. If Selene is clever, she might use this opportunity to claim a role that would be hard to disprove, further muddying the waters for the village team. Additionally, by asking about Selene's role, I'm acting as if I don't know what it is, which is exactly what an innocent villager would do.
> **Marius:** Larisa, I appreciate your direct approach, but I think you're barking up the wrong tree. I'm not a Werewolf, and I find it interesting that you're so quick to accuse me when I simply raised a valid concern about you and Lucian. Let's not forget that Ileana claimed to see two Villager cards in the center, which makes me wonder about Selene. She's been awfully quiet and evasive about her role. Selene, care to share what your role is with the group?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and Marius. By claiming to be the Seer and providing false information about a center card, I'm establishing credibility while also sowing doubt about Lucian and Larisa's alliance. This move also indirectly supports Ileana's claim, making her less likely to suspect me. By directing the question to Lucian, I'm putting pressure on a potential threat to the Werewolf team, hoping to expose any inconsistencies in their story.
> **Selene:** Hold on a minute, Marius. I understand your suspicion, but I think you're jumping to conclusions too quickly. I've been observing and analyzing everyone's behavior, which is why I haven't been as vocal. To answer your question, I'm actually the Seer. I looked at one of the center cards last night and saw a Mason card. This information, combined with Ileana's claim about the two Villager cards, gives us a clearer picture. Lucian and Larisa, your quick alliance is still concerning. Can you explain exactly how you know each other's roles?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's late reveal of seeing a Mason card in the center raises suspicion about her true role. If she was truly the Seer, she should have shared this information earlier. This inconsistency needs to be addressed to determine if she's lying or not.
> **Lucian:** Selene, if you are indeed the Seer, then why did you not mention seeing a Mason card in the center earlier? It seems like convenient timing now that you're under suspicion. Can you explain why you chose to reveal this information so late?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By defending my 'Seer' claim and providing a plausible explanation for my delayed revelation, I'm attempting to maintain my credibility. At the same time, I'm redirecting suspicion back to Lucian and Larisa, who pose the biggest threat to the Werewolf team. By suggesting they might be Werewolves posing as Masons, I'm sowing doubt about their alliance while also appearing to contribute valuable deductions to the group. This strategy aims to keep me in the game while potentially getting a Villager, Mason, or Seer eliminated.
> **Selene:** I understand your skepticism, Lucian, but there's a simple explanation. As the Seer, I initially held back my information to observe everyone's reactions and gather more data. It's a common strategy to avoid immediate targeting by the Werewolves. Now that we're deeper into the discussion, I felt it was crucial to share this information to help us piece together the puzzle. The Mason card I saw in the center, combined with Ileana's claim about two Villager cards, leaves us with only one unknown center card. This actually makes your and Larisa's claim about knowing each other's roles even more suspicious. Are you two perhaps the Werewolves trying to pose as Masons?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's claim directly contradicts what Larisa and I know to be true. We've been upfront about being Masons from the start. Selene's timing and information seem suspicious and inconsistent.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, let's piece this together. Ileana claimed to see two Villager cards in the center, and Selene is now saying she saw a Mason card in the center. If that's true, it means Larisa or I can't be Masons. This raises a big red flag for me about Selene's sudden Seer claim.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Selene. By questioning Selene's claim, I'm actually trying to make it seem like I'm a concerned villager, which could lend credibility to my innocence. This move serves multiple purposes: it keeps the discussion focused on Selene, potentially making her look suspicious, which she can then use to her advantage to create more chaos. It also indirectly supports her claim by engaging with it seriously, which might make others less likely to outright dismiss it. Additionally, by asking for others' opinions, I'm acting as if I'm genuinely trying to solve the puzzle, which is exactly what an innocent villager would do. This strategy aims to keep the villagers confused and divided, giving us Werewolves a better chance of surviving the vote.
> **Marius:** I think we're getting sidetracked here. Selene's sudden Seer claim is extremely suspicious. If she really was the Seer, why wait until now to reveal such crucial information? It seems like she's trying to create confusion and doubt. I believe we should focus our attention on Selene. What do you all think about her claim?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting the focus back to Lucian and Larisa's inconsistent story, I'm attempting to shift suspicion away from myself. I'm also reinforcing my fake Seer claim by confidently sticking to my story about the Mason card in the center. This move puts pressure on Lucian to explain their alliance, potentially exposing weaknesses in their narrative. Additionally, by directly questioning Lucian, I'm positioning myself as proactive and analytical, traits that villagers might exhibit. This strategy aims to maintain my cover while potentially getting a non-Werewolf player eliminated.
> **Selene:** I think we're getting too caught up in my timing and not focusing on the real issue here. The fact remains that there's a Mason card in the center, which directly contradicts Lucian and Larisa's story. They can't both be Masons if one Mason card is in the center. Isn't it more likely that they're the Werewolves trying to throw us off? Lucian, you've been awfully quick to deflect attention onto me. Care to explain how you and Larisa can both be Masons when I saw a Mason card in the center?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's sudden Seer claim contradicts the information Larisa and I have. We've been upfront about being Masons from the start. Her timing and the inconsistency in her information make her the most likely suspect as a Werewolf trying to confuse us.
> **Lucian:** Selene, your claim about seeing a Mason card in the center is extremely suspicious. Larisa and I both know we're Masons, so either you're lying or there's something you're not telling us. I'm accusing you of being a Werewolf trying to create confusion.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By passionately defending my position and redirecting suspicion back to Lucian and Larisa, I'm attempting to maintain my cover as the Seer while also pushing the group towards eliminating a non-Werewolf player. The emotional tone and logical argument about the Mason card inconsistency aim to make my story more believable and cast doubt on Lucian and Larisa's alliance. This strategy keeps the focus off me and Marius while potentially leading to the elimination of a village team member.
> **Selene:** I can't believe we're still debating this! Lucian, your accusation against me is clearly a desperate attempt to divert attention from yourself and Larisa. The facts don't lie: I saw a Mason card in the center, which means you two can't both be Masons. Your story is falling apart, and it's becoming increasingly obvious that you're the Werewolves here. Everyone, we need to focus on this inconsistency rather than my timing of revealing information. Isn't it more likely that I, as the Seer, was cautious about when to share my knowledge, rather than two supposed Masons somehow existing when one Mason card is in the center?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene's sudden Seer claim and the timing of her revelation are highly suspicious. She provided information late in the discussion, which raises doubts about her authenticity. Additionally, her claim of seeing a Mason card in the center contradicts Lucian and Larisa's mutual confirmation of being Masons. Given the inconsistencies and the overall behavior, it seems more plausible that Selene is trying to sow confusion as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Ileana [Seer]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's late reveal of seeing a Mason card in the center contradicts the information Larisa and I have as confirmed Masons. Her timing and the inconsistency in her explanation suggest she's trying to create confusion, which is typical Werewolf behavior. Voting for Selene seems like the best course of action to eliminate a potential threat.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's sudden claim of being the Seer and seeing a Mason card in the center contradicts the information I have as a Mason and the fact that Lucian is the other Mason. Her timing of revealing this information seems too convenient and suspicious. Additionally, Ileana's claim of seeing two Villager cards in the center aligns with Lucian and my understanding that we are both Masons. Therefore, I believe Selene is likely a Werewolf or Minion trying to create confusion.
> **Larisa [Mason]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate a villager. Voting for Lucian serves multiple purposes: it supports Selene's claim, which indirectly helps my fellow Werewolf; it eliminates a potential threat (if Lucian is indeed a Mason); and it maintains my facade of being a concerned villager trying to solve the puzzle. This vote aligns with the suspicions I've raised throughout the game, making it seem like a logical choice for a villager to make.
> **Marius [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager to increase our chances of winning. Lucian seems to be a strong voice against me and potentially a Mason or Seer, making him a threat to the Werewolf team. By voting for Lucian, I'm staying consistent with my false Seer claim and the narrative I've built throughout the game. This vote also helps protect Marius, my fellow Werewolf, by keeping suspicion away from him. Eliminating Lucian would weaken the village team significantly.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Mason : 2
* Selene : Werewolf : 3



>***GAME:*** Selene was killed. The villagers win.
