## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Larisa and Stefan. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dragos. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Ileana. They are thinking about their action.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me more information about the roles that are not in play. This will help narrow down the possibilities of what roles the other players might have, making it easier to identify the Werewolves or Minion during the Day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.


---

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing what I saw in the center, it narrows down the possible roles that other players could have. This helps us focus on identifying the Werewolves or other roles that are in play.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, I'll start. I saw the Mason and Minion cards in the center, so we know those roles aren't in play.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** I know one Mason card is in the center, but by questioning Ileana about the specifics, we can verify the accuracy of her claim and potentially catch her in a lie if she's not being truthful. This will help us identify whether she is indeed a Seer or perhaps a Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive us.
> **Dragos:** Ileana, I find it interesting that you claim to have seen both the Mason and Minion cards in the center. Can you specify which exact positions the cards were in?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Dragos seems a bit eager to discredit my claim. I want to hear from Larisa next to see if she can provide any information that aligns or conflicts with what I revealed.
> **Ileana:** The Mason and Minion cards were in the middle positions. However, the exact positions don't matter as much since they aren't in play. What matters is we need to focus on identifying who might be the Werewolves.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my partner Stefan. By questioning Ileana's claim and involving Dragos, I'm trying to create doubt and confusion among the villagers. This also helps me appear engaged and concerned about finding the truth, which is how a villager might act. Additionally, by asking Dragos for his opinion, I'm subtly trying to gauge if he might be the Seer or another role that could pose a threat to us Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Hmm, Ileana's claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center is quite convenient. It almost feels like she's trying to eliminate suspicion from those roles too quickly. Dragos, I appreciate you asking for more details. What do you think about her response? Do you find it credible?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's skepticism of Ileana's claim aligns with my own doubts. By asking Larisa to provide more details, we can gather more information that might help us determine whether Ileana is telling the truth or if she's trying to mislead us.
> **Dragos:** Larisa, you seem skeptical of Ileana's claim, which I find interesting. Can you share any information you might have that could help us discern the truth here?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and my partner Stefan. By redirecting the conversation towards the Seer role and targeting Alexia, who hasn't spoken yet, I'm attempting to create confusion and potentially expose the real Seer if they exist. This also helps me appear proactive in trying to gather information, which is how a villager might act. Additionally, by bringing up the Seer, I'm indirectly challenging Ileana's claim about the center cards, as the Seer could potentially contradict her statement.
> **Larisa:** I appreciate your question, Dragos, but I'm afraid I don't have any specific information that could confirm or deny Ileana's claim. However, I find it odd that no one has mentioned anything about the Seer yet. Alexia, you've been awfully quiet. Did you perhaps see anything interesting last night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's skepticism of Ileana without providing any new information seems suspicious to me. By pressing her for more details, we might uncover something useful or catch her in a lie.
> **Alexia:** Larisa, I find it interesting that you were quick to cast doubt on Ileana's claim but didn't offer any additional information yourself. Can you tell us more about your own role or what you might have seen last night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover while also shifting suspicion onto others. By addressing Alexia's question and then immediately turning it back on her, I'm attempting to appear cooperative while also putting pressure on a potential villager. This could help identify the Seer or other important roles without revealing my true identity. Additionally, by claiming to work 'for the good of the village,' I'm trying to build trust with the other players while remaining vague about my actual role.
> **Larisa:** Alexia, I understand your suspicion, but I think you're misinterpreting my intentions. I'm not trying to cast doubt; I'm simply trying to gather more information. As for my role, I'm afraid I can't reveal it directly, but I can say that I'm working for the good of the village. What concerns me more is that you seem to be deflecting attention away from yourself. Can you tell us what you were doing last night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been actively questioning others, which is a good strategy, but we haven't heard any information from him directly. Getting him to share what he knows could either validate his intentions or reveal inconsistencies. If he's been quiet about his role, it might help us understand his position better.
> **Alexia:** Dragos, Larisa raises a valid point. You've been asking questions, but we haven't heard much about your role or any observations from last night. Can you share what you know?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know for sure that one Mason card is in the center, which partially verifies Ileana's claim. However, because she's so specific and quick to eliminate suspicion from herself and others, it gives me the feeling she's trying to manipulate the information to her advantage. This makes me suspect that she might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive us.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, here's what I think. Ileana claimed to see both the Mason and Minion cards in the center, but I'm the Mason, and I know one of the Mason cards is definitely in the center. This makes Ileana's claim partially true but also suspicious. It could be a convenient half-truth to cover her tracks if she's a Werewolf or Minion. I find it a bit too convenient that she 'saw' both cards that could eliminate suspicion from those roles. I think we should focus on Ileana and see if her story holds up under more scrutiny.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to create doubt about Dragos' claim of being a Mason. By questioning why he didn't speak up earlier, I'm attempting to undermine his credibility and create confusion among the villagers. This also helps deflect attention away from myself and my partner Stefan. Additionally, by cautioning against jumping to conclusions, I'm trying to slow down the process of identifying the Werewolves while appearing thoughtful and fair-minded.
> **Larisa:** Whoa, hold on a second, Dragos! That's quite an accusation against Ileana. If you're really the Mason, why didn't you speak up earlier when Ileana first made her claim? It seems awfully convenient that you're only revealing this information now. Are you sure you're not just trying to throw us off the scent? I think we need to be careful about jumping to conclusions here.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana's specific claim is partially true but also raises suspicion. Pressing her for more details could potentially reveal inconsistencies in her story, helping us determine whether she's telling the truth or trying to deceive us. As the only Mason, I know one Mason card is in the center, and her convenient claim could be a tactic to cover her tracks.
> **Dragos:** Larisa, I understand your skepticism, but I didn't speak up earlier because I wanted to gather more information before making a direct accusation. I find Ileana's claim suspicious because she gave a very specific account that conveniently clears her of being a Werewolf or Minion. If she's lying about being the Seer, it could mean she's trying to mislead us. So, Ileana, let's get back to you. Can you explain why you chose to look at those specific cards in the center and not at another player's card? Were you trying to hide something?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Dragos's sudden claim to be a Mason only after I revealed the Mason card in the center is very suspect. If he were truly a Mason, he would have spoken up sooner. This makes me believe he's trying to deflect attention from himself, possibly because he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Ileana:** Dragos, you're claiming to be a Mason, but your timing and the convenience of your accusation are incredibly suspicious. Why didn't you say anything earlier? Were you waiting to see how the conversation would go before deciding on a target?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia's lack of information and evasiveness is suspicious. If she has something to hide, we need to press her for details to see if we can uncover any inconsistencies in her story.
> **Dragos:** Alexia, you've been deflecting questions and haven't provided any concrete information about your role or observations. Given the circumstances, I think there's a good chance you're hiding something. Can you explain why you've been so quiet and evasive?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim is now partially contested by Dragos, who says he's a Mason. If she's lying about being the Seer, she could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us. Her reasoning for looking at those specific cards could reveal more about her intentions.
> **Alexia:** Ileana, your claim about seeing the Mason and Minion cards in the center seemed convenient at first, but Dragos's reveal as a Mason complicates things. Why did you choose to look at those specific cards and not at another player's card? Were you trying to hide something?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Dragos is acting suspiciously by claiming to be a Mason only after I revealed the Mason card in the center. If he were truly a Mason, he would have spoken up immediately. His delayed response and attempt to discredit me suggest he's trying to deflect suspicion from himself.
> **Ileana:** Dragos, your sudden claim to be a Mason after I revealed the Mason card in the center is highly suspect. If you were really a Mason, you would have spoken up sooner. Your timing makes me think you're trying to deflect attention from yourself because you're a Werewolf or Minion.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana's statement about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center is suspicious because it conveniently eliminates suspicion from those roles. Given that I know one Mason card is in the center, her claim seems like a calculated move to deceive us. By pressing her further, we can uncover inconsistencies and discern her true intentions.
> **Dragos:** Ileana, your claim doesn't add up. You said you saw the Mason and Minion cards in the middle, but I know for a fact that one Mason card is in the center. Your convenient half-truth makes me think you're trying to cover your tracks. Everyone, we need to consider the possibility that Ileana could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us!


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Larisa's actions seemed to deflect attention without offering any useful information, which is suspicious behavior. We need to understand her role better to determine if she's hiding something important.
> **Ileana:** Larisa, your initial skepticism of my claim about the center cards and your reluctance to share any concrete information about your own role are raising red flags for me. Can you clarify why you haven't been more forthcoming?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and my partner Stefan. By directing the conversation towards Stefan, who hasn't spoken yet, I'm attempting to make him appear suspicious while also giving him an opportunity to defend himself or potentially mislead the group. This also helps me appear proactive and concerned about finding the Werewolves, which is how a villager might act. Additionally, by framing the question in a way that asks for helpful information, I'm subtly pushing Stefan to come up with a plausible story that doesn't incriminate us, while also potentially exposing other roles if Stefan chooses to accuse someone else.
> **Larisa:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting sidetracked here. We need to focus on finding the Werewolves, not bickering among ourselves. Stefan has been awfully quiet throughout this whole discussion. Stefan, what's your take on all of this? Do you have any information that could help us identify the Werewolves?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Larisa. By targeting Ileana, who has made a questionable claim, I can appear as a concerned villager while also creating doubt about a potential Seer. This also indirectly supports Dragos, who isn't a Werewolf, making me seem more credible. By asking Ileana to explain, I'm putting her on the spot and potentially causing more chaos among the villagers, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Stefan:** I've been listening carefully to everyone's claims, and I must say, I find Ileana's story quite suspicious. Claiming to have seen both the Mason and Minion cards in the center seems like a convenient way to clear herself of suspicion. Dragos's revelation about being a Mason directly contradicts part of her claim. Ileana, can you explain this discrepancy?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Dragos's claim to be a Mason only after I revealed the Mason card in the center is highly suspicious. If he were truly a Mason, he would have spoken up immediately. His delayed response and attempt to discredit me suggest he's trying to deflect suspicion from himself, possibly because he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Ileana [Seer]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana's claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center is suspicious. As the only Mason, I know one Mason card is definitely in the center, making her claim partially true but also potentially deceptive. Her specific and convenient claim seems like a tactic to cover her tracks, suggesting she might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us. Voting for her will help us test the credibility of her story and potentially identify her true role.
> **Dragos [Mason]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and Stefan. Ileana's claim about the center cards has been challenged by Dragos, making her a perfect target. By voting for her, I'm reinforcing the suspicion against her while appearing to act in the village's interest. This move also helps protect Stefan, my fellow Werewolf, from scrutiny. Voting for Ileana is a strategic choice that maintains my cover and increases our chances of winning.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center is suspicious, especially after Dragos revealed himself as a Mason. Her story has inconsistencies and seems like a convenient way to clear herself of suspicion. Voting for Ileana seems like the best move to identify a potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Alexia [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate potential threats. Ileana's claim about seeing both Mason and Minion cards in the center is questionable, especially after Dragos revealed himself as a Mason. By voting for Ileana, I can appear as a concerned villager while potentially eliminating the Seer or creating doubt about her role. This also indirectly supports Dragos, who isn't a Werewolf, making me seem more credible. Voting for Ileana helps protect my fellow Werewolf, Larisa, and creates more chaos among the villagers, benefiting our team.
> **Stefan [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


The votes were:
* Ileana : Seer : 4
* Dragos : Mason : 1



>***GAME:*** Ileana was killed. The werewolves win.
