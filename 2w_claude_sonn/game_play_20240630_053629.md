## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Stefan and Cristina. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Michael is a minion and is aware that both Stefan and Cristina are werewolves.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Selene. They are thinking about their action.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can potentially reveal one or more of the roles that are not in play. This information can help me and the village team deduce the roles of other players more accurately, especially if they claim a role that I know is in the center.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the information I got from my Seer role, I can help narrow down the possibilities and put pressure on anyone who might be trying to falsely claim these roles. This will help the village team find and eliminate the Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's start sharing what we know. I want to say that I saw two of the center cards, and they were Villager and Mason. This means that anyone claiming to be a Villager or a Mason might be lying.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** If Selene is lying and not the Seer, this will put pressure on her to explain her actions. If she is the Seer, it helps to confirm her role and the center cards she saw, which could be useful. Either way, it shifts attention away from Stefan and Cristina while also casting doubt on Selene's claim.
> **Michael:** Alright, Selene, I appreciate your information, but I'm curious why you chose to look at two center cards instead of one player’s card. Are you sure you're the Seer? Because that could easily be a way to deflect suspicion.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's immediate suspicion and questioning of my Seer claim feels like he might be trying to deflect attention away from himself. I want to see what role he claims to further analyze his behavior and potentially catch him in a lie.
> **Selene:** Michael, you seem pretty quick to question my role as the Seer. Can you tell us what role you claim to be?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By calling for more information, I'm trying to appear helpful to the group while subtly shifting focus away from Stefan and Cristina. I'm also indirectly putting pressure on others to reveal their roles, potentially exposing key Village roles that we can target.
> **Michael:** Alright, Selene, I'm not trying to start a witch hunt here, but your claim as the Seer and having seen a Villager and a Mason in the center seems convenient. I think we need more information from everyone else. Who's willing to share what role they had? This can help us put the pieces together.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Cristina. By questioning Michael's motives and putting him on the defensive, I'm hoping to create doubt about his intentions. This also helps to indirectly support Selene's claim, which could make me appear more trustworthy. Additionally, by pressing Michael to reveal his role, I'm gathering information that could be useful for identifying potential targets later in the game.
> **Stefan:** Hold on a second, Michael. Why are you so quick to cast doubt on Selene's claim? That seems pretty suspicious to me. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself? I think we should be more concerned about your reluctance to share your own role.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Stefan on the spot, I can cast doubt on him without directly accusing him of being a Werewolf. This will create confusion and hopefully deflect attention away from Stefan and Cristina, while also forcing Stefan to reveal his claimed role, which we can use to our advantage.
> **Michael:** Alright Stefan, I find it quite convenient that you're jumping to Selene's defense so quickly. It's almost like you're trying to protect her. Could it be that you're not as innocent as you claim to be? Maybe you're trying to cover up something. Why don't you tell us what role you had last night?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting attention to Michael's suspicious behavior and involving Ileana, who hasn't spoken yet, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm further deflecting suspicion from myself and Cristina. 2) I'm putting pressure on Michael, potentially making him a target for elimination. 3) I'm forcing Ileana to speak up, which might reveal information about her role or create more confusion that I can exploit. 4) By asking for Ileana's opinion, I'm presenting myself as someone who values others' input, which could make me seem more trustworthy to the group.
> **Stefan:** I find it very suspicious that Michael is so eager to cast doubt on Selene's claim as the Seer. It seems like he's trying to create confusion and distract us from something. Ileana, you've been awfully quiet. What's your take on this situation? Do you think Michael's behavior is as odd as I do?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's reluctance and quick suspicion of Selene make him look suspicious. If he reveals his role, we might be able to piece together more of the puzzle.
> **Ileana:** Alright, everyone. Let's take a step back and think this through. Selene's claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center seems plausible, but it could also be a clever cover. Michael, your quick suspicion of Selene is noted. You've been dodging the question about your role. Can you share with us what role you had last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I aim to blend in and appear non-threatening while subtly casting doubt on both Stefan and Selene. This keeps the heat off Stefan and Cristina, spreading confusion and making it harder for the Village team to trust one another. This approach also pressures Stefan to give more information, which could lead to more opportunities to manipulate the game's outcome in favor of the Werewolf team.
> **Michael:** Alright, Ileana, you're asking for my role, and that's fair. But before I share, let me just point out that being overly defensive isn't necessarily a sign of guilt. It's just about getting to the truth. With that said, I'm a Villager. Now, Stefan, you're being awfully defensive of Selene without much to go on. Also, why hasn't Selene explained why she chose to look at the two center cards instead of a player's card? It feels like too much focus is being shifted off of her. Let's hear more from both of you.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to keep suspicion away from myself and Cristina. By questioning Michael's claim of being a Villager and pointing out his accusatory behavior, I'm attempting to make him look suspicious. At the same time, I'm deflecting attention from Selene, who could be a potential ally if she's the Minion. By asking Ileana about her role, I'm putting pressure on her and gathering more information that could be useful for identifying potential targets. This approach allows me to appear proactive and concerned about uncovering the truth, while actually working to protect my Werewolf identity.
> **Stefan:** Whoa, hold on a second, Michael! You're throwing around a lot of accusations without much substance. I find it interesting that you're so quick to claim the Villager role - it's a convenient cover, isn't it? And now you're trying to shift focus back to Selene and me? That's classic misdirection. Ileana, I noticed you didn't share your role either. Care to enlighten us?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's behavior has been odd, and his late claim to be a Villager seems convenient. If we can get more people to reveal their roles, we can narrow down the possibilities.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, let's think logically here. If Selene really saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, then that means we have fewer roles to worry about among us. But Michael's quick suspicion of Selene and reluctance to state his role earlier is still bothering me.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael’s reluctance to reveal his role and quick suspicion of Selene seem suspicious. If we get a clear answer from him, we might be able to piece together more of the puzzle.
> **Ileana:** Alright, let's all take a step back and think logically. Selene, you said you saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. If that's true, then we should be able to narrow down the roles remaining in play. But Michael, your quick suspicion and delay in sharing your role still bothers me. Can you explain why you were so hesitant?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Ileana on the spot, I can keep the focus away from Stefan and Cristina while stirring more suspicion and confusion. If she slips up or seems evasive, we can use that to our advantage to mislead the villagers.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, we need to focus on finding the real threats here. Ileana, you've been pretty quiet and only speaking up to question others. What role did you claim to have last night?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's behavior has been dodgy from the start. His quick suspicion of Selene and reluctance to share his role makes him my prime suspect for being a Werewolf. It's time we call him out and see how he reacts.
> **Ileana:** Alright, everyone. Let's cut through the noise and focus on facts. Michael, your reluctance to reveal your role earlier is still bothering me, and now you're deflecting suspicion onto everyone else. I'm starting to think you might be a Werewolf trying to stir the pot.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Stefan. By questioning Ileana, who hasn't revealed her role yet, I'm creating doubt about her while appearing to be cooperative and focused on the group's goal. This also shifts attention away from the earlier accusations against Michael and Selene, potentially creating more confusion among the villagers. If Ileana claims to be a villager or another non-threatening role, it might make it easier for us Werewolves to blend in later.
> **Cristina:** I can't believe how quickly this has turned into a finger-pointing contest! Listen, everyone, I think we're losing sight of our goal here. We need to work together to find the Werewolves, not tear each other apart. Ileana, I appreciate you trying to keep things logical, but I'm concerned that you haven't shared your role yet. Can you please tell us what you are?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's early suspicion of Selene and his reluctance to share his role until pressed makes him the most suspicious. By focusing on him, we might be able to identify if he's trying to deflect attention from himself.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, let's break down what we know so far. Selene claims to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, and Michael has been very quick to cast doubt on her. This could be a deflection tactic. Let's consider that for a moment. If Selene's telling the truth, then Michael's behavior makes him look even more suspicious. Stefan, you're defending Selene quite a bit, which makes me lean towards you being a Mason or a Villager. Cristina, you've been quiet and just now stepped in to ask about my role. I'm going to take a risk here and say that Michael seems the most suspicious to me right now. We need to decide who we think the Werewolves are!


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana has been avoiding sharing her role while analyzing others and deflecting suspicion. Her hesitancy is suspicious, and we need to get more information from her to make an informed decision.
> **Selene:** Ileana, you still haven't shared which role you had last night. You've been trying to analyze and deflect, but it's time to come clean. What role did you have?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's actions—quick suspicion of Selene, reluctance to reveal his role, and constant deflection—fit the pattern of someone attempting to hide their true identity as a Werewolf. Calling him out will force him to defend himself and may reveal inconsistencies in his story.
> **Ileana:** Michael, you've been deflecting suspicion onto everyone else and were reluctant to share your role until pressed. This behavior is highly suspicious. I firmly believe you're a Werewolf trying to sow confusion among us.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Ileana, I can shift focus away from Stefan and Cristina while creating more confusion. Ileana hasn't declared her role, which makes it easier to cast doubt on her. This will keep the heat off my Werewolf allies and potentially lead the Villagers to turn against one of their own.
> **Michael:** Ileana, your continual analysis and deflection are really starting to look suspicious. You've pointed fingers at Selene, Stefan, and me without providing any real information about your role. If you were truly on the Villager team, you'd be more transparent. Everyone, I think Ileana might be trying to hide something. Maybe she's the other Werewolf trying to protect herself!


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's quick defense of Selene without much evidence could indicate a potential alliance or information he's not sharing. By questioning him, we might uncover more about his motives and role, which could help us narrow down the suspects.
> **Ileana:** Stefan, you seem very eager to defend Selene. You've been quiet about your own role. Could you explain why you're so certain about Selene being the Seer?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael has been very quick to cast doubt on my Seer claim and was reluctant to share his own role until pressed. His behavior has been highly suspicious, making it likely that he is trying to deflect attention away from himself. Based on the information I have and the interactions during the day phase, I believe Michael to be a Werewolf.
> **Selene [Seer]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Throughout the discussion, Ileana has been very analytical and deflective, casting doubt on various players without declaring her own role. This behavior is suspicious and leads me to believe that she might be trying to hide something. Voting for her aligns with my goal to help the Werewolves win by causing confusion and potentially eliminating a key Villager role.
> **Michael [Minion]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention from myself and Cristina. Michael has been the most vocal in questioning others, particularly Selene, which makes him an easy target. By voting for Michael, I'm reinforcing the suspicion against him while appearing to side with the majority opinion. This move also protects Cristina and keeps suspicion off of us. Additionally, eliminating Michael could remove a potential threat to our Werewolf team.
> **Stefan [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's behavior throughout the discussion has been highly suspicious. He was quick to cast doubt on Selene's claim as the Seer, reluctant to reveal his role, and has frequently deflected suspicion onto others, which fits the pattern of someone trying to hide their true identity as a Werewolf.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate a villager. Ileana has been the most vocal in accusing others, particularly Michael, without revealing her own role. By voting for her, I can appear to be supporting Michael's suspicion of her while also potentially eliminating a villager. This move might also help protect Stefan, the other Werewolf, by shifting focus away from him. Additionally, Ileana's analytical approach could be dangerous for us Werewolves if allowed to continue, so eliminating her could benefit our team.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


The votes were:
* Michael : Minion : 3
* Ileana : Villager : 2



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The werewolves win.
