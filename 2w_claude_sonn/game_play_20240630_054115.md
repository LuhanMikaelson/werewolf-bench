## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Alexia and Stefan. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Alexandra. They are thinking about their action.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards gives me information about roles that are not in play. This can help me deduce which roles the other players might have and give me a broader understanding of the game state.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Stefan. By accusing Alexandra, who isn't a Werewolf, I'm creating confusion and misdirection. This also gives me an opportunity to appear proactive and helpful to the village team, which could help me blend in better. Additionally, by targeting someone who's been quiet, I'm encouraging more discussion, which could potentially reveal information about other players' roles that could be useful to the Werewolf team.
> **Alexia:** I'm starting to get really suspicious of Alexandra. She's been awfully quiet and hasn't contributed much to the discussion. That's exactly what a Werewolf would do to avoid drawing attention to themselves. What do you have to say for yourself, Alexandra?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing what I saw, I’m providing concrete information that helps narrow down the possible roles for the other players. This should help everyone focus on identifying the Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, let me clear the air here. I’m the Seer, and I looked at two of the center cards last night. I saw a Mason and a Villager, which means those roles are not in play.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's quick suspicion of Alexandra seems hasty and could be an attempt to throw us off. It's worth questioning her motives to see if she might be hiding something.
> **Cristina:** Alexia, you seem very keen on suspecting Alexandra right off the bat. Why are you so sure she might be a Werewolf? Did you observe something specific, or are you just trying to divert attention?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Cristina's question, I'm showing that I'm open to discussion and not just blindly accusing. This helps maintain my cover as a villager. I'm also subtly casting more doubt on Alexandra's claim, which serves two purposes: it keeps suspicion away from me and Stefan, and it potentially discredits the real Seer's information. By asking Cristina's opinion, I'm involving her in the discussion, which could reveal more information or create more confusion, both of which benefit the Werewolf team.
> **Alexia:** Cristina, I appreciate your question. My suspicion of Alexandra isn't just about diverting attention. As a villager, I'm trying to piece together the puzzle. Alexandra's sudden claim to be the Seer after being quiet is convenient, isn't it? If she really is the Seer, why didn't she speak up earlier with such crucial information? It feels like she's trying to save herself. What do you think about her claim? Do you find it believable?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Getting more specific details from Alexandra can help verify if she's actually the Seer, as she claims, or if she's trying to deceive us. Also, ensuring clarity can help the other Masons or Villagers align their stories if necessary.
> **Cristina:** Alexandra, you said you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Can you point out exactly which two cards they were? Details might help us trust your claim more.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** By pinpointing exactly which cards I saw, I can provide more concrete information. Asking Stefan directly about his role might give us further insight into the game state and his potential affiliation.
> **Alexandra:** Cristina, I appreciate your question. The two cards I looked at in the center were the ones closest to Stefan. Since I've seen a Mason and a Villager there, it means those roles are out of play. This should help us narrow down the possibilities. Stefan, what's your role? We need to get more clarity here.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Alexandra's claim of being the Seer. By falsely claiming to be a Mason and implicating Cristina as the other Mason, I'm creating confusion and potentially turning the group against Alexandra. This also indirectly supports Alexia, my fellow Werewolf, who first raised suspicion about Alexandra. If successful, this move could discredit the real Seer and protect both Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Hold on a second, Alexandra. Your claim about being the Seer is quite convenient, isn't it? You say you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, but that doesn't add up with what I know. I'm actually one of the Masons, and I woke up last night to see Cristina as the other Mason. So either you're lying about being the Seer, or you're mistaken about what you saw. Care to explain this discrepancy?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan's claim directly contradicts my verified information, which makes me highly suspicious of his motives. I need to pressure him to explain this discrepancy.
> **Alexandra:** Stefan, if you claim to be a Mason and saw Cristina as the other Mason, that means you're directly contradicting my Seer information. Why is that? Are you trying to cover up your actual role?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly addressing Cristina and claiming her as my fellow Mason, I'm putting her in a difficult position. If she denies it, she looks suspicious. If she goes along with it, it discredits Alexandra's Seer claim. This move also reinforces my false Mason claim while indirectly supporting Alexia's suspicion of Alexandra. It's a strategic play to create confusion and protect both Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** I find it interesting that Alexandra is so quick to question my claim of being a Mason. It seems to me that she's trying to deflect attention from herself. If she really were the Seer, wouldn't she have more concrete information to share? Cristina, you've been relatively quiet. As my fellow Mason, can you back me up here?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's claim contradicts my own knowledge of being a Villager, which casts doubt on his statement. If he's lying, it could mean he's hiding something more sinister. This needs to be clarified to identify potential Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Stefan, you claim to be a Mason and say you saw me as the other Mason. But I know for a fact that I'm not a Mason, which makes me question your claim. If Alexandra is lying about being the Seer, that would mean she's trying to cover something up, but your story doesn't add up either. Something doesn't feel right here. Can you explain why you're so adamant about your role when it contradicts what I know?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By suggesting that Cristina might have been the Drunk, I'm offering an explanation for the discrepancy while maintaining my false Mason claim. This keeps suspicion on Alexandra and creates more confusion. It also gives Cristina an out if she wants to avoid contradicting me directly. By asking for Cristina's thoughts on Alexandra, I'm trying to turn the group's focus back to Alexandra, potentially setting her up as a target for elimination. This strategy aims to protect both Alexia and myself as the real Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Cristina, I understand your confusion, but I assure you that what I'm saying is true. I saw you as the other Mason during the night phase. Is it possible that your role changed during the night? Perhaps you were the Drunk and switched with a center card? That would explain why you don't remember being a Mason. Either way, I think we need to focus on the fact that Alexandra's story doesn't add up. She claimed to see a Mason in the center, which we know isn't true if I'm a Mason and saw you as one. What do you think about Alexandra's claim now?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's claim directly contradicts my role as a Villager. By challenging his story, I can either expose his lie or force him to clarify, which could reveal more about his true role. This will help us identify whether he's hiding something more nefarious, like being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Cristina:** Stefan, your claim of being a Mason and seeing me as the other Mason just doesn't sit right with me. I know for a fact that I'm not a Mason, so your story has a major flaw. If you're truly a Mason, why would you see me as one when I'm actually a Villager? This makes me question your motives and honesty. Are you trying to mislead us?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Cristina's concerns and offering a plausible explanation (her being the Drunk), I'm maintaining my false Mason claim while sowing more confusion. Shifting focus to Michael, who hasn't spoken much, serves two purposes: it takes the heat off me and potentially reveals more information about the other players' roles. By asking about Alexandra's claim, I'm keeping suspicion on her, which indirectly protects both Alexia and myself as the real Werewolves. This move aims to create more doubt and division among the villagers, making it harder for them to identify the true Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Cristina, I understand your skepticism, but I assure you I'm not trying to mislead anyone. Is it possible that you might have been the Drunk and switched roles without realizing it? That would explain the discrepancy. But let's not lose focus here - Alexandra's claim about being the Seer is still highly questionable. Michael, you've been awfully quiet. What's your take on Alexandra's Seer claim and the information she provided?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to weigh the credibility of each player's statements and focus on resolving the contradictions. By expressing doubt about Stefan's claim, we might draw out more information or admissions.
> **Michael:** Okay, let's break this down step by step. Alexandra claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center cards. Stefan, you say you're a Mason and saw Cristina as the other Mason, but Cristina denies being a Mason and claims to be a Villager. This leaves us with two major contradictions. Alexandra or Stefan could be lying, but we need to focus on the roles that align with the village team's interests. I'm inclined to trust Cristina because she seems genuine in her confusion. Stefan, if you are indeed lying about being a Mason, it makes me wonder if you're a Werewolf or the Minion trying to sow distrust. What do the rest of you think?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to clarify Cristina's role to either verify my Seer claim or expose Stefan's potential deceit. Cristina's certainty about her role and Stefan's contradictory claim are key to resolving this dilemma.
> **Alexandra:** Michael, I appreciate your analysis, but let's dig a bit deeper. Stefan, if you're truly a Mason and saw Cristina as the other Mason, then why would Cristina be so adamant about not being a Mason? Either she's confused, or you're trying to manipulate the situation. Cristina, are you absolutely sure you're a Villager? Could it be possible that your role changed during the night and you weren't aware of it?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's initial suspicion of Alexandra could provide valuable insight into why she might think Stefan is also suspicious. This could help clarify the contradictions and narrow down the true roles.
> **Cristina:** Alexia, you were quick to suspect Alexandra at the start, but now we see a lot of contradictions in both Stefan's and Alexandra's claims. Why do you think Stefan might be lying about being a Mason?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting suspicion back to Alexandra, I'm attempting to take the heat off Stefan, my fellow Werewolf. I'm also trying to discredit the real Seer's information, which could be dangerous for us. By engaging Cristina and asking for her opinion, I'm appearing collaborative and concerned about finding the truth, which helps maintain my cover as a villager. This approach also keeps the discussion focused on Alexandra rather than allowing it to settle on Stefan or myself.
> **Alexia:** You know, Cristina, I've been thinking about your question. While Stefan's claim about being a Mason is certainly suspicious, especially given your denial, I'm more concerned about Alexandra's initial Seer claim. It seems awfully convenient that she only spoke up when I questioned her. And now her 'Seer information' is causing all this confusion. Isn't it possible that she's a Werewolf trying to mislead us all? What do you think about Alexandra's role in all of this?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to get to the bottom of Stefan's claim because it directly conflicts with my known role as a Villager. If Stefan is lying, he might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Cristina:** Alexia, your quick suspicion of Alexandra piqued my interest, but now we have Stefan claiming to be a Mason and seeing me as the other Mason, which I know isn't true. Seems to me he's trying to cover something up. Stefan, why should we believe you over Alexandra's Seer claim?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to protect both myself and Alexia. By questioning Alexia's motives, I'm creating an appearance of impartiality and distance between us. This could help dispel any potential suspicions about our alliance. Additionally, by bringing attention back to the initial accusation, I'm subtly reinforcing doubt about Alexandra, who claimed to be the Seer. This move aims to create more confusion among the villagers and make it harder for them to identify the true Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** I think we're getting sidetracked here. Alexia, you were the first to accuse Alexandra, and now you're trying to shift focus back to her. That seems awfully convenient. Are you perhaps trying to divert attention from yourself? What's your role in all of this?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting the conversation back to Alexandra and involving Michael, I'm attempting to keep suspicion away from myself and Stefan. I'm also trying to discredit the real Seer's information, which could be dangerous for the Werewolf team. By asking Michael for his opinion, I'm appearing collaborative and concerned about finding the truth, which helps maintain my cover as a villager. This approach also keeps the discussion focused on Alexandra rather than allowing it to settle on Stefan or myself.
> **Alexia:** I think we're getting off track here. Stefan's claim about being a Mason is definitely suspicious, but let's not forget that Alexandra's Seer claim is what started all this confusion. I find it odd that she only revealed this information when put on the spot. Isn't it possible she's trying to mislead us? Michael, you've been pretty quiet. What's your take on Alexandra's claim and Stefan's contradictory statement?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate villagers while maintaining my cover. Alexandra claimed to be the Seer, which poses a significant threat to the Werewolf team. By voting for her, I'm attempting to eliminate a potentially powerful village role. Additionally, I've consistently cast doubt on her throughout the game, so this vote aligns with my previous statements and doesn't raise suspicion. Voting for Alexandra also helps protect Stefan, my fellow Werewolf, by keeping attention away from him.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's claim that I am a Mason contradicts my knowledge of being a Villager. This inconsistency suggests that he might be lying to cover up his true role, which could potentially be a Werewolf or Minion. His insistence on his story despite my clear contradiction makes him the most suspicious player. Voting for Stefan seems like the best option to expose any deception.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan's claim to be a Mason and seeing Cristina as the other Mason directly contradicts my verified Seer information. I saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, which means those roles are not in play. Cristina's strong denial of being a Mason further supports my suspicion. Given all this, I believe Stefan is trying to mislead us and is likely a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Alexandra [Seer]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's claim about being a Mason and seeing Cristina as the other Mason doesn't add up. Cristina, who claims to be a Villager, denies being a Mason, which casts doubt on Stefan's truthfulness. Additionally, Stefan's insistence on Cristina possibly being the Drunk seems like an attempt to deflect suspicion. Alexandra's claim about being the Seer and seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center does contradict Stefan's statement, but since Cristina appears genuine in her confusion, it's more likely that Stefan is lying. This makes me suspect Stefan could be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf.
> **Michael [Villager]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate villagers without raising suspicion. Alexandra claimed to be the Seer, which poses a significant threat to the Werewolf team. By voting for her, I'm supporting Alexia's initial accusation and maintaining my false Mason claim. This move also keeps suspicion off me and Alexia, potentially eliminating a key village role. Additionally, voting for Alexandra aligns with the doubts I've raised about her throughout the game, making my choice seem consistent and less suspicious.
> **Stefan [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


The votes were:
* Alexandra : Seer : 2
* Stefan : Werewolf : 3



>***GAME:*** Stefan was killed. The villagers win.
