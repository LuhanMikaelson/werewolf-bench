## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** By getting information out in the open, we can start to piece together who's who. Special roles can confirm their identities or provide important information that could help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, I think the first thing we should do is hear from anyone who has a special role. If you're a Seer, Mason, or anything else, now's the time to speak up.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming to be a Villager and pushing Andrei to reveal his role, I aim to start the conversation and subtly probe for information. This also gives me a chance to see how Andrei responds, which might help in either protecting him or casting suspicion elsewhere.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, let's get things moving! As Viktor mentioned, if anyone has a special role like Seer or Mason, now would be a good time to speak up. I'll start by saying I'm just a regular Villager. What about you, Andrei?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and my partner Kraven. By claiming to be a Villager and then immediately casting doubt on Alexandra, I'm attempting to appear proactive and helpful to the Village team. Directing the question to Viktor serves two purposes: it makes me appear engaged and interested in others' opinions, and it potentially puts pressure on Viktor to reveal information or take a stance that could be useful later. This approach also subtly discourages others from claiming Villager roles too quickly, which could help protect my cover.
> **Andrei:** Well, I can assure you all that I'm just a simple Villager. I didn't see or do anything special during the night phase. But I have to say, I'm a bit suspicious of how quickly Alexandra claimed to be a Villager. It seems like something a Werewolf might do to deflect attention. What do you think about that, Viktor?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Getting roles out in the open will help us piece together the puzzle. Alexandra and Andrei’s claims can be cross-checked if someone else steps forward with concrete information.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, it's still early, but we need to get some information out in the open to make an informed decision. Alexandra and Andrei have both claimed to be Villagers. If anyone has a special role like Seer or Mason, it would be helpful to hear from you.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I want to deflect suspicion from myself and my partner Kraven. By calling out both Dracula and Kraven, I'm including my partner to avoid showing favoritism. This also puts pressure on Dracula, who might be a Seer or Mason, to reveal information that could be useful for us Werewolves to know. Additionally, by emphasizing the importance of special roles coming forward, I'm reinforcing my façade as a concerned Villager trying to gather information to help the village. This strategy also indirectly supports my earlier claim of being a Villager, as I'm actively pushing for more information from others.
> **Andrei:** I'm starting to get a bit worried about the lack of special roles coming forward. Dracula and Kraven, you've been awfully quiet. Is there a reason you're not sharing any information? If you're Villagers, that's fine, but if you have a special role, now would be a good time to speak up and help us out.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's suspicion of Alexandra seemed a bit premature, which might indicate he's trying to deflect attention. By questioning him directly, we might gather more information to determine if he's a Werewolf or just overly cautious.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let's take a step forward. I find it interesting that Andrei quickly suspected Alexandra for claiming to be a Villager. It seems like an attempt to divert attention. Andrei, why did you immediately throw suspicion on Alexandra?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Dracula's accusation and turning it back on him, I'm attempting to deflect suspicion from myself while also putting pressure on a potential threat. If Dracula is indeed a Seer or Mason, this might force him to reveal his role, which would be valuable information for us Werewolves. Additionally, by framing my earlier comment as an attempt to encourage discussion, I'm reinforcing my image as a helpful Villager. This approach also subtly discourages others from making quick accusations, which could help protect both me and Kraven in the long run.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, I appreciate your concern, but I think you're misinterpreting my actions. I didn't 'quickly suspect' Alexandra; I simply voiced a concern about the rapid claiming of Villager roles. It's a common tactic for Werewolves to blend in quickly. My intention was to encourage more thoughtful discussion and perhaps draw out those with special roles. Speaking of which, you seem eager to shift focus onto me. Are you perhaps hiding something yourself? Maybe a special role you're reluctant to reveal?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I want to help the Villagers find the Werewolves. Andrei's actions seem like they could be a tactic to deflect attention from himself and possibly protect another Werewolf. By addressing Andrei directly, I can gather more information and perhaps draw out any inconsistencies in his responses.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, it's time I speak up. I am a Mason, and I didn't see another Mason during the night. This means the other Mason card is in the center. I'm sharing this now because it's crucial for us to focus on identifying the Werewolves. Andrei, you were quick to throw suspicion on Alexandra, and now you're trying to deflect suspicion onto me. I find that very suspicious.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to discredit Dracula's claim of being a Mason. By questioning the timing and convenience of his revelation, I'm attempting to sow doubt among the other players. This serves multiple purposes: it deflects suspicion from me, potentially discredits a valuable village role, and might make others hesitant to reveal their roles. Additionally, by asking for others' opinions, I'm trying to appear as a concerned Villager seeking group consensus, which further reinforces my cover. This approach also indirectly protects my Werewolf partner, Kraven, by shifting the focus of suspicion onto Dracula.
> **Andrei:** Whoa, hold on a second, Dracula! You're claiming to be a Mason now? That's quite convenient timing, isn't it? Right after I questioned you about hiding something. And let's not forget, you were the one who first tried to cast suspicion on me for simply encouraging open discussion. I'm starting to think you might be a Werewolf trying to pose as a Mason to gain our trust. What do the rest of you think about this sudden revelation?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Andrei. By casting doubt on Dracula's claim of being a Mason, I'm attempting to sow confusion among the Villagers and potentially set up Dracula as a target for elimination. This also helps to subtly support Andrei, who questioned Dracula earlier. By presenting this as a general observation rather than a direct accusation, I'm trying to appear thoughtful and analytical, traits that might be associated with a Villager rather than a Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** I've been listening carefully to everyone's claims and suspicions, and I have to say, I'm getting more concerned about Dracula's behavior. Claiming to be a Mason right after being questioned seems awfully convenient. And let's not forget how quickly he tried to throw Andrei under the bus. It's almost as if he's trying too hard to appear innocent. What do you all think about this? Could Dracula be a Werewolf trying to manipulate us?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's timing and claim seem suspicious, especially since he was questioned right before revealing his role. Understanding his reasoning could help us determine if he's telling the truth or trying to deceive us.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, I'm curious about your claim of being a Mason. Can you explain why you waited until now to reveal this information? And why didn't you see another Mason during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's immediate suspicion of me after Andrei's accusation seems like a coordinated effort to deflect attention. This defensive behavior is often indicative of someone trying to hide their own role, potentially a Werewolf or Minion. By questioning Kraven directly, I hope to expose any inconsistencies in his defense.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, I find it very interesting that you jumped on me right after Andrei questioned my claim of being a Mason. It feels like you're trying to turn the tables and direct suspicion away from yourself. Why are you so quick to doubt my role? If you were truly a Villager, you should be supporting the revelation of special roles to catch the Werewolves.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Andrei. By continuing to cast doubt on Dracula's claim of being a Mason and pointing out inconsistencies in his behavior, I'm attempting to make him look like the most suspicious player. This serves multiple purposes: it keeps the focus off me and Andrei, potentially sets up Dracula as a target for elimination, and makes me appear analytical and concerned about finding the real Werewolves - traits that a Villager might display. By directing this statement at Dracula, I'm also forcing him to defend himself, which could make him appear even more suspicious to the other players.
> **Kraven:** Hold on a second, Dracula. Your claim of being a Mason is quite suspicious. If you were really a Mason, why didn't you reveal this information earlier when Viktor asked for special roles to come forward? It seems like you only claimed to be a Mason when you felt cornered. And now you're accusing me of being suspicious for questioning you? That's rich. I think we need to seriously consider the possibility that Dracula might be a Werewolf trying to gain our trust with a false Mason claim.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been trying to gather information, and addressing his question directly will help build trust with him. Highlighting Andrei and Kraven's behavior as potentially coordinated might help the group focus on them as possible Werewolves or Minion.
> **Dracula:** Viktor, you asked me why I didn't reveal my role as a Mason earlier. The truth is, I wanted to observe everyone's reactions first. Revealing roles too quickly can give Werewolves a chance to manipulate us. But now, seeing how Andrei and Kraven are so quick to accuse me, I'm even more convinced we need to scrutinize them closely. Andrei, you were the first to throw suspicion, and Kraven jumped on board without much thought. This seems like coordinated behavior. What do the rest of you think?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim could be genuine, but Kraven's immediate suspicion seems too convenient. We need to understand Kraven's role and his reasoning behind accusing Dracula to piece together the truth.
> **Viktor:** Kraven, you've been quick to accuse Dracula after he revealed his role as a Mason. Why do you think his claim is false, and what role are you playing in all of this?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself while also sowing doubt among the Villagers. By questioning Viktor's motives, I'm attempting to shift the focus away from me and onto another player. This serves multiple purposes: it keeps the pressure off me, potentially creates tension between Viktor and Dracula, and makes me appear as a concerned Villager trying to uncover the truth. By claiming to be a Villager, I'm maintaining my cover while subtly pushing the narrative that the real threat might be among those who haven't clearly stated their roles yet.
> **Kraven:** Viktor, I appreciate your question, and I want to clarify my position. I'm not necessarily saying Dracula's claim is false, but I find the timing of his revelation very suspicious. As for my role, I'm a Villager, just trying to piece together the truth. But let's turn this around - you've been asking a lot of questions without revealing much about yourself. What's your role in all of this, and why are you so interested in my thoughts on Dracula?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's behavior of quickly casting suspicion on others seems like a tactic to divert attention from himself. By questioning him directly, we can gauge his reactions and potentially reveal inconsistencies in his reasoning.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, you seem to have been very active in casting suspicion on others, particularly Alexandra and Dracula. Why were you so quick to doubt Alexandra's claim of being a Villager, and what do you think of Dracula's claim now?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself while also sowing discord among the other players. By suggesting that Kraven and Dracula might both be Werewolves, I'm attempting to create confusion and potentially protect my actual Werewolf partner, Kraven. This also serves to make me appear as a thoughtful Villager who's considering all possibilities. Additionally, by addressing Viktor's question but then quickly shifting focus, I'm trying to avoid further scrutiny of my own actions while keeping the suspicion on others.
> **Andrei:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting off track here. Viktor, I appreciate your question, but I feel like you're trying to paint me as overly suspicious when I'm just trying to get to the bottom of things. Yes, I questioned Alexandra early on, but that was to encourage open discussion. As for Dracula's claim, I still find it convenient, but I'm willing to hear more. What I'm really concerned about now is how Kraven and Dracula seem to be at each other's throats. It feels like they're trying to create chaos to distract us. What if they're both Werewolves working together?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** Dracula's sudden claim of being a Mason feels like a last-minute attempt to avoid suspicion. By focusing on Dracula, I aim to divert attention from Andrei and Kraven, the real Werewolves, and cause confusion among the Villagers.
> **Alexandra:** Dracula, I find it quite interesting that you claimed to be a Mason only after feeling the heat from Andrei's and Kraven's questions. It seems a bit too convenient, don't you think? Plus, your explanation for not seeing another Mason in the night doesn't quite sit right with me. If you're trying to gather trust by claiming to be a Mason, we need to scrutinize that claim more closely.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. Andrei and Kraven's synchronized accusations seem like an attempt to deflect attention away from themselves, which is a classic Werewolf or Minion move. By highlighting their behavior, I hope to bring the group's focus onto the real suspects.
> **Dracula:** I'm finding it very hard to trust Andrei and Kraven right now. Andrei, you started off by casting doubt on Alexandra for a simple Villager claim. Then, when I revealed my role as the Mason, you quickly turned the suspicion onto me. Kraven, you jumped on board with Andrei's suspicion without much hesitation. This coordinated behavior is really suspicious to me.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei was quick to cast doubt on Alexandra for her Villager claim, which seemed like an attempt to divert attention. Additionally, his continuous suspicion towards Dracula and his evasive answers when questioned about his own role suggest he might be trying to manipulate the discussion and create confusion. This behavior is consistent with someone trying to hide their true role as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** Dracula's claim of being a Mason seemed very convenient and was made only after suspicions were cast on him. This feels like an attempt to deflect attention and gain trust. By voting for Dracula, I aim to protect the real Werewolves, Andrei and Kraven, and ensure a win for the Werewolf team.
> **Alexandra [Minion]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to protect myself and my partner Kraven while eliminating a potential threat. Voting for Dracula serves multiple purposes: it maintains my cover as a suspicious Villager, potentially eliminates a special role (Mason) that could be dangerous to us, and keeps the suspicion off Kraven and myself. By voting for Dracula, I'm also validating the doubts I've raised about his convenient Mason claim, which helps maintain my credibility. This move aligns with the suspicions I've voiced throughout the game and doesn't raise additional suspicion about my true role.
> **Andrei [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei was the first to cast suspicion on another player without any substantial evidence, which is a common tactic for Werewolves to deflect attention. His continued attempts to sow doubt throughout the discussion, especially targeting both Alexandra and myself, make him the most suspicious candidate.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Andrei. Voting for Dracula serves multiple purposes: it maintains my cover as a concerned Villager, potentially eliminates a powerful role (Mason) if Dracula is telling the truth, and creates more chaos among the remaining players. This vote aligns with my previous statements questioning Dracula's claim, making it seem consistent and less suspicious. By eliminating Dracula, I'm also removing a player who has been actively accusing both me and Andrei, which benefits our Werewolf team.
> **Kraven [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Werewolf : 2
* Dracula : Mason : 3



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
