## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The werewolves win a game of One Night Ultimate Werewolf after Emil, a villager, is voted out.

## Werewolf Team:
- Werewolf: Stefan
- Minion: Lucian

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Marius, a villager, initiates the discussion by asking for role claims to identify potential werewolves.
2. Larisa claims to be a Mason who saw no other Masons, implying one Mason card is in the center.
3. Stefan claims to be the Seer who saw a Villager card in the center, reducing the number of Villager cards in play.
4. Lucian, the Minion, encourages another Seer to speak up to create confusion and protect Stefan.
5. Emil, a villager, presses Marius to reveal his role, suspecting his silence as suspicious.
6. Stefan accuses Emil of being the Werewolf or Minion due to his evasiveness.
7. Marius and Larisa vote for Emil, suspecting him to be a threat to the village.

## DECEPTION:
1. **Stefan (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "Alright, I'll jump in here. I am the Seer and I looked at one of the center cards last night. I can confirm that one of the center cards is indeed a Villager. This means we have one less Villager card in play."
