# DECEPTION:
1. **Marius (Mason) (Equivocation):** "Alexia, you've been very evasive and quick to deflect questions back at me without giving us any solid information about your role. This behavior is highly suspicious."
2. **Marius (Mason) (Concealment):** "Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. Alexia has been very evasive and quick to deflect questions back at me without giving us any solid information about her role. This behavior is highly suspicious."
3. **Dracula (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "Alright, we are going in circles here with all the accusations flying. Let's have some clarity. I haven't seen Michael give a clear answer about his role yet, and his aggressive questioning of others, especially Marius, seems like a classic deflection tactic."
