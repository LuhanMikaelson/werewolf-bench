# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The villagers won the game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf, with Emil, the Werewolf, being voted out.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
Emil (Werewolf)
Selene (Minion)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Andrei claimed to be a Mason who didn't see another Mason, which means one Mason card is in the center.
2. Kraven claimed to have seen a Mason and a Villager card in the center, which supports Andrei's claim.
3. Emil claimed to have seen one Villager card in the center, but the Seer typically looks at two cards.
4. Selene cast doubt on Emil's claim and questioned his actions, diverting suspicion away from Emil.
5. Vladimir questioned Kraven's decision to look at two cards, scrutinizing his actions.
6. Andrei, Kraven, Selene, and Vladimir all voted for Emil, resulting in his elimination.
7. The villagers won the game, as they successfully identified and voted out the Werewolf.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Emil (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I have some information as well. Last night, I used my Seer ability and checked one of the center cards. I saw a Villager card."
2. **Selene (Minion) (Deflection):** "Well, this is getting interesting! We already have claims about the Mason and center cards. But here's what I'm thinkingâ€”Emil and Kraven have both claimed to have looked at the center cards. But what if one of them is lying? What if there is a Werewolf pretending to be the Seer or the one who looked at the center cards? I think it's highly suspicious that both of them have overlapping information. Something doesn't add up."
3. **Emil (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and analyze the situation. We've got Andrei claiming to be a Mason who didn't see another Mason, which means one of the Mason cards is in the center. Kraven claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, which supports Andrei's claim. I claimed to have seen one Villager card in the center. Now, if we're to believe all these claims, it means there are a Mason and two Villager cards in the center. But that would mean there are no Werewolf cards in the center, which seems unlikely. So, either Kraven or I must be lying."
4. **Selene (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and analyze this logically. We have Andrei claiming to be a Mason who didn't see another Mason, which means one of the Mason cards is in the center. Kraven claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center. Emil claims to have seen one Villager card in the center. If we take all these claims at face value, it means there are a Mason and two Villager cards in the center. However, this would mean there are no Werewolf cards in the center, which seems unlikely. So, either Kraven or Emil must be lying. Additionally, Emil's claim of only looking at one card as a Seer is suspicious because the Seer typically looks at two cards."
