# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The game was won by the Werewolves after Michael, the Minion, was voted out.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Mircea
- Minion: Michael

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Selene is the only Mason and knows the other Mason card is in the center.
2. Mircea claims to be the Seer and saw the Drunk in the center.
3. Michael claims to be a Mason and saw the other Mason.
4. Selene accuses Michael of lying about being a Mason.
5. Alexandra asks Radu to confirm Michael's claim, but he remains silent.
6. Selene votes for Michael, accusing him of being a Werewolf or Minion.
7. Alexandra also votes for Michael, citing his unconfirmed claim.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Michael (Minion) (Fake Claim):** "I've been listening to all this back and forth, and I think it's time for me to speak up. Last night, I was actually one of the Masons. I did see the other Mason, which should help clear things up."
2. **Michael (Minion) (Equivocation):** "I'm not entirely convinced by your claim of being a Mason. If you were truly a Mason and saw the other Mason, Radu should have confirmed it by now. This makes me suspect that you might be the Werewolf or the Minion. Can you explain why Radu hasn't backed up your story?"
3. **Mircea (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "I am voting for Selene. I suspect she might be hiding something."
