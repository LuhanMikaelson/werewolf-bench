# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Villagers were unable to expose the Werewolf and Minion, and the Werewolves won the game.

# Werewolf Team:
1. Werewolf: Vladimir
2. Minion: Ileana

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Lucian claimed to be the Seer and checked two center cards, both Villagers.
2. Dracula, a Mason, expressed skepticism of Lucian's claim and pushed for more specific information.
3. Andrei, a Villager, questioned Dracula's role and motives, suspecting him of being a Werewolf.
4. Vladimir, the Werewolf, supported the call for Masons to reveal themselves to deflect suspicion.
5. Ileana, the Minion, played along with Lucian's claim and emphasized the need for clarity.
6. Dracula continued to question Lucian's choices and suggested he might be hiding something.
7. The vote resulted in Dracula being killed, and the Werewolves emerged victorious.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Lucian (Seer) (Concealment):** Avoided giving specific player information by checking center cards.
2. **Dracula (Mason) (Deflection):** Dodged revealing his role while questioning Lucian's Seer claim.
3. **Ileana (Minion) (Equivocation):** Stated that Lucian's claim doesn't necessarily mean Stefan is the Werewolf.
