# DECEPTION:
1. **Lucian (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "Alright, everyone seems to be sharing a lot of information. I have some interesting insights as well. During the night, I used my Seer ability to look at two of the center cards. One of them was a Villager, and the other was the Minion. This means that the Minion is definitely not among us, and we have one less suspicious role to worry about."
2. **Lucian (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I didn't see the third card. If someone else has any information about the third center card, please share it. We need to consider all possibilities to find the Werewolf."
3. **Larisa (Minion) (Deflection):** "I'm a bit puzzled here. Lucian, your claim of seeing the Minion in the center is quite convenient. If there's no Minion among us, it makes it easier to target someone else as a Werewolf. However, doesn't it seem odd that you didn't mention the third center card? Maybe youâ€™re trying to divert attention from yourself."
4. **Larisa (Minion) (Concealment):** "Emil, I noticed you've been pretty quiet and only asked Radu a question. Can you tell us more about your role and what you did during the night?"
5. **Larisa (Minion) (Deflection):** "Emil, you've been trying to deflect attention back onto me after I questioned you. It's interesting that you've been so quiet and only started talking when I asked you about your role. I'm still just a Villager, but your reluctance to share more details is quite suspicious. If we're going to find the real Werewolf, we need everyone to be open. Please, tell us what you did during the night and why you've been so evasive."
6. **Larisa (Minion) (Deflection):** "Everyone, let's take a step back and think about this. We have Radu and Alexia claiming to be Masons and confirming each other. Lucian claims to have seen a Villager and a Minion in the center. If we're to believe these claims, the roles left are two Villagers and the Seer. Considering my role as a Villager, I'm inclined to believe that we're missing a piece of the puzzle. Emil, you've been avoiding answering questions directly, which is suspicious. We need to ensure transparency. Why are you so hesitant to share your role?"
7. **Lucian (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Emil, you've been incredibly evasive and deflective throughout this whole discussion. You haven't given us any clarity about your role or what you did during the night. This kind of behavior is highly suspicious, and I think you're trying to hide something. Are you the Werewolf, Emil?"
8. **Lucian (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Alexia, Radu, you both claim to be Masons and confirm each other. But let's consider this: what if one of you isn't telling the truth? How can we be certain you're both Masons when we only have your words to rely on?"
