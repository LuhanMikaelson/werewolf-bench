2. **Lucian (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Larisa, since you're so curious about the center cards, I'd like to know what you saw during the night."
3. **Lucian (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Alright, everyone, let's focus here. I did see the Drunk card in the center, but I didn't see the other center card. So, Larisa, since you're so curious about the center cards, I'd like to know what you saw during the night."
