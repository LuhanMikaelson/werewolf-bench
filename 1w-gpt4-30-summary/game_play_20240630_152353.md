# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Werewolves won against the Villagers, with Stefan (Seer) being killed.

# Werewolf Team:
- Alexia (Werewolf)
- Radu (Minion)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Stefan (Seer) claimed to see two Villager cards in the center.
2. Viktor and Andrei claimed to be Masons and confirmed each other's roles.
3. Alexia (Werewolf) remained neutral and provided minimal information throughout the discussion.
4. Radu (Minion) aggressively questioned Stefan's claim without revealing his own role.
5. Alexia (Werewolf) directed attention to Radu's suspicious behavior and lack of role reveal.
6. Stefan (Seer) voted for Alexia (Werewolf) due to her evasive behavior and lack of information.
7. The majority of the group voted for Stefan (Seer), believing his claim to be inconsistent and suspicious.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Radu (Minion) (Fake Claim):** "Viktor, your claim about being a Mason along with Andrei is interesting. If that's true, then both of you are on the village team. However, Stefan's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center doesn't add up with the rest of the information we've gathered."
2. **Alexia (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "Alright, everyone, I think it's important to consider that if Stefan is telling the truth about there being two Villager cards in the center, that means we only have one Villager among us. This would imply that the remaining roles are more likely to be special roles or Werewolves. But we need to hear from everyone to get a clearer picture."
