# DECEPTION:
1. **Andrei (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "Alright everyone, let's get this discussion started. I'll come clean and let you all know that I'm a Villager."
2. **Mircea (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright, let's try to get some clarity here. I didn't see anything during the night because I was just a humble Villager as well. However, I find it interesting that Andrei was so quick to claim being a Villager. It almost feels like he's trying to hide something."
3. **Mircea (Minion) (Equivocation):** "Alright, Semira, I see where you're coming from. Yes, I did cast doubt on Andrei, but that's only because I want us to be thorough in our investigation."
4. **Radu (Mason) (Equivocation):** "Alright, Semira, you've been dodging the question long enough. What exactly is your role? Are you the Seer, or do you have something to hide?"
5. **Andrei (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "Larisa, you seem quite certain that two of the Villager cards are in the center. How do you know this information? Did you look at the center cards, or are you claiming a specific role?"
6. **Mircea (Minion) (Concealment):** "Larisa, you mentioned two Villager cards, but you haven't clarified the third card in the center. If you really are the Seer, this information is crucial."
