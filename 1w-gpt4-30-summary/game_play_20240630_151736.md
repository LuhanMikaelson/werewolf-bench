# DECEPTION:
1. **Radu (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "Alright, let's piece this together carefully. I was the Seer last night, and I looked at two of the center cards. One of them was the Werewolf card, which means itâ€™s in the middle."
2. **Dracula (Villager) (Equivocation):** "Okay everyone, I think we need to hear from Stefan now. Stefan, you've been deflecting questions and pointing fingers without giving us any concrete information. Can you explain your role and what you did last night?"
3. **Stefan (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am just a humble Seer, trying to deduce who the werewolves could be."
4. **Stefan (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Alright everyone, let's think this through. Radu claims to have seen a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. If that's true, then we should have one more special role among us. Andrei, you still haven't provided any information about what you saw or did. Can you share anything useful from last night?"
