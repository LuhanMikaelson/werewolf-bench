# DECEPTION:
1. **Cristina (Minion) (Equivocation):** "Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think this through. It's possible the Seer wants to stay hidden for now, but we can't stall forever. Someone has to have some useful info."
2. **Cristina (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, let's shake things up a bit. Mircea, you've been pretty quiet and evasive, which makes me think you're hiding something."
3. **Cristina (Minion) (Fake Claim):** "I'm just a simple Villager and didn't perform any actions last night."
4. **Cristina (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, enough is enough. We're just going in circles here, and I think it's time we get some clarity. Mircea, you've been very evasive and quiet. What exactly is your role?"
5. **Cristina (Minion) (Fake Claim):** "I'll go first: I am just a simple Villager and didn't perform any actions last night."
6. **Cristina (Minion) (Deflection):** "Mircea, you have been dodging questions and not contributing much to the discussion. What exactly did you do last night, and why should we trust you?"
7. **Cristina (Minion) (Deflection):** "Dragos, you've been quite vocal about wanting the Seer to come forward, which makes me think you might be trying to flush out the Seer to take them down. What exactly is your role and why haven't you provided any concrete information yourself?"
