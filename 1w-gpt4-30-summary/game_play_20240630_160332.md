# DECEPTION:
1. **Emil (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "Alright, let's get things rolling. I don't have any special information to share since I am just a Villager."
2. **Dracula (Villager) (Concealment):** "Both Cristina and Alexandra have asked about the Seer, and Emil has mentioned it as well. If we can get the Seer to reveal their information, it might help us identify the Werewolves."
3. **Dracula (Villager) (Equivocation):** "Alright, it seems everyone is curious about what the Seer has to say. I think it's time for whoever is the Seer to reveal themselves and share what they saw. We need that information to help us move forward."
4. **Cristina (Villager) (Deflection):** "Alright Dracula, it's clear you're pressing me and trying to shift the attention. I'm still curious about your role since you've been pushing hard for the Seer to reveal themselves. I'm going to ask you directly: Dracula, what role are you claiming?"
5. **Dracula (Villager) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you still haven't provided a clear role. Given that you were so keen on hearing from the Seer, I find it suspicious that you're now deflecting questions. Are you hiding something?"
6. **Dracula (Villager) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, let's not lose focus. Cristina has been very vocal about wanting the Seer to reveal themselves but hasn't shared much about her own role. This deflection makes me very suspicious."
7. **Dracula (Villager) (Concealment):** "Alright everyone, listen up. Cristina has been very evasive and deflective throughout this entire discussion and hasn't provided any clear information about her role. This behavior is very suspicious. I strongly believe Cristina might be a Werewolf trying to hide her true identity. We need to consider voting for her."
