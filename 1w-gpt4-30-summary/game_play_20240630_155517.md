# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The werewolves lost a game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf, where villagers successfully identified and voted off the werewolf.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Alexia
- Minion: Semira

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Semira and Selene confirm each other as Masons.
2. Alexia and Dragos make conflicting claims about being the Seer.
3. Alexia claims to have seen the Drunk and a Villager in the center, while Dragos claims to have seen the Villager and Minion.
4. Dragos calls out Alexia's claim, while Alexia questions Dragos's timing and motives.
5. Lucian finds Alexia's reasoning for checking the center cards less convincing.
6. Semira, Selene, and Lucian vote for Alexia.
7. Dragos also votes for Alexia, as her claim directly contradicts his Seer claim.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Alexia (Fake Claim):** "I am the Seer, and I saw the Drunk and a Villager in the center."
2. **Alexia (Deflection):** "Why would I risk making a detailed claim about the center cards if I were lying?"
3. **Alexia (Concealment):** "Why didn't you speak up first if you were truly the Seer?"
4. **Alexia (Equivocation):** "It makes no sense for a Werewolf to provide contradictory information knowingly."
