# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Werewolves won the game by convincing the Villagers to kill the Minion, Ileana.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Alexia
- Minion: Ileana

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Alexia, the Werewolf, claimed to be the Seer and saw the Werewolf and Minion in the center, clearing all other players.
2. Ileana, the Minion, questioned Alexia's claim and pushed for Masons to reveal themselves.
3. Dragos and Emil, as Villagers, suspected Ileana and questioned her motives.
4. Viktor, as Mason, voted for Ileana due to her persistent skepticism of Alexia's claim.
5. Ileana voted for herself to redirect suspicion away from Alexia.
6. Emil voted for Alexia because her claim seemed convenient and lacked specific information.
7. Dragos and Alexia both voted for Ileana due to her aggressive questioning and suspicious behavior.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Alexia (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am the Seer, and last night I looked at two of the center cards. One of them was the Werewolf card, and the other was the Minion card."
2. **Ileana (Minion) (Concealment):** "I think it is more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
3. **Ileana (Minion) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you're accusing me of classic Werewolf behavior, but you haven't shared your role yet."
4. **Ileana (Minion) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
