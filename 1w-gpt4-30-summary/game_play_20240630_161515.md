# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Dracula
- Minion: Semira

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The seer, Ileana, saw that Andrei was the Mason.
2. Dracula claimed to be the Seer and said he saw the Drunk and Villager in the center.
3. Viktor questioned Dracula's claim, as he did not reveal this information immediately.
4. Andrei accused Viktor of being a Werewolf or Minion due to his constant deflection and lack of information.
5. Dracula supported Andrei's accusation and urged the group to vote for Viktor.
6. Marius also questioned Dracula's delayed reveal of information and voted for him.
7. Ileana, the true Seer, voted for Dracula, indicating he was either a Werewolf or Minion.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Dracula (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am the Seer, and I saw the Drunk and Villager in the center."
2. **Dracula (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I didn't see a Werewolf card in the center."
3. **Dracula (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Your question makes me curious about your role. Are you trying to gather information to help the village, or are you strategically positioning yourself? I'd like to know what role you have."
4. **Dracula (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Alright, everyone, I think it's time we focus on something crucial. We've had a lot of back-and-forth about my claim as the Seer, but let's not forget the bigger picture. If I were really trying to deceive you, why would I provide concrete information about the center cards? Let's consider who has been deflecting and avoiding giving concrete information about their own roles. Andrei, you've been quiet and haven't shared much. What's your role in all of this?"
