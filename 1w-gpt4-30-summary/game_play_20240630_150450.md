# DECEPTION:
1. **Dracula (Mason) (Equivocation):** "Alright, let's get some clarity here. Since Vladimir is claiming to be a Villager, I'm curious about what Mircea and Radu have to say. What roles are you both claiming?"
2. **Dracula (Mason) (Equivocation):** "I find it hard to believe that we have three Villagers in this game. The odds seem off. Mircea, you've been pretty vocal so far. Are you sure you're not hiding something?"
3. **Dracula (Mason) (Equivocation):** "Mircea, you've been pretty vocal and quick to cast doubt on others. That behavior is quite typical for someone trying to control the narrative and blend in."
4. **Dracula (Mason) (Equivocation):** "Everyone, I think Mircea's behavior has been overly aggressive and controlling. It's a classic tactic for someone trying to blend in while steering the conversation."
5. **Dracula (Mason) (Equivocation):** "I find it very odd that Mircea has been so vocal and aggressive in steering the conversation. This kind of behavior is typical of someone trying to control the narrative and blend in as a Villager."
6. **Dracula (Mason) (Equivocation):** "I think we're missing the bigger picture here. We've had three Villager claims, which statistically seems unlikely with the roles in play."
7. **Dracula (Mason) (Equivocation):** "I find it extremely suspicious that Mircea has been so quick to accuse and steer the conversation without providing any substantial proof. This is a classic tactic of deflection and control, which is common for Werewolves trying to blend in."
8. **Dracula (Mason) (Concealment):** "I think it is more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
9. **Vladimir (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I think it's important to get some clarity early on. I'm going to start by claiming that I'm a Villager. I know it's not much, but it's the truth."
