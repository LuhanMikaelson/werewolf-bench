# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Villagers won the game by voting to kill the Werewolf, Cristina.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Cristina
- Minion: N/A

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Cristina claims to be the Seer and says she looked at two center cards.
2. Michael, a Mason, doubts Cristina's claim because a Seer would typically look at player cards.
3. Larisa, also a Mason, agrees with Michael's suspicion.
4. Alexandra votes for Cristina because she finds her claim suspicious.
5. Dragos votes for Michael because he is suspicious of his behavior.
6. Michael votes for Cristina because he believes she is a Werewolf.
7. Larisa votes for Cristina because she agrees with Michael's suspicion.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Cristina (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am the Seer, and during the night I decided to look at two of the center cards."
2. **Cristina (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Dragos, you have been quite passive during this discussion. You havenâ€™t really contributed any substantial information or claims about your role."
3. **Michael (Mason) (Concealment):** "Larisa, I know you are a fellow Mason, and we need to work together to figure this out. Cristina's claim to be the Seer and looking at two center cards doesn't add up. This is not what a real Seer would do. I strongly believe she's trying to mislead us and is actually a Werewolf."
