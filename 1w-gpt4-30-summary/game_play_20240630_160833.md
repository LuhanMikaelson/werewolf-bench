# DECEPTION:
1. **Viktor (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright, Mircea, since you and Cristina have come forward as Masons and Radu claims to be the Seer, I think it's crucial we get some clarity here. If Radu is truly the Seer and saw the Drunk and Villager in the center, then he should have no problem in corroborating further details. But here's something that bothers me â€“ if we have two Masons and one Seer accounted for, why hasn't the other Villager or the Minion come forward yet? It seems like we're missing some key pieces here."
2. **Viktor (Minion) (Concealment):** "Alright everyone, let's take a step back and review the information we have so far. Mircea and Cristina have both claimed to be Masons and have vouched for each other. Radu has claimed to be the Seer and stated that he saw the Drunk and a Villager in the center cards. Now, here's my concern: if Radu truly saw those cards in the center, why would he check the center cards instead of other players? That seems suspicious to me. And Alexandra, you've been very quiet this whole time without revealing your role. If we're going to figure this out, we need full transparency from everyone. So, Alexandra, what role are you claiming?"

4. **Viktor (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, let's be real for a moment. Radu's claim of being the Seer seems dubious to me because, as I've mentioned, if he were truly the Seer, he would have checked a player, not the center cards. And Alexandra, your continued silence is just adding to my suspicion. Cristina and Mircea, if you're truly Masons, you should be just as worried about these inconsistencies. We need to get to the bottom of this and ensure we're not being misled."

6. **Viktor (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, let's think this through logically. We have Mircea and Cristina both claiming to be Masons, and they have vouched for each other. Radu has claimed to be the Seer and mentioned seeing the Drunk and a Villager in the center cards. Now, if we take Radu's claim at face value, we have accounted for the Drunk and one Villager card in the center. That leaves one unknown card in the center and all of us here. Alexandra, you've been very quiet and haven't given us any information about your role. If we want to clear things up, we need everyone to be transparent. So, Alexandra, what role are you claiming?"
