## DECEPTION:
1. **Dracula (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am the Seer, and during the night, I looked at one of the center cards. I can confirm that one of those cards is indeed a Villager."
2. **Marius (Minion) (Deflection):** "Dragos, I’ve noticed you’ve been quite vocal about questioning Mircea and Dracula, but you haven’t given us much information about your own role."
3. **Mircea (Seer) (Concealment):** "I did see something interesting during the night. When I looked at two of the center cards, I saw a Mason and a Villager. This means that at least one of the roles that people might claim to be is not actually in play."
