# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The villagers won by correctly identifying Alexandra as the Werewolf in a game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf.

# Werewolf Team:
- Alexandra (Werewolf)
- Semira (Minion)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Cristina claimed to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center.
2. Andrei claimed to be the Mason and knew one Mason card was in the center.
3. Alexandra initially claimed to see a Villager in the center, then added the Drunk card after being questioned.
4. Semira questioned Alexandra's credibility and suggested she might be protecting a Werewolf.
5. Andrei directly questioned Alexandra's changing story and her motives.
6. Viktor pointed out the inconsistencies in Alexandra's story and her suspicious behavior.
7. All players voted for Alexandra, resulting in her elimination and the victory of the villagers.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Alexandra (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am just a humble Seer, trying to deduce who the werewolves could be."
2. **Alexandra (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I think it is more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
3. **Alexandra (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think about this carefully. We've heard conflicting Seer claims from both Cristina and myself, and Andrei has mentioned being the Mason who knows the other Mason card is in the center. Semira, you seem to be taking a very reactive stance, questioning others but not offering much insight yourself. This hesitation makes me wonder if you're hiding something."
4. **Semira (Minion) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
5. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you're accusing me of classic Werewolf behavior, but you haven't shared your role yet."
