# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The werewolves won by deceiving the villagers and causing them to vote for the seer.

# Werewolf Team:
- Radu (Werewolf)
- Semira (Minion)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Radu claimed to be the Seer and checked a center card, finding a Villager.
2. Michael claimed to be the Seer and checked Larisa's card, finding a Villager.
3. Dragos was the Mason.
4. Selene and Larisa were Villagers.
5. Michael, Dragos, Larisa, and Selene voted for Michael, while Radu voted for Michael.
6. Michael was killed and the werewolves won.
7. Michael's claim to have checked Larisa's card was less strategic than checking the center cards.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Radu (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I saw one of the Villager cards, so at least we know that one of the villagers is in the center."
2. **Radu (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "It's interesting that you are claiming to be the Seer. If you really checked Larisa's card and she's a Villager, then why didn't you check one of the center cards to get more information for us all?"
3. **Radu (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Alright, it's getting a bit heated here with two Seer claims. Let's think this through calmly. If I'm the Seer and I saw a Villager in the center, it means we have one less Villager in play, which means more room for Werewolves to maneuver."
4. **Radu (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Alright, things are heating up. If Radu is the Seer and checked a center card to find a Villager, that makes sense strategically. But Michael claiming to have checked Larisa's card instead of a center card sounds off to me."
5. **Radu (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, let's not forget that we have three Villager cards and one is definitely in the center. So, out of the remaining roles, we should focus on uncovering the Werewolves."
6. **Radu (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Selene, you've been aggressively questioning Dragos and trying to steer the conversation towards him. Could you please tell us what role you are claiming and why you haven't revealed it yet?"
7. **Radu (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, let's think this through step by step. We have two conflicting Seer claims here, and it's crucial that we figure out which one is lying. Radu checked a center card and found a Villager, which makes strategic sense because it provides broad information. Michael, on the other hand, claims to have checked your card and found a Villager. This seems less strategic since checking the center would have been more helpful to the village. This discrepancy makes me very suspicious of Michael."
8. **Michael (Seer) (Concealment):** "By looking at Larisa's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or another important role. This information can help guide the discussion during the Day phase and either confirm her as a fellow Villager or expose her as a threat."
9. **Dragos (Mason) (Deflection):** "Alright, we have a situation here. We have two people claiming to be the Seer, which means one of them is definitely lying. Michael, if you're the real Seer and you checked Larisa's card, can you tell us why you didn't check the center cards? Given the limited information, I'm leaning towards Radu being more suspicious since checking the center cards seems like a safer bet for a Seer."
10. **Dragos (Mason) (Deflection):** "Selene, you seem very eager to question me. What's your role in all of this?"
11. **Dragos (Mason) (Deflection):** "Alright, things are heating up. Selene claiming to have checked Larisa's card instead of a center card sounds off to me."
12. **Dragos (Mason) (Deflection):** "Selene, you're being awfully quiet and only focused on me. That's pretty suspicious behavior if you ask me. Are you hiding something?"
13. **Dragos (Mason) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, I think we need to focus on Michael here. His claim of being the Seer and checking Larisa's card instead of a center card doesn't make much sense strategically. Why would a real Seer prioritize checking another player's card when they could have given
