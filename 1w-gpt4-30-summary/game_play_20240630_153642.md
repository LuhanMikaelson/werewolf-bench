# DECEPTION:
- **Lucian (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "Alright everyone, let's get to the bottom of this. I am a Mason and I saw the other Mason last night. This means we have a strong village team."
- **Lucian (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "Hold on, Alexandra. If you're claiming to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, that just means the other Mason card is in the center. It's not proof that I'm lying."
- **Lucian (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "Alright, let's break this down carefully. Kraven, you said you saw two Villager cards in the center, right? That suggests the Villager roles are accounted for. Alexandra, you claim you're the Mason and didn't see anyone, which suggests the other Mason card is in the center. This contradiction needs to be resolved. Dragos, you haven't said much yet. Can you share if you have any special role or information that might help us clarify this situation?"
- **Lucian (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Alright everyone, let's piece this together step by step. Kraven claims he saw two Villagers in the center, which, if true, means that the Villager roles among us are accounted for and any claims to Villager roles among us are false. This makes things tricky. If Alexandra is truly a Mason and didn't see another Mason, it suggests one Mason is in the center. But that doesn't align with my claim. Can we get more clarity on what roles everyone is claiming? This might help us find inconsistencies."
- **Alexandra (Mason) (Concealment):** "Hold up everyone, something isn't right here. Lucian just claimed to be a Mason and saw another Mason last night. But I am the real Mason and I didn't see anyone. That means Lucian is lying and trying to mislead us."
- **Alexandra (Mason) (Concealment):** "Kraven, I'm not convinced by your claim about seeing two Villagers in the center. Can you be more specific about which cards you saw and why we should trust you?"
- **Dragos (Minion) (Equivocation):** "Alright everyone, I think we need to carefully analyze the information we've got so far. Lucian claims to be a Mason and saw another Mason. Alexandra claims to be a Mason but didn't see anyone, suggesting the other Mason card is in the center. Kraven claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, which means the Villager roles among us are accounted for. This leaves us with a major contradiction. Could it be that one of you is the Minion trying to protect a hidden Werewolf?"
- **Dragos (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright everyone, let's think about this step by step. Lucian claims to be a Mason and saw another Mason, which implies both Masons should be in play. On the other hand, Alexandra claims to be a Mason but didn't see anyone, which suggests the other Mason card is in the center. Kraven claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, which would mean no additional Villagers are in play among us. This leaves us with a major contradiction. Marius, you've been pretty quiet. Do you have any special role or information that might help us clarify this situation?"
