# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The werewolves won a game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf with four votes against the villager.

# Werewolf Team:
- Selene [Werewolf]
- Larisa [Minion]

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Selene saw a Werewolf card in the middle during the night phase.
2. Larisa claimed to be a Mason and knew that Selene was a Werewolf.
3. Marius and Kraven claimed to be the two Masons in the game.
4. Viktor claimed to be a Villager.
5. Viktor questioned Larisa's Mason claim, and Marius and Kraven backed him up.
6. Selene claimed to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf card and a Villager card in the middle.
7. Viktor accused Larisa of being the Minion protecting a hidden Werewolf.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Larisa (Minion) (Fake Claim):** "I am one of the Masons."
2. **Kraven (Mason) (Concealment):** "I can't confirm Selene's Seer claim, but I think it's more important to identify suspicious behavior."
3. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you're accusing me of classic Werewolf behavior, but you haven't shared your role yet."
4. **Semira (Minion) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
