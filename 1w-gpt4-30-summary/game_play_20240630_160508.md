6. Alexia questions Stefan's Mason claim and attempts to shift suspicion.
7. Stefan accuses Viktor of being on the Werewolf team.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Viktor (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "I actually looked at one of the center cards last night, and I saw the Villager card there. This means we can account for one less Villager among us."
2. **Alexia (Minion) (Concealment):** "Alright, Stefan, you claim to be a Mason and that the other Mason card is in the center. Letâ€™s assume you're telling the truth for now. But let's dig deeper. If anyone else has information about the center cards, now is the time to speak up."
3. **Viktor (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "Alright, everyone, I understand that my timing might seem suspicious, but let's evaluate the information we have so far. Stefan claims to be a Mason and that the other Mason card is in the center. If that's true, we can cross that off. I saw a Villager card in the center, which further narrows things down."
4. **Alexia (Minion) (Deflection):** "Stefan, you claim to be a Mason and that the other Mason card is in the center, but Viktor's sudden claim about seeing a Villager card in the center makes me question the consistency of your statements. If you're genuinely a Mason, can you provide any additional details or reasoning to support your claim?"
5. **Marius (Villager) (Deflection):** "Alexia, you've been very keen on getting information from the Seer but haven't shared much about yourself. Why don't you tell us your role and any information you have?"
