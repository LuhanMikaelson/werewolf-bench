# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
In a game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf, the Werewolves won after Cristina, a Villager, was voted off.

# Werewolf Team:
- Michael (Werewolf)
- Andrei (Minion)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Cristina suggested hearing from the Seer first to gather information.
2. Marius questioned Cristina's motives for wanting the Seer to reveal themselves.
3. Andrei deflected suspicion from Michael by calling out Marius's quick suspicion.
4. Michael questioned Cristina's motives to deflect attention from himself.
5. Cristina challenged Marius's suspicion to reveal inconsistencies in his reasoning.
6. Marius pressed Cristina on her insistence for the Seer to reveal themselves to catch her in a lie.
7. Andrei questioned Cristina's motives to keep suspicion on her and deflect it from Michael.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Stefan (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am just a humble Seer, trying to deduce who the werewolves could be."
2. **Dracula (Seer) (Concealment):** "I think it is more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
3. **Semira (Minion) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you're accusing me of classic Werewolf behavior, but you haven't shared your role yet."
4. **Semira (Minion) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
