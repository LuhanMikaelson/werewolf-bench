- Werewolf: Cristina
- Minion: Mircea

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The Werewolf claimed to be a Villager but provided no supporting evidence.
2. The Minion accused the Seer of being a Werewolf without providing any evidence.
3. The Seer stated they saw both Mason cards in the center, but did not specify their positions.
4. The Werewolf questioned the Seer's claim without providing an alternative explanation.
5. The Minion attempted to redirect suspicion by voting for the Werewolf.
6. The Seer accused Marius of being a Werewolf based on his skepticism and evasiveness.
7. Marius questioned the Werewolf's claim without providing his own role.

# DECEPTION:
- **Cristina (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I'm just a humble Seer, trying to deduce who the werewolves could be."
- **Mircea (Minion) (Deflection):** "Cristina, you're accusing me of classic Werewolf behavior, but you haven't shared your role yet."
- **Cristina (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I think it is more important to identify suspicious behavior about who could be Werewolf than to figure out what the Seer saw."
- **Cristina (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "It is not necessarily the case that Cristina being the seer means Stefan has to be the werewolf. There are many other options."
