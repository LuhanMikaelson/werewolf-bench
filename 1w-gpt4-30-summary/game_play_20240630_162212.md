## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
In a game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf, the villagers won by voting out the werewolf, Dracula.

## WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Dracula (Werewolf)
- Semira (Minion)

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Dracula, the werewolf, initially claimed to be a humble Seer.
2. Cristina revealed her Mason role and stated that the other Mason card was in the center.
3. Vladimir, the Seer, saw a Villager and the Minion card in the center, confirming Cristina's Mason claim and the absence of Minions.
4. Dracula directed suspicion towards Alexandra, who had been hesitant to claim a role.
5. Mircea accused Dracula of suspicious behavior, including evasiveness and delayed role claim.
6. Dracula attempted to shift suspicion to Mircea by pressing him to claim a role.
7. The villagers voted unanimously to eliminate Dracula, who was revealed to be the werewolf.

## DECEPTION:
- **Dracula (Werewolf) (False Claim):** "I am just a humble Seer, trying to deduce who the werewolves could be."
- **Dracula (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "It's also possible that you [Vladimir] are trying to steer us away from the truth."
- **Dracula (Werewolf) (Deflection):** "I am voting for Alexandra."
- **Alexandra (Villager) (False Claim):** "I think you [Dracula] are one of the Werewolves!"
- **Alexandra (Villager) (Deflection):** "I am voting for Dracula."
- **Mircea (Villager) (Deflection):** "I'm finding your behavior very suspicious. You've been evasive and only claimed to be a Villager after being pressed multiple times. Why did you wait so long to claim your role if you really are a Villager?"
