# DECEPTION:
- **Selene (Villager):**
 - **Concealment:** (To Vladimir) "But I want to know, what did you see or do? Any useful information for us?"
 - **Concealment:** (To Vladimir) "If you didn't see anything, why not ask Andrei what he saw or did last night?"
- **Andrei (Minion):**
 - **Concealment:** (To Vladimir) "However, I want to shake things up a bit."
 - **Equivocation:** (To Vladimir) "Alright everyone, it seems like we have multiple claims of being Villagers, which makes sense given the number of Villager cards in play."
- **Vladimir (Mason):**
 - **Fake Claim:** (To the group) "Alright, everyone, let's cut to the chase. I'm highly suspicious of Selene's claim of being a Villager."
 - **Deflection:** (To Selene) "Selene, you're being really evasive and haven't given us any clear information."
- **Viktor (Werewolf):**
 - **Deflection:** (To the group) "Alright everyone, here's what I think. We've heard a lot from Vladimir and Selene, and both seem very defensive."
