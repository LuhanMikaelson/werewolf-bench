# DECEPTION:
1. **Larisa (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I'm the Seer and last night I looked at one of the center cards. It was the Drunk."
2. **Larisa (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I find it quite suspicious that the Seer hasn't come forward yet."
3. **Alexia (Villager) (Equivocation):** "If we can confirm the Seer and their information, it will help us narrow down the suspects further and potentially identify the Werewolves."
4. **Alexia (Villager) (Deflection):** "Stefan, you've been very quick to steer the conversation and ask others for their roles, but you haven't shared anything about what you saw or did during the night. Are you hiding something?"
5. **Vladimir (Villager) (Deflection):** "Alexia, you've been very aggressive but haven't provided any concrete information yourself."
6. **Vladimir (Villager) (Deflection):** "Stefan, you seem very eager to point fingers and steer the conversation, but you haven't shared any information about what you saw or did during the night."
7. **Stefan (Villager) (Concealment):** "Identifying the Masons will help us confirm some people as safe and focus our efforts on finding the Werewolves."
