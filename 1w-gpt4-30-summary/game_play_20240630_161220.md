# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Werewolves won a game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf, with Vladimir being killed by the villagers.

# Werewolf Team:
- Selene (Werewolf)
- Semira (Minion)

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Alexia, the Seer, confirmed that the Mason and Minion cards were in the center.
2. Vladimir was consistently evasive and deflected questions without revealing his role.
3. Semira deflected suspicions and avoided clearly stating her role.
4. Dragos took some time to claim Villager but did so under pressure.
5. Selene's Villager claim aligned with Alexia's Seer claim.
6. Semira confronted Vladimir and accused him of being a Werewolf.
7. The villagers voted to kill Vladimir, and the Werewolves won.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Vladimir (Equivocation):** "I find it strange that Dragos hasn't claimed a role yet."
2. **Vladimir (Deflection):** "I'm growing increasingly suspicious of Semira. She hasn't clearly stated her role and has been deflecting suspicions onto others without providing useful information."
3. **Semira (Concealment):** "I didn't see any Masons during the night, which means the Mason card must indeed be in the center, confirming Alexia's Seer claim."
4. **Semira (Deflection):** "Vladimir, you're dodging every single question thrown your way. It's clear to me nowâ€”you're hiding something major, and I believe you're the Werewolf!"
5. **Dragos (Equivocation):** "Alright, I've been keeping my thoughts to myself to gather more information, but it's clear now that Vladimir is being very evasive."
6. **Semira (Concealment):** "Dragos, you've been very quiet and your Villager claim only came after a lot of pressure. I'm finding that highly suspicious."
