# DECEPTION:
1. **Radu (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I drew a Villager card. I know it's not the most exciting role, but the truth is what it is."
2. **Andrei (Villager) (Deflection):** "Mircea, I think it's crucial to get more information about the roles in play. You've vouched for Ileana, but that doesn't completely clear her in my eyes."
3. **Stefan (Minion) (Concealment):** "I am voting for Andrei."
4. **Stefan (Minion) (Equivocation):** "Alright, everyone, I understand the need for clarity and open discussion. We've heard from Mircea, who claims to be the Seer and vouched for Ileana. Radu has claimed to be a Villager but has been quite quiet initially."
5. **Stefan (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright, everyone, I think we can all agree that we've heard a lot of claims and counterclaims, but there's still a lot of uncertainty. Mircea's claim as the Seer and vouching for Ileana has a logical consistency to it, and Radu's late claim of being a Villager is somewhat questionable. But what really stands out to me is Andrei's continuous reluctance to share his role."
6. **Radu (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "Alright, everyone, we need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture here."
7. **Mircea (Seer) (Concealment):** "Alright, everyone, based on everything we've heard so far, Mircea's claim as the Seer seems plausible and he's vouched for Ileana. Radu's late claim of being a Villager is raising red flags for me."
8. **Andrei (Villager) (Concealment):** "I am voting for Radu."
9. **Andrei (Villager) (Deflection):** "Throughout the discussion, Radu has been very defensive and delayed in revealing his role, which raises suspicion."
