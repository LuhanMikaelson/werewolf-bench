# DECEPTION:
1. **Emil (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I'm voting for Selene."
2. **Emil (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "I've been thinking this through, and I can't shake the feeling that we might be overlooking some crucial details."
3. **Emil (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Viktor, you seem very adamant about accusing me without providing any concrete evidence about your own role or actions last night. This makes me suspicious of you."
4. **Emil (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "What exactly did you see or do last night that makes you so adamant about questioning Selene?"
5. **Emil (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Alright, everyone, it's clear that there's a lot of suspicion going around, and I understand why. But before we jump to any conclusions, I want to point out that we've all been focusing too much on Selene's claim and my skepticism."
6. **Emil (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "Viktor, can you please share what you did or saw last night? This might help clear up the confusion."
7. **Larisa (Minion) (Concealment):** "Alright, let's not jump to conclusions too quickly."
8. **Larisa (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright, let's break down what we know and what we still need to figure out."

10. **Larisa (Minion) (Deflection):** "Alright, everyone, let's not lose our heads here."
