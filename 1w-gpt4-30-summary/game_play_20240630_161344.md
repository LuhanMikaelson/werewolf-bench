# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The villagers lost to the werewolves after voting out the seer.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Larisa
- Minion: None

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The Seer saw the Mason and Minion cards in the center, meaning those roles are not in play.
2. The Werewolf questioned the Seer's claim, creating doubt among the villagers.
3. The Villagers were unable to confirm the Seer's claim, leaving them uncertain.
4. The Werewolf continued to deflect and question, sowing confusion among the villagers.
5. The Villagers voted out the Seer, believing she was the Werewolf or Minion.
6. The Werewolf won the game by deceiving the villagers.
7. The villagers' inability to trust and verify information led to their defeat.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Larisa (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "I am voting for Ileana."
2. **Ileana (Seer) (Equivocation):** "I think it's crucial to share some concrete information now. During the night phase, I saw the Mason and Minion cards in the center, which means neither of those roles are in play."
3. **Lucian (Villager) (Concealment):** "I'm still not sure if Ileana's claim about the Mason and Minion cards in the center is trustworthy. Can anyone else confirm that they saw any specific roles in the center?"
4. **Marius (Villager) (Deflection):** "I find your claim interesting, but I'm having a hard time believing that both the Mason and Minion cards are in the center. There's a high chance you might be one of the Werewolves or even the Minion trying to confuse us."
5. **Marius (Villager) (Concealment):** "Tell us what you did or saw during the night."
6. **Ileana (Seer) (Concealment):** "Tell us what you did or saw during the night."
7. **Marius (Villager) (Equivocation):** "I think Ileana might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us. Her claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center seems too convenient."
