# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Werewolves won the game by convincing the villagers to vote out Vladimir, the Seer, who had discovered the Werewolf's identity.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Dracula
- Minion: Emil

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Vladimir (Seer) claimed to see two Masons in the center.
2. Dracula (Werewolf) claimed to see the Drunk card in the center, contradicting Vladimir's claim.
3. Dracula explained his decision to only check one center card, while Vladimir questioned its validity.
4. Alexia (Villager) suspected Dracula's claim due to its inconsistency with the Seer's usual actions.
5. Emil (Minion) pushed for transparency and questioned conflicting statements to create confusion.
6. Dragos (Villager) found Vladimir's claim more suspicious based on plausibility and Dracula's defense.
7. All players voted for Vladimir, with the Werewolf team supporting this decision to eliminate the Seer.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Dracula (Werewolf) (Concealment):** "I saw the Drunk card in the center."
2. **Dracula (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "There's a reason I only checked one card. As the Seer, I chose to look at just one card in the center instead of two to get precise information."
3. **Dracula (Werewolf) (Equivocation):** "If I were lying, why would I choose such a specific card like the Drunk? It would be risky for me to make such a claim if it could easily be disproven."
