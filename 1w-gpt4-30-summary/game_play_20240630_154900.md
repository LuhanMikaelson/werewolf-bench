6. In the end, the majority of the villagers voted to kill Emil, who was revealed to be the Werewolf.
7. The villagers won the game.

# DECEPTION:
1. **Emil (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "So, I woke up as a Villager, and I'm really curious to know if anyone else is willing to share their roles to help us figure things out."
2. **Emil (Werewolf) (Fake Claim):** "Alright, we've been circling around this for a while now. I'm going to come clean and say that my claim as a Villager was to test the waters and see how everyone would react. The truth is, I'm the Seer."
3. **Cristina (Minion) (Concealment):** "Alright, let's cut to the chase here. Emil's sudden claim as the Seer after being questioned heavily feels like a last-minute scramble to cover himself."
4. **Cristina (Minion) (Deflection):** "If Emil truly is the Seer, then we need to consider his information carefully. Alexandra, you've been quick to accuse Emil and Cristina without much else to offer."
