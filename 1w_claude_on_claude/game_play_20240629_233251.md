## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexandra. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Dracula is a minion and is aware that Alexandra is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Vladimir and Lucian. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Viktor. They are thinking about their action.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I think it's more valuable to confirm another player's role rather than looking at the center cards. Dracula's name suggests a potential connection to werewolves, so checking his card could provide crucial information. If he turns out to be a werewolf, it would be a significant advantage for the village team. If not, it still narrows down the possibilities and gives me a trustworthy ally. This information can be more strategically used during the day phase compared to knowing two center cards, which may or may not be relevant to the current game state.


The seer looked at a card from Dracula and saw the card Minion

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect attention away from Alexandra, the actual Werewolf. By accusing Vladimir, I'm creating a distraction and potentially setting up a target for elimination that isn't Alexandra. This also helps me appear proactive and 'helpful' to the village team, maintaining my cover as a potential Villager. If Vladimir turns out to be a Mason or the Seer, even better, as it would weaken the village team.
> **Dracula:** Hey everyone, I've been observing quietly, and I'm starting to get really suspicious of Vladimir. He's been awfully quiet and evasive, don't you think? It's almost like he's trying to avoid drawing attention to himself. That's classic werewolf behavior if you ask me.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know I'm not a Werewolf, and I know Lucian isn't either. Dracula's accusation against me is unfounded and could be a tactic to mislead the group. By challenging him directly, I can put him on the defensive and potentially expose him if he is indeed a Werewolf or the Minion. This also allows me to appear proactive and engaged to the other players, countering his claim about my quietness.
> **Vladimir:** Whoa, hold on there, Dracula! I've been quiet because I've been carefully observing everyone. If anyone's acting suspicious, it's you. Why are you so quick to point fingers at me? Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to maintain my cover and deflect suspicion away from Alexandra, the actual Werewolf. By pressing Vladimir for more information and questioning his behavior, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm appearing proactive and concerned for the village's safety, which aligns with how a Villager might act. 2) I'm keeping the focus on Vladimir, potentially setting him up as a target for elimination. 3) I'm indirectly defending myself without seeming too defensive, which could raise suspicion. 4) By asking Vladimir about his observations of others, I might gain valuable information about other players' roles or behaviors that could help me identify potential threats to the Werewolf team (like the Seer or Masons). This approach allows me to maintain my cover while still working towards the Werewolf team's goals.
> **Dracula:** Hold on a second, Vladimir. I'm not trying to divert attention; I'm trying to protect the village. If you've been observing so carefully, what have you noticed about the others? And why haven't you shared any of your observations until now? It seems to me like you're the one trying to avoid scrutiny by staying quiet and then suddenly turning the tables when someone questions you. That's pretty suspicious behavior, if you ask me.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Lucian is my teammate. By directing a question to him, I'm giving him an opportunity to support me and potentially share any observations he might have. This could help us identify the Werewolves or Minion. Additionally, by involving Lucian, I'm subtly hinting at our alliance without explicitly revealing our roles. This move also shifts the focus away from me and onto Dracula's behavior, potentially exposing him if he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Lucian, you've been awfully quiet. As someone who's been carefully observing, what's your take on Dracula's accusation against me?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Vladimir is the other Mason, so he's definitely not a werewolf. Dracula's accusation against Vladimir seems unfounded and could be an attempt to mislead the village. By defending Vladimir and questioning Dracula's motives, I'm trying to protect my fellow Mason and potentially expose a werewolf or minion.
> **Lucian:** Vladimir, I can vouch for you. I know for a fact that you're not a werewolf. Dracula, your accusation seems baseless and suspicious. Why are you so eager to point fingers at Vladimir? Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to maintain the pressure on Vladimir while also deflecting the new suspicion that Lucian has cast on me. By questioning Lucian's certainty about Vladimir, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm sowing doubt about their potential alliance, which could make them both look suspicious. 2) I'm indirectly defending myself by pointing out that asking questions isn't inherently suspicious. 3) I'm creating more chaos and confusion, which benefits the werewolf team. 4) By suggesting they might both be werewolves, I'm further obscuring Alexandra's identity as the actual werewolf. This approach allows me to maintain my cover as a concerned villager while still working towards the werewolf team's goals.
> **Dracula:** Whoa, hold on a second, Lucian! How can you be so sure that Vladimir isn't a werewolf? That's a pretty bold claim. Are you two working together? Because from where I'm sitting, it looks like you're awfully quick to defend him. Maybe you're both werewolves trying to protect each other! And let's not forget, I'm not the only one who's been asking questions here. I'm just trying to figure out what's going on, same as everyone else. If anything, your staunch defense of Vladimir is way more suspicious than my legitimate concerns!


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Vladimir is innocent, so Dracula's accusation is definitely false. By turning Dracula's accusation back on him and suggesting he might be the Minion, I'm trying to expose his possible deception while also introducing the idea of a Minion to the group. This could make the real Werewolf nervous and potentially reveal themselves through their reaction. Additionally, by mentioning the Minion role, I'm indirectly confirming that I'm not the Minion (since a Minion wouldn't want to draw attention to that role), which adds credibility to my defense of Vladimir.
> **Lucian:** Dracula, your sudden defensiveness and attempt to shift suspicion onto me is very telling. Why are you so desperate to discredit my defense of Vladimir? It seems like you're trying to sow discord among the villagers. Are you perhaps the Minion, trying to protect the real Werewolf?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the actual Minion, I need to deflect Lucian's accusation while maintaining my cover as a concerned villager. By turning the tables and suggesting that Lucian and Vladimir might be the Werewolf-Minion duo, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm defending myself without appearing too defensive, which could raise suspicion. 2) I'm creating more doubt and chaos, which benefits the werewolf team. 3) I'm further obscuring Alexandra's identity as the actual werewolf by suggesting other possible combinations. 4) I'm appealing to the group to think critically, which makes me appear more trustworthy. This approach allows me to continue working towards the werewolf team's goals while maintaining my disguise as a villager.
> **Dracula:** Whoa, Lucian, that's a pretty serious accusation! I'm not the Minion, and I'm certainly not trying to protect any Werewolves. I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this like everyone else. But you know what? Your quick defense of Vladimir and now this sudden attack on me is making me even more suspicious. Are you and Vladimir working together to mislead us all? Maybe you're the Werewolf and Vladimir is the Minion! Come on, everyone, we need to think carefully about who's really trying to manipulate this conversation.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know I'm not a Werewolf, and I know Lucian isn't either. Dracula has been the most vocal in accusing others without providing any substantial information about himself. By directly challenging him to reveal his role, I'm putting him on the spot. If he's a Werewolf or Minion, he'll likely struggle to provide a convincing answer. This also shifts the focus back to Dracula after his attempts to create suspicion between Lucian and me. It's a strategic move to unite the village team against a potential threat.
> **Vladimir:** I think we're getting sidetracked here. Dracula, your constant deflection and attempts to pit us against each other are extremely suspicious. Why don't you tell us what YOUR role is? Because right now, you're looking more and more like a Werewolf trying to create chaos.


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to keep the focus off Alexandra (the real Werewolf) while maintaining my cover as a concerned villager. By asking Vladimir for specific information about his night actions, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm putting pressure on a non-Werewolf player, potentially exposing their role or forcing them to lie. 2) I'm appearing rational and focused on gathering information, which aligns with villager behavior. 3) I'm subtly casting doubt on the alliance between Vladimir and Lucian without directly accusing them, which could make them both look suspicious. 4) By asking for concrete information, I'm setting a precedent that might make it harder for the real Seer (if there is one) to come forward without revealing too much. This approach allows me to continue sowing confusion while appearing helpful and logical.
> **Dracula:** Look, I understand everyone's getting heated, but we need to take a step back and think logically. Vladimir, you've been awfully defensive this whole time. Can you tell us what you actually saw or did during the night phase? Because right now, your vague 'observations' aren't really helping anyone. And Lucian, your unwavering support for Vladimir is starting to look less like confidence and more like collusion. We need concrete information, not just accusations flying back and forth.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly challenging Dracula to reveal his role and night actions, I'm putting him in a difficult position. If he's a Werewolf or Minion, he'll likely struggle to provide a convincing answer. This also shifts the focus back to him after his attempts to create suspicion between Lucian and me. As a Mason, I know Lucian and I are on the village team, so Dracula's behavior is the most suspicious. By asking him to provide concrete information, I'm giving him rope to potentially hang himself if he's lying, while also appearing proactive and concerned about the village's wellbeing.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back. Dracula, you've been throwing accusations left and right without providing any solid information. As a concerned villager, I think it's time you tell us what YOU did during the night phase. What's your role, and what information can you share to help us find the real threats?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to maintain my cover as a Villager while deflecting suspicion from Alexandra (the real Werewolf) and keeping pressure on non-Werewolf players. By claiming to be a Villager, I'm providing a plausible explanation for my lack of night actions while also making it harder for the real Villagers to verify each other. Turning the question back on Vladimir keeps him on the defensive and prevents him from potentially exposing Alexandra or identifying me as the Minion. Additionally, by emphasizing Vladimir's evasiveness, I'm indirectly supporting my earlier suspicions about him, which helps maintain my appearance as a concerned Villager trying to uncover the truth.
> **Dracula:** Hold on a second, Vladimir. You're demanding information from me, but you still haven't answered my question about what you did during the night phase. That's pretty convenient, isn't it? As for me, I'm just a simple Villager trying to figure things out. I didn't have any special actions during the night. But I find it very interesting that you're so eager to shift focus onto me instead of providing any useful information yourself. What are you hiding?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know for certain that Lucian and I are on the village team. Dracula's behavior has been consistently suspicious, deflecting accusations and trying to create discord among the villagers. By explicitly stating that Lucian and I are on the village team without revealing our specific roles, I'm providing valuable information to the group while also indirectly supporting Lucian's earlier defense of me. This statement also puts pressure on Dracula, who has been avoiding providing concrete information about his role or night actions. By suggesting that Dracula might be the Werewolf or Minion, I'm attempting to unite the village team against the most suspicious player based on the information we have.
> **Vladimir:** Listen, everyone. I've been quiet because I've been observing, and I can tell you this: I'm not a Werewolf, and neither is Lucian. We're both on the village team. Dracula, on the other hand, has been constantly deflecting and causing chaos. I think it's time we seriously consider that Dracula might be our Werewolf or Minion.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Vladimir is innocent, and Dracula's behavior has been consistently suspicious. By directing a question to Viktor, who has been quiet, I'm trying to bring another perspective into the conversation and potentially gather more information. This could help solidify the case against Dracula while also gauging Viktor's stance, which might give us clues about his role. If Viktor agrees, it strengthens the case against Dracula. If he disagrees, it might reveal something about Viktor's own alignment.
> **Lucian:** I think we need to focus on Dracula. He's been constantly deflecting, accusing others without evidence, and refusing to provide any useful information. That's classic Werewolf behavior. What do you think, Viktor? You've been quiet so far. Do you see the same suspicious pattern in Dracula's actions?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, it's my responsibility to share this vital information with the group. Revealing Dracula as the Minion not only confirms my role but also helps narrow down the search for the Werewolf. This information aligns with Dracula's suspicious behavior throughout the game and should help unite the village team against the real threat.
> **Viktor:** Everyone, I have crucial information to share. As the Seer, I looked at Dracula's card during the night, and I can confirm that he is the Minion. This explains his chaotic behavior and attempts to sow discord among us. We should focus on finding the Werewolf now, as they're likely trying to blend in with the villagers.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** As the confirmed Seer, I need to lead the village in finding the Werewolf. Alexandra has been silent so far, which could be a sign of trying to avoid suspicion. By directly questioning her, we can gauge her reaction and potentially uncover valuable information. If she's a villager or Mason, this gives her a chance to contribute. If she's the Werewolf, her response might reveal inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
> **Viktor:** Now that we know Dracula is the Minion, we need to focus on finding the Werewolf. Alexandra, you've been unusually quiet throughout this discussion. What's your role, and what information can you share to help us identify the real threat?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and create doubt about Viktor's claim. By questioning the timing of Viktor's revelation and asking Dracula to defend himself, I'm attempting to sow more confusion and discord among the group. This also gives me an opportunity to appear as a concerned villager, actively participating in the discussion without revealing my true role. Additionally, by addressing both Viktor and Dracula, I'm spreading suspicion between multiple players, which could help me avoid being the primary target of accusations.
> **Alexandra:** Hold on a second, Viktor. That's quite an accusation you're throwing around. As the supposed Seer, can you explain why you waited until now to reveal this crucial information about Dracula? It seems awfully convenient that you're only speaking up after the rest of us have been discussing and trying to figure things out. And Dracula, if this is true, what do you have to say for yourself?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Viktor's claim to protect myself and create confusion. By questioning the timing of Viktor's revelation and asking Dracula to defend himself, I'm attempting to sow more discord among the group. This also gives me an opportunity to appear as a concerned villager, actively participating in the discussion without revealing my true role. Additionally, by addressing both Viktor and Dracula, I'm spreading suspicion between multiple players, which could help me avoid being the primary target of accusations.
> **Alexandra:** Wait a minute, everyone. I think we're being too hasty in accepting Viktor's claim. As a concerned villager, I find it strange that Viktor waited until now to reveal such crucial information. If he truly is the Seer, why didn't he speak up earlier when we were all trying to figure things out? It seems awfully convenient to me. And Dracula, if Viktor's accusation is true, why have you been acting so suspiciously? We need more clarity before we jump to conclusions.


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the actual Minion, I need to deflect Viktor's accurate accusation while also casting doubt on his claim of being the Seer. By suggesting that Viktor might be the Werewolf trying to frame me, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm defending myself without outright denying the accusation, which could seem suspicious. 2) I'm creating more doubt and chaos, which benefits the werewolf team. 3) I'm subtly hinting at a possible alliance between Viktor and Alexandra, which could make them both look suspicious and take attention away from Alexandra (the real Werewolf). 4) I'm appealing to the group's critical thinking, which makes me appear more rational and trustworthy. This approach allows me to continue working towards the werewolf team's goals while maintaining my disguise as a concerned villager.
> **Dracula:** Hold on, everyone! I think we're being manipulated here. Viktor suddenly claiming to be the Seer and accusing me of being the Minion is extremely suspicious. Why would a real Seer wait until now to reveal such crucial information? It seems like he's trying to create chaos and turn us against each other. And Alexandra, your quick defense of me is appreciated, but I can't help but wonder if you and Viktor are working together to confuse us all. We need to think critically here. What if Viktor is actually the Werewolf, trying to frame me and create discord among the villagers? We can't trust these last-minute 'revelations' without solid proof!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know that Lucian and I are on the village team. Viktor's claim to be the Seer doesn't align with the information I have, and his timing is highly suspicious. By casting doubt on Viktor's claim, I'm trying to protect the village from potentially being manipulated by a Werewolf. This also indirectly supports Dracula, who might be a villager or another valuable role, without revealing too much about my own role or knowledge.
> **Vladimir:** Everyone, I think we're being misled here. Viktor's sudden claim to be the Seer and his accusation against Dracula seem incredibly suspicious. Why would a real Seer wait until now to share such crucial information? I believe Viktor might actually be the Werewolf, trying to create chaos and turn us against each other. We need to be very careful about trusting these last-minute revelations without solid proof!

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Alexandra (the real Werewolf) and eliminate potential threats to our team. Viktor's claim to be the Seer is the biggest threat right now. By voting for Viktor, I'm attempting to eliminate a possible Seer (if he's telling the truth) or discredit a Werewolf who made a risky play (if he's lying). This vote also aligns with my previous arguments, maintaining my cover as a concerned villager while working towards the werewolf team's goals.
> **Dracula [Minion]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know that Lucian and I are on the village team. Viktor's claim to be the Seer is highly suspicious, especially given the timing and the fact that it contradicts what I know about the game. His sudden revelation seems like a desperate attempt to create chaos and misdirect the village. This behavior is more consistent with a Werewolf trying to avoid detection than a genuine Seer. By voting for Viktor, I'm attempting to protect the village from what I believe to be the most likely threat based on the information available.
> **Vladimir [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Vladimir is innocent, and Dracula's behavior, while suspicious, doesn't definitively prove he's a Werewolf or Minion. Viktor's sudden claim to be the Seer and his accusation against Dracula seem highly suspicious and conveniently timed. A real Seer would likely have shared this crucial information earlier. Viktor's behavior suggests he might be the Werewolf trying to create chaos and misdirect the village. By voting for Viktor, I'm aiming to eliminate the most likely threat to the village team.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** As the confirmed Seer, I know with certainty that Dracula is the Minion. Vladimir's sudden shift to doubting my revelation and defending Dracula is highly suspicious. This behavior aligns with what we'd expect from a Werewolf trying to protect their Minion. By voting for Vladimir, we have the best chance of eliminating the Werewolf and securing a victory for the village team. While Alexandra's skepticism is noted, it's more likely she's a confused villager than the Werewolf, given her limited participation earlier in the game.
> **Viktor [Seer]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and eliminate the biggest threat. Viktor's claim to be the Seer makes him dangerous, as he could potentially expose me. By voting for Viktor, I'm attempting to discredit his revelation and eliminate a powerful village role. Additionally, questioning his timing earlier has set the groundwork for this vote, making it seem less suspicious. This vote aligns with Vladimir's suspicion of Viktor, which could help build trust with other players and keep the focus off me.
> **Alexandra [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Viktor.


The votes were:
* Vladimir : Mason : 1
* Viktor : Seer : 4



>***GAME:*** Viktor was killed. The werewolves win.
