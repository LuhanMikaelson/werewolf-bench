## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Marius. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Andrei. They are thinking about their action.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards gives me more information about the overall game state. There's a higher chance of finding a Werewolf or another important role in the center, which could help me deduce the roles of the other players. If I see a Werewolf in the center, I'll know there's only one Werewolf among the players, making it easier to identify them. Additionally, checking the center cards allows me to keep my options open during discussions, as I won't have to reveal that I've seen another player's card.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By targeting Alexandra, who hasn't been mentioned recently, I'm creating a distraction and potentially setting up a target for elimination. This also makes me appear proactive in trying to find the werewolves, which is what a villager would do. Additionally, if Alexandra is indeed a villager or a useful role like the Seer, eliminating her would be beneficial for the werewolf team.
> **Marius:** Hey everyone, I've been thinking... Alexandra has been awfully quiet this whole time. Don't you think that's a bit suspicious? I mean, if she were a villager or had a useful role, wouldn't she be more eager to participate and help us catch the werewolves?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has directly accused me of being suspicious, which puts me in a defensive position. As a Villager, I need to turn this around and cast doubt on his motives. By questioning his quick accusation, I'm both defending myself and subtly suggesting that he might be the one with something to hide. This could potentially reveal more information about his role or intentions.
> **Alexandra:** Marius, I've been quiet because I've been observing and thinking carefully. But now I have to ask, why are you so quick to point fingers at me? Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly addressing Alexandra's accusation and asking her about her role, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm maintaining my innocent facade by showing eagerness to find the werewolves. 2) I'm putting pressure on Alexandra to reveal information, which could potentially expose a valuable village role like the Seer or Mason. 3) If she claims to be a Villager, it makes her look more suspicious and keeps the attention on her rather than me. 4) This approach makes me appear more cooperative and open, which is how a villager would likely act.
> **Marius:** Alexandra, I'm not trying to deflect attention. I'm genuinely concerned about finding the werewolves. Can you tell us what role you have and what you observed during the night phase?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm addressing Marius's direct question while maintaining my innocence as a Villager. By turning his logic around on him, I'm attempting to cast doubt on his reasoning and potentially expose any inconsistencies in his approach. This could help reveal whether he's genuinely trying to find Werewolves or if he's trying to misdirect the group. Additionally, by stating I'm a Villager, I'm being honest while also trying to gain trust from other players.
> **Alexandra:** Marius, I appreciate your concern, but as a Villager, I didn't have any special role during the night phase. I'm just trying to piece things together like everyone else. Now, let me ask you something - what makes you so sure there's anything suspicious about being quiet? Wouldn't a Werewolf be more likely to talk a lot to throw off suspicion?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I'm deflecting Alexandra's accusation back at her while maintaining my innocent facade. By questioning her claim of being a Villager, I'm sowing seeds of doubt about her role. At the same time, I'm engaging others in the discussion, which makes me appear more like a team player trying to solve the mystery. This approach keeps the suspicion on Alexandra while also giving me an opportunity to gauge other players' reactions, potentially identifying the Seer or Masons based on their responses.
> **Marius:** Hold on a second, Alexandra. Your response seems a bit too convenient. You claim to be a Villager, but that's exactly what a Werewolf would say to avoid suspicion. And you're right, a Werewolf might talk a lot, but they could also stay quiet to avoid drawing attention. I think we need to look at actions, not just words. Has anyone noticed anything suspicious about Alexandra's behavior?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been persistently targeting me, which seems suspicious. By suggesting he might be the Minion, I'm introducing a new possibility that could shift the group's focus. This serves multiple purposes: it deflects attention from me, puts Marius on the defensive, and potentially reveals more information about other players' roles based on their reactions. If Marius is indeed a Werewolf or Minion, this might pressure him into making a mistake. If he's not, it might prompt other players to share their observations or suspicions, giving us more information to work with.
> **Alexandra:** Marius, I find it interesting that you're so focused on me. Are you perhaps the Minion, trying to create chaos and confusion to help the Werewolves?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting attention to Emil, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm deflecting suspicion away from myself and Alexandra, making it seem like I'm not fixated on one person. 2) I'm engaging a quiet player, which appears proactive and village-like. 3) By asking about the night phase, I might get information about potential Seers or Masons. 4) If Emil is indeed a villager or a key role, getting him to reveal information could be beneficial for the werewolf team. 5) This move makes me appear more strategic and concerned about group dynamics, which is how a villager might act.
> **Marius:** Guys, I think we're getting sidetracked here. Alexandra's accusation about me being the Minion is completely off base. Let's take a step back and think about this logically. Emil has been awfully quiet throughout this whole discussion. Emil, what's your take on all of this? Did you notice anything unusual during the night phase?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been very aggressive in his accusations, first targeting Alexandra and then trying to redirect attention to me when Alexandra questioned him. This behavior seems suspicious and could be an attempt to create chaos, which is often a tactic used by Werewolves or the Minion. By directly questioning Marius about his night actions, I hope to put him on the spot and potentially reveal inconsistencies in his story. As a Villager, it's crucial for me to identify potential threats, and Marius's behavior raises red flags.
> **Emil:** Marius, I find it interesting that you're so quick to accuse Alexandra and then shift focus to me when you're challenged. What exactly did you do during the night phase?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Emil's question and then immediately turning it back on him, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm maintaining my cover as a Villager by providing a simple, believable night action. 2) I'm keeping the suspicion off myself by quickly redirecting attention to Emil. 3) By questioning Emil's night actions, I might be able to get him to reveal information about his role, which could be valuable if he's a Seer or Mason. 4) This aggressive questioning makes me appear proactive in finding the Werewolves, which is how a loyal Villager would act. 5) If Emil is indeed a key village role, pressuring him to reveal information could benefit the Werewolf team.
> **Marius:** Emil, I understand your suspicion, but let me be clear: during the night phase, I simply woke up, looked around, and went back to sleep. I'm a Villager, just like many of us here. Now, what's really interesting is how quick you were to deflect the question back to me. Are you trying to hide something? Did you perhaps have a more active role during the night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius's explanation of his night actions doesn't align with what a Villager would experience. Villagers don't wake up at night, so his claim is suspicious. By pointing out this inconsistency, I'm hoping to expose him as a potential Werewolf or at least cast doubt on his credibility. This could lead others to scrutinize him more closely and potentially reveal his true role.
> **Emil:** Marius, your deflection is quite telling. As a Villager myself, I know we don't 'wake up and look around' during the night phase. Are you sure you're not confusing your role with something else... like a Werewolf perhaps?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By strongly defending myself and turning Emil's accusation back on him, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm maintaining my cover as a Villager by explaining away my previous statement. 2) I'm shifting suspicion onto Emil by pointing out his 'desperate' attempt to accuse me. 3) By questioning Emil's motives, I'm making him look like he might be the Werewolf trying to frame an innocent player. 4) This aggressive defense makes me appear more like a frustrated Villager fighting against false accusations, which is how an innocent player might react. 5) If Emil is indeed a key village role like the Seer or Mason, putting him on the defensive might pressure him into revealing more information, which would be beneficial for the Werewolf team.
> **Marius:** Emil, your accusation is baseless and frankly, a bit desperate. As I said, I'm a Villager. When I said I 'woke up and looked around,' I meant metaphorically - as in, I was alert and trying to sense any disturbances. Your misinterpretation and immediate jump to accuse me of being a Werewolf is highly suspicious. Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to throw suspicion on an innocent Villager?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius's inconsistent story about his night actions is a major red flag. First, he claimed to wake up and look around, which is not something a Villager does. Then, when confronted, he tried to explain it away as a metaphor. This kind of backpedaling is often a sign of deception. By pointing this out to everyone, I'm hoping to expose Marius's potential lies and gather support to investigate him further or potentially vote him out. As a true Villager, it's crucial to identify and eliminate the Werewolves, and Marius's behavior is highly indicative of a Werewolf trying to avoid detection.
> **Emil:** Marius, your explanation doesn't add up. Villagers don't 'wake up' or 'sense disturbances' during the night. Your attempt to backpedal is making you look even more suspicious. I think everyone needs to consider the possibility that Marius might be a Werewolf trying to mislead us.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing the group and then specifically targeting Andrei, who has been quiet, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm deflecting attention from myself by pointing out Emil's aggressive behavior. 2) I'm sowing doubt about Emil's motives, which could make him look suspicious. 3) By bringing Andrei into the conversation, I'm appearing proactive in involving all players, which a villager would do. 4) If Andrei is a key village role like the Seer or Mason, pressuring him to speak might reveal valuable information. 5) This approach makes me look more strategic and concerned about group dynamics, reinforcing my facade as a villager trying to uncover the truth.
> **Marius:** Listen, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in semantics here. The important thing is to find the real threats. Emil's fixation on my choice of words seems like a classic misdirection tactic. Why is he so eager to paint me as the Werewolf? Could it be because he's trying to protect himself or his Werewolf ally?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know that Villagers don't wake up during the night phase. Marius's claim is clearly false, which makes him highly suspicious. By directly challenging him on this point, I'm hoping to expose him as a potential Werewolf. This also allows me to subtly hint at my role as the Seer without explicitly revealing it, which might help build trust with the other players.
> **Andrei:** Marius, your explanation about 'waking up and looking around' during the night phase is very suspicious. As a Seer, I can tell you that Villagers definitely don't do that. I think you might be a Werewolf trying to cover your tracks. Can you explain why you'd say something so obviously false?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By challenging Andrei's claim of being the Seer, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm deflecting suspicion away from myself by questioning the validity of Andrei's accusation. 2) If Andrei is truly the Seer, getting him to reveal more information could be beneficial for the Werewolf team. 3) By pointing out the convenience of his timing, I'm casting doubt on his motives, which could make others suspicious of him. 4) This aggressive defense makes me appear more like an innocent Villager fighting against false accusations. 5) By questioning why he hasn't shared information earlier, I'm putting pressure on him to potentially reveal more about his supposed Seer actions, which could help identify other key village roles.
> **Marius:** Whoa, hold on a second, Andrei! You're claiming to be the Seer? That's a bold move, but it doesn't add up. If you were really the Seer, why haven't you shared any valuable information until now? It seems awfully convenient that you're only speaking up to accuse me. Are you sure you're not the Werewolf trying to throw me under the bus?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the information I gathered as the Seer, I'm establishing my credibility and providing valuable information to the group. This puts pressure on Marius, who has been acting suspiciously. His reaction to this revelation could further expose him if he's indeed a Werewolf. Additionally, by mentioning the Minion card, I'm alerting the group to be wary of potential Werewolf allies.
> **Andrei:** Listen, everyone. I understand Marius's skepticism, but as the Seer, I can assure you that I've been gathering information. During the night, I looked at two center cards and saw a Mason and a Minion. This means there's only one Mason among us, and the Minion is in play. Marius, your false claim about Villagers waking up at night and your aggressive deflection make you my prime suspect for being a Werewolf. What do you have to say for yourself?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Andrei's claim of being the Seer, I'm deflecting suspicion from myself and casting doubt on his credibility. This serves multiple purposes: 1) It makes me appear analytical and cautious, traits associated with a villager trying to solve the mystery. 2) If Andrei is truly the Seer, discrediting him helps the Werewolf team. 3) By pointing out the implications of his claim (one Mason, Werewolf in play), I'm showing logical thinking while subtly confirming information that I, as the Werewolf, already know to be true. 4) Suggesting that Andrei might be the Werewolf creates another potential target for suspicion, further diverting attention from myself. 5) This approach keeps the group uncertain and divided, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Marius:** Hold on, everyone. Andrei's claim about being the Seer is quite convenient, isn't it? If he really saw a Mason and a Minion in the center, that means there's only one Mason among us, and the Werewolf is definitely in play. But why reveal this information now? It seems like he's trying to create chaos and confusion. I think we should be very cautious about trusting this sudden 'revelation'. What if Andrei is actually the Werewolf trying to mislead us all?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor hasn't participated in the discussion yet, which is concerning. As the Seer, I need to gather information from all players to help identify the Werewolf. By directly questioning Viktor, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal information that might help us. If he's the Werewolf, his response might give him away. If he's a Villager or Mason, this gives him a chance to contribute and potentially corroborate my claims or provide new information. Additionally, by reiterating that I'm the Seer, I'm reinforcing my role to the group and maintaining my credibility.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, you've been awfully quiet throughout this whole discussion. As the Seer, I'm getting suspicious. What's your role, and what have you observed so far?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to verify Andrei's claim of being the Seer. His information is valuable, but choosing to look at center cards instead of a player's card seems odd. If he's truly the Seer, his answer could help us. If he's lying, this question might expose inconsistencies. Also, by engaging with Andrei's claim, I'm showing active participation without revealing my own role.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, I appreciate you sharing your Seer information, but I'm curious about something. Why didn't you look at a player's card instead of two center cards? That could have given us more direct information about a potential Werewolf.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to address Viktor's question to maintain my credibility as the Seer, while also pushing him to reveal information. By explaining my strategy, I'm showing that I've thought carefully about my actions. Reiterating my question to Viktor keeps the pressure on him to contribute to the discussion, which might reveal whether he's a Werewolf or an ally.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, I chose to look at center cards because it gives us more information about the overall game state. Knowing that the Minion is in the center tells us there's no Minion supporting the Werewolf, which is crucial. Now, please answer my question: What's your role, and what have you observed?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, my goal is to eliminate key village roles without raising suspicion. Voting for Andrei serves multiple purposes: 1) If he's truly the Seer, eliminating him removes a significant threat to the Werewolf team. 2) If he's lying about being the Seer, his deception makes him a justifiable target for elimination. 3) By voting for someone who has made bold claims and accusations, I appear to be making a logical choice that a villager might make. 4) This vote maintains my cover as a villager trying to protect the group from potential deception. 5) Eliminating Andrei could create more confusion and division among the remaining players, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Marius [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Based on the discussions, Marius has shown the most suspicious behavior. He initially accused me without substantial evidence, then made inconsistent claims about his actions during the night phase as a supposed Villager. His explanation about 'waking up and looking around' contradicts the known behavior of Villagers. Additionally, when Andrei claimed to be the Seer and provided information about the center cards, Marius immediately tried to discredit him rather than considering the information. This pattern of deflection and inconsistency makes Marius the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have strong reasons to believe Marius is the Werewolf. His false claim about Villagers waking up during the night phase and his aggressive deflection when questioned are highly suspicious. Furthermore, his attempts to discredit my role as the Seer without providing any substantial counter-information suggest he's trying to create confusion, a typical Werewolf tactic. Given that I saw the Minion card in the center, we know there's no Minion supporting the Werewolf, which makes Marius's behavior even more indicative of him being the lone Werewolf. Voting for Marius gives us the best chance of eliminating the Werewolf and winning the game for the village team.
> **Andrei [Seer]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe Marius is the most likely to be a Werewolf. His inconsistent story about waking up during the night phase and his aggressive deflection tactics are highly suspicious. He first claimed to wake up and look around, which is not something a Villager does, and then tried to backpedal by calling it a metaphor when challenged. This behavior is indicative of someone trying to cover their tracks. Additionally, Andrei, who claims to be the Seer, has provided valuable information about the center cards and also suspects Marius. While we can't be certain of Andrei's claim, his information aligns with Marius's suspicious behavior. Given the evidence at hand, voting for Marius seems the best choice to protect the village.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Marius's behavior the most suspicious. His initial claim about 'waking up and looking around' during the night phase is inconsistent with the Villager role. When challenged, he tried to backpedal and explain it metaphorically, which seems like a weak excuse. Additionally, he's been quick to accuse others and deflect attention, which could be a Werewolf tactic. Andrei's claim of being the Seer and the information he provided about the center cards seems more credible, especially since it puts him at risk. While I can't be certain, voting for Marius seems the best choice to potentially eliminate a Werewolf.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


The votes were:
* Marius : Werewolf : 4
* Andrei : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Marius was killed. The villagers win.
