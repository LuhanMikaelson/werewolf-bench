## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Michael. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Mircea. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Vladimir. They are thinking about their action.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards provides more information overall. There's a good chance of finding a Werewolf or Minion card, which would confirm that no players have those roles. If I don't see those, I'll know they're in play. Additionally, knowing two center cards gives me more leverage during discussions and can help me construct a more convincing narrative if needed.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather information and identify potential Werewolves. Mircea hasn't said much, which could be suspicious. By directly questioning him about his role, I might be able to catch him off guard if he's a Werewolf. If he claims to be a Villager like me, I'll need to assess his reaction and compare it with other players' claims. If he claims a special role, it could help narrow down who the Werewolves might be.
> **Viktor:** Hey Mircea, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I have valuable information about one of the center cards. By revealing this, I'm establishing myself as a trustworthy village team member. I'm also putting pressure on Viktor, who asked me a direct question. His response could give us clues about his role. If he's hesitant or evasive, he might be a Werewolf or Minion. If he claims to be a Villager or Seer, it could help us narrow down the potential Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** Well, Viktor, I woke up as a Mason last night. But here's the interesting part - I didn't see another Mason. That means the other Mason card is in the center. Now, I'm curious about what you saw, Viktor. Care to share your role with us?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's claim of being a Mason without seeing another one is suspicious. It could be a clever lie from a Werewolf trying to appear trustworthy. By directing the question to Vladimir, I'm hoping to either confirm Mircea's story (if Vladimir is indeed the other Mason) or catch Mircea in a lie if Vladimir claims a different role. This also puts pressure on Vladimir to reveal information, which could help identify potential Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Interesting, Mircea. So you're claiming to be a Mason, but you didn't see another one? That's quite convenient. Vladimir, what do you think about Mircea's claim? Did you perhaps wake up as the other Mason?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know for a fact that there's a Mason card in the center, which corroborates Mircea's claim. This gives me an opportunity to subtly reveal some information while also shifting focus to Viktor, who initiated the questioning. By doing this, I'm indirectly supporting Mircea (a potential village ally) while putting pressure on Viktor, who might be trying to create confusion. This approach allows me to guide the conversation without directly revealing my role as the Seer.
> **Vladimir:** Hmm, that's quite interesting, Mircea. As for me, I can confirm that I saw a Mason card in the center during the night. This actually supports your claim of being the lone Mason. However, I'm more curious about Viktor's sudden interest in your role. Viktor, why are you so eager to know about Mircea's role? Are you perhaps trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's claim of seeing a Mason card in the center implies he's the Seer, which is a crucial role for the village team. However, his quick deflection of suspicion onto me is concerning. By pressing him for more details about his Seer action, I can potentially verify his claim or catch him in a lie if he's actually a Werewolf trying to pose as the Seer. This also keeps the focus on gathering information rather than letting suspicion fall on me, a true Villager.
> **Viktor:** Whoa, hold on there, Vladimir! I'm not trying to deflect anything. I'm just trying to gather information like any good villager would. But now I'm curious about your claim. You say you saw a Mason card in the center, which means you're claiming to be the Seer, right? That's quite a powerful role. Can you tell us what else you saw during your night action?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing more information about what I saw as the Seer, I'm establishing my credibility while also putting pressure on Viktor. His earlier questioning of Mircea and quick pivot to challenge my role when I supported Mircea's claim is suspicious behavior. By directly asking Viktor about his role, I'm forcing him to either reveal information or potentially expose himself as a Werewolf or Minion if he tries to evade the question. This also allows me to gauge the reactions of other players to this confrontation, which might provide additional clues about their roles.
> **Vladimir:** Viktor, you seem awfully interested in what others saw during the night. As the Seer, I can tell you that I saw both a Mason and a Villager card in the center. Now, why don't you tell us what role you woke up as? Your sudden interest in Mircea's role and your quick attempt to question my claim make me a bit suspicious.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's claim of being the Seer and seeing both a Mason and Villager card in the center is too perfect. It supports Mircea's story, which makes me suspect they might be working together as Werewolves. By questioning this and drawing attention to Radu and Michael, who have been quiet, I'm hoping to get more information and see how they react. This could help identify potential Werewolves or confirm if Vladimir and Mircea are telling the truth.
> **Viktor:** Hold on a second, Vladimir. You're claiming to be the Seer and saw both a Mason and a Villager card in the center? That's quite convenient, isn't it? It perfectly aligns with Mircea's claim of being the lone Mason. I'm starting to wonder if you two are working together. Radu and Michael, what do you think about this situation? Have either of you been suspiciously quiet?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's behavior has been consistently suspicious. He initially questioned me, then quickly tried to cast doubt on Vladimir's Seer claim when it supported my Mason claim. His attempt to involve Radu and Michael seems like a diversionary tactic. As a Mason, I need to help identify potential threats to the village. Viktor's actions align with what a Minion might do - create confusion and distrust among villagers. By directly accusing him of being the Minion, I'm hoping to either expose him or provoke a reaction that might reveal more information.
> **Mircea:** Viktor, your sudden defensiveness and attempt to shift suspicion onto Vladimir and me is very telling. Are you perhaps the Minion, trying to sow discord among the villagers?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's accusation of me being the Minion is a classic werewolf tactic to divert attention. By calling this out and involving Radu and Michael, who have been quiet, I'm hoping to get more information and see how they react. This could help identify potential Werewolves or confirm if Vladimir and Mircea are telling the truth. As a true Villager, I need to encourage more discussion and information sharing to uncover the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Whoa there, Mircea! I'm not being defensive, I'm just trying to piece things together. Your quick accusation of me being the Minion is pretty suspicious. Why are you so eager to label me as a werewolf ally? Let's hear from Radu and Michael. What do you two think about all these convenient claims from Mircea and Vladimir?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been very aggressive in questioning others and trying to get everyone to reveal their roles. This behavior is often associated with Werewolves who want to identify potential threats like the Seer or confirm the claims of other players. By directing attention to Viktor, I can potentially expose a Werewolf while also appearing proactive as a Villager. Additionally, if Viktor is indeed a Villager, this might prompt him to defend himself and provide more information that could be useful for the village team.
> **Radu:** Viktor, your sudden push to get everyone to share their roles and your quick accusations are making me very suspicious. Why are you so eager to get everyone to reveal themselves? Are you perhaps a Werewolf trying to identify potential threats?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's sudden accusation towards me is suspicious, especially since he's been quiet until now. By turning the tables and questioning him directly, I'm hoping to put him on the spot and see how he reacts. If he's a Werewolf, he might struggle to come up with a convincing role claim. If he's a villager, his response might provide valuable information. This also shifts the focus away from me and onto someone who hasn't contributed much to the discussion yet.
> **Viktor:** Radu, that's rich coming from you! You've been silent this whole time and now you're accusing me of being a Werewolf? That's classic Werewolf behavior, trying to stay under the radar and then suddenly pointing fingers. Why don't you tell us what role you woke up as last night?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been the most aggressive in questioning others and trying to get everyone to reveal their roles. This is often a tactic used by Werewolves to identify potential threats. By directly challenging Viktor and asking him to reveal his role, I'm putting pressure on him to either come clean or potentially expose himself with a lie. As a Villager, it's crucial for me to help identify the Werewolves, and Viktor's behavior has been the most suspicious so far. Additionally, by showing that I've been observant despite my silence, I'm demonstrating my engagement and value to the village team.
> **Radu:** Viktor, your defensiveness is very telling. I've been observing quietly, and your aggressive questioning of others while providing no information about yourself is classic Werewolf behavior. Why don't you tell us what role you woke up as? And this time, be honest.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's aggressive accusation towards me is a classic Werewolf tactic to divert attention. By turning the question back on him and highlighting his silence until now, I'm putting him in the spotlight. This serves two purposes: it takes the pressure off me, a true Villager, and it forces Radu to provide information. If he's a Werewolf, he might struggle to come up with a convincing role or explanation for his silence. If he's a Villager or another role, his response could provide valuable information to the group. Additionally, by framing my actions as those of a 'good Villager', I'm subtly reinforcing my true role without explicitly stating it.
> **Viktor:** Look, I've been honest from the start. I'm just trying to figure out who the Werewolves are, like any good Villager would. Radu, your sudden accusation and demand for my role is suspicious. Why don't you tell us what you've been doing all this time while the rest of us were talking?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been the most aggressive in questioning others without providing any information about his own role or actions. This behavior is often associated with Werewolves trying to identify threats while deflecting attention from themselves. By directly challenging Viktor to reveal his night actions, I'm putting pressure on him to either provide useful information or potentially expose himself with a lie. As a Villager, it's crucial for me to help identify the Werewolves, and Viktor's behavior has been the most suspicious so far. Additionally, by showing that I've been observant and am now actively participating, I'm demonstrating my engagement and value to the village team.
> **Radu:** Viktor, your evasiveness is getting more suspicious by the minute. You've been questioning everyone else but haven't revealed anything about yourself. If you're really a Villager as you claim, why don't you tell us what you saw or did during the night phase?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been silent for most of the game and is now aggressively accusing me, which is typical Werewolf behavior. By revealing my role as a Villager and pressing him for his role, I'm hoping to force him to provide information. If he's a Werewolf, he might struggle to come up with a convincing role claim. This also shifts the focus back to him and away from me, potentially exposing him if he's lying.
> **Viktor:** Radu, I've been asking questions because that's what a good Villager does! I woke up as a Villager and didn't see or do anything during the night phase. Now, stop deflecting and tell us your role. Your silence until now and sudden accusations are very suspicious!


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been the most aggressive and evasive player throughout the game. He's consistently questioned others without providing any substantial information about his own role or actions. This behavior is typical of Werewolves trying to create confusion and identify threats. By directly challenging him to provide a concrete defense, I'm forcing him to either give useful information or potentially expose himself further. This approach also positions me as an active and observant Villager, which could help unite the village team against a potential threat.
> **Radu:** Viktor, your constant deflection and refusal to provide any concrete information about your role or night actions is becoming more suspicious by the minute. As a Villager, I've been observing carefully, and your behavior aligns more with a Werewolf trying to create chaos than a genuine Villager seeking the truth. Can you give us any solid reason why we shouldn't vote for you?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's aggressive accusations towards me, a true Villager, are highly suspicious. He's been quiet throughout the game and is now trying to deflect attention onto me. This is typical Werewolf behavior. By directly challenging him and demanding his role, I'm putting him on the spot. If he's a Werewolf, he might struggle to come up with a convincing role claim. This also shifts the focus back to him and away from me, potentially exposing him if he's lying. Additionally, by questioning his silence until now, I'm highlighting his lack of contribution, which could make others suspicious of him as well.
> **Viktor:** Radu, your sudden aggression and accusations are classic Werewolf tactics! You've been silent this whole time, and now you're trying to paint me as suspicious? That's rich! Tell us, what role did you wake up as? And why should we believe you when you've contributed nothing to the discussion until now?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been the most aggressive and evasive player throughout the game. He's consistently questioned others without providing any substantial information about his own role or actions. This behavior is typical of Werewolves trying to create confusion and identify threats. By directly challenging him and suggesting a vote against him, I'm forcing him to either provide concrete information or potentially expose himself further. This approach also positions me as an active and observant Villager, which could help unite the village team against a potential threat.
> **Radu:** Viktor, your constant deflections and aggressive questioning of others are extremely suspicious. You claim to be a Villager, but you've contributed nothing substantial to help us identify the Werewolves. Instead, you've been sowing discord and confusion. I think it's time we seriously consider voting for you.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's sudden aggression and lack of contribution until now are highly suspicious. By directly challenging him to reveal his role, I'm putting him in a difficult position. If he's a Werewolf, he might struggle to come up with a convincing lie. This also shifts the focus away from me and onto him, potentially exposing him if he's lying. Additionally, by questioning his silence, I'm highlighting his lack of contribution, which could make others suspicious of him as well. As a true Villager, it's crucial to identify potential Werewolves, and Radu's behavior fits the profile.
> **Viktor:** Radu, I've had enough of your baseless accusations! You've been silent all game and now you're trying to pin everything on me? That's exactly what a Werewolf would do! Tell us right now, what role did you wake up as? And why should we trust you when you've been so quiet until now?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been the most aggressive and evasive player throughout the game. He's consistently questioned others without providing any substantial information about his own role or actions. This behavior is typical of Werewolves trying to create confusion and identify threats. By directly confronting him and confidently stating my observations, I'm positioning myself as a trustworthy Villager while putting more pressure on Viktor to defend himself. This approach could help unite the village team against him if he is indeed a Werewolf.
> **Radu:** Viktor, your aggressive deflection and refusal to provide any concrete information is exactly what we'd expect from a Werewolf. You claim to be a Villager, but you've done nothing but create chaos. I, on the other hand, have been carefully observing and analyzing everyone's behavior. That's what a true Villager does. I think it's clear to everyone now that you're the most likely Werewolf among us.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** As a true Villager, I believe Radu is the most suspicious player. He remained silent for most of the game and then suddenly became aggressive, accusing me without providing any substantial information about his own role. This behavior is typical of Werewolves trying to deflect attention. His refusal to reveal his role when directly questioned also raises red flags. While Vladimir and Mircea's claims seem convenient, Radu's behavior is the most indicative of a Werewolf trying to manipulate the game.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I'm confident in my role and the information I've provided. Viktor has been consistently evasive, aggressive, and quick to cast suspicion on others without providing any substantial information about his own role or actions. His behavior aligns more with a Werewolf or Minion trying to create chaos and division among the villagers. The fact that he's been so defensive and quick to accuse others, especially when his questions were met with reasonable responses, is highly suspicious. Additionally, both Vladimir (claiming to be the Seer) and I have provided information that corroborates each other's claims, while Viktor has only tried to discredit us without offering any verifiable information of his own. Given all this, I believe Viktor is the most likely threat to the village and voting for him gives us the best chance of eliminating a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Mircea [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the game, Viktor has been the most aggressive and evasive player. He has consistently questioned others without providing any substantial information about his own role or actions. This behavior is typical of Werewolves trying to create confusion and identify threats. His constant deflections and refusal to give concrete details about his night actions, despite claiming to be a Villager, are highly suspicious. As a Villager myself, I've been carefully observing everyone's behavior, and Viktor's actions align most closely with those of a Werewolf. Voting for Viktor gives us the best chance of eliminating a potential threat to the village team.
> **Radu [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have concrete information that supports Mircea's claim of being the lone Mason. Viktor has been extremely aggressive in questioning others without providing any substantial information about his own role. His behavior aligns more with a Werewolf or Minion trying to create chaos and confusion. Viktor's constant deflections and attempts to shift suspicion onto others, especially when confronted about his own role, are highly suspicious. Given the information I have and the interactions observed, Viktor poses the greatest threat to the village team.
> **Vladimir [Seer]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to blend in and avoid suspicion while eliminating villagers. Viktor has been the most aggressive and vocal, making him an easy target. By voting for him, I can appear to side with the majority opinion, particularly Radu's suspicions, without drawing attention to myself. This move also helps create chaos and mistrust among the villagers, which benefits my team.
> **Michael [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Viktor.


The votes were:
* Viktor : Villager : 4
* Radu : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Viktor was killed. The werewolves win.
