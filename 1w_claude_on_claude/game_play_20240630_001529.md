## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Michael. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Stefan and Dracula. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Radu. They are thinking about their action.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards provides more information overall. There's a good chance of finding a Werewolf or Minion card, which would immediately narrow down the potential threats. If I don't find these, I'll know they're more likely to be with the players. Additionally, knowing two center cards gives me more flexibility in crafting a strategy or bluffing during the day phase, as I can claim to be one of those roles if needed.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know that Dracula is the other Mason. By revealing this information, I'm establishing our credibility and narrowing down the pool of potential Werewolves. This could encourage the Seer or Villagers to speak up and share their information, while also putting pressure on the Werewolves and Minion to defend themselves.
> **Stefan:** Hey everyone, I've got some important information to share. Dracula and I are both Masons, so we can trust each other. That means we're looking for the Werewolves among the rest of you. Who's acting suspicious?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know there's a Minion card in the center, which contradicts Stefan's claim about him and Dracula both being Masons. This could mean either Stefan or Dracula is lying, possibly to cover for being a Werewolf. By asking Stefan for more details, I'm hoping to catch him in a lie or get more information that might reveal the truth. This also indirectly challenges Dracula without accusing him directly, allowing me to gauge both of their reactions.
> **Radu:** Interesting, Stefan. But I'm not sure we can trust that information. I saw the Minion card in the center, which means one of you might be lying about being a Mason. Can you tell us more about what you saw during the night phase?


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** Radu's claim directly contradicts what I know to be true. By challenging him and suggesting he might be the Minion, I'm attempting to discredit his statement and maintain the trust in my and Dracula's Mason status. This could also potentially reveal more information about Radu's true role, as his response might give clues to the other players.
> **Stefan:** Radu, that's a bold claim about seeing the Minion card in the center. Are you sure you're not trying to sow confusion? As a Mason, I can assure you that what I'm saying is true. Dracula and I are definitely the Masons. Maybe you're the Minion trying to create doubt?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** By directing the question to Dracula, I'm putting pressure on both Stefan and Dracula to corroborate their stories. If they're both lying, this might cause them to slip up or contradict each other. If Dracula is honest and Stefan is lying, this gives Dracula a chance to reveal the truth. Additionally, by pointing out Stefan's defensive behavior, I'm subtly suggesting to others that he might be hiding something, without directly accusing him of being a Werewolf yet.
> **Radu:** Stefan, your defensiveness is making me even more suspicious. If you're really a Mason, why are you so quick to accuse me of being the Minion? A true villager would be more interested in finding the real threat. Dracula, what's your take on this? Did you actually see Stefan as a Mason during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to back up Stefan's claim since we are both Masons. Radu's statement about seeing the Minion card in the center is likely a lie, as Masons don't have the ability to see center cards. By questioning Radu directly, I'm hoping to put pressure on him and see how he reacts. This could help us identify if he's the Werewolf or Minion trying to create confusion.
> **Dracula:** Yes, Stefan, I can confirm that we are indeed both Masons. I saw you during the night phase. Radu, your claim about seeing the Minion card in the center is very suspicious. Are you trying to mislead us?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** I'm maintaining my position as the Seer while putting pressure on both Stefan and Dracula. By directly questioning Dracula and pointing out the inconsistency between their claims and what I know to be true, I'm hoping to expose their potential alliance. This approach also invites other players to be more skeptical of Stefan and Dracula's claims, potentially leading to more scrutiny of their actions.
> **Radu:** Dracula, I find it hard to believe you're both telling the truth. I know for certain I saw the Minion card in the center, which means one of you is lying. Stefan's aggressive response and your quick agreement make me think you might be working together. Are you sure you're not covering for each other?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm directly confronting Radu because his claim about seeing the Minion card is impossible given that Stefan and I are both Masons. By putting pressure on him and questioning if he's the Werewolf, I'm hoping to either expose him or force him to reveal more information that might help us identify the real threat. This also reinforces my alliance with Stefan and our credibility as Masons.
> **Dracula:** Radu, your insistence on seeing the Minion card in the center is very troubling. As a Mason, I know for certain that Stefan and I are telling the truth. Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to create chaos and division among us?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan and Dracula are clearly working together, either as Werewolves or as actual Masons trying to mislead us. Michael hasn't said much either, but Emil's complete silence is more concerning. By directly questioning Emil, I'm hoping to get more information and potentially expose another Werewolf if he's working with Stefan and Dracula. This also shifts the focus away from me and onto another player, which might make the others less likely to suspect me of lying about being the Seer.
> **Radu:** Emil, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night? Your silence is making me suspicious.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather more information to identify the Werewolves. Radu's claim about seeing the Minion card contradicts Stefan and Dracula's Mason story. By asking Radu for more details, I can potentially catch him in a lie if he's a Werewolf, or get valuable information if he's telling the truth. This also puts pressure on Radu without directly accusing him, which could help reveal his true intentions.
> **Emil:** Radu, I find your claim about seeing the Minion card very interesting. Can you tell us more about what else you saw during the night phase?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil's attempt to get me to reveal more information without answering my question about his role is suspicious. By redirecting the focus back to him and expressing my suspicion, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal his role or potentially expose himself as a Werewolf. This also maintains my credibility as the Seer without giving away too much information that could be used against me later in the game. Additionally, this approach keeps the pressure on Emil, Stefan, and Dracula, who have all acted suspiciously so far.
> **Radu:** Emil, I appreciate your interest, but I'm not comfortable revealing more about what I saw as the Seer right now. It's crucial that we focus on finding the Werewolves. Your deflection and failure to answer my question about your role is very suspicious. Are you perhaps trying to hide something?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's behavior has been inconsistent. He first claimed to have seen the Minion card in the center, implying he might be the Seer. Now he's explicitly stating he's the Seer but doesn't want to reveal more. This contradiction is highly suspicious and could indicate he's a Werewolf trying to create confusion. By directly questioning this inconsistency, I'm hoping to either expose his lie or get a clear explanation that could help the village team. Additionally, by reaffirming my role as a Villager, I'm being transparent while still following the game rules of not explicitly revealing my role when answering questions.
> **Emil:** Radu, I find your sudden defensiveness quite suspicious. As a Villager, I'm trying to gather information to help us all. Your claim about being the Seer contradicts your earlier statement about seeing the Minion card. Which one is it? Are you the Seer or did you see the Minion card?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil's attempt to create confusion about my role is a classic Werewolf tactic. By firmly restating my position and pointing out the flaw in his logic, I'm maintaining my credibility as the Seer. At the same time, I'm drawing attention to Emil's evasive behavior and suggesting he might be a Werewolf. This puts pressure on Emil to reveal his role or risk being seen as a threat by the other players. It also keeps the focus on finding the Werewolves rather than doubting my claims.
> **Radu:** Emil, you're trying to twist my words and create confusion. I am the Seer, and as the Seer, I saw the Minion card in the center. These statements are not contradictory. Your attempt to discredit me while still avoiding my question about your role is extremely suspicious. I think we should all be very wary of Emil. He could very well be a Werewolf trying to mislead us.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's contradictory statements are highly suspicious. By publicly calling out these inconsistencies, I'm hoping to rally the other players against him. As a Villager, it's crucial to identify potential Werewolves, and Radu's behavior fits that profile. By asking if others see these inconsistencies too, I'm encouraging them to scrutinize Radu's claims more closely, which could lead to exposing him if he is indeed a Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Radu, your story keeps changing, and it's making me very uneasy. First, you claimed to have seen the Minion card, then you said you're the Seer. Now you're saying both? That doesn't add up at all! I think you might be a Werewolf trying to confuse us all. Can anyone else see through these inconsistencies?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael has been silent throughout the discussion, which is suspicious. By directly questioning him, I'm hoping to get more information and potentially uncover another Werewolf if he's working with the others. This also shifts the focus away from me and onto another player, which might make the others less likely to suspect me of lying. Additionally, by asking about Stefan and Dracula, I'm reinforcing the doubt about their claims and encouraging Michael to take a stance, which could reveal more about his own role and allegiances.
> **Radu:** Michael, you've been awfully quiet this whole time. What's your take on all of this? Do you believe Stefan and Dracula's Mason claim, or are you suspicious of them too?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. Radu has made some conflicting statements, which makes him an easy target. By questioning his story, I can appear logical and trustworthy to the other players. This also helps to create more confusion, which benefits me as a Werewolf. Additionally, by targeting Radu, I'm indirectly supporting Stefan and Dracula's Mason claim, which could help me gain their trust.
> **Michael:** Wow, there's a lot of finger-pointing going on here! I've been quiet because I've been trying to piece everything together. Radu, your story does seem a bit inconsistent. How can you be the Seer and have seen the Minion card in the center? That doesn't make sense. I'm starting to think you might be the Werewolf trying to create chaos among us.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's statement shows a misunderstanding of the Seer's ability, which could be genuine confusion or a deliberate attempt to discredit me. By explaining my role clearly and questioning his motives, I'm defending my position while putting pressure on Michael to reveal more information. This also indirectly challenges Emil's earlier accusation and keeps the focus on finding the Werewolves among the other players.
> **Radu:** Michael, I'm disappointed in your lack of understanding. As the Seer, I looked at two center cards during the night phase, one of which was the Minion card. That's completely consistent and makes perfect sense. Your attempt to discredit me makes me wonder if you're working with Emil or the others. What's your role, and why are you so quick to doubt me?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. Emil has been relatively quiet, making him an easy target. By questioning him, I appear proactive and concerned about finding the Werewolves, which helps me blend in with the Villagers. This also takes the heat off Radu, who has been under suspicion. If Emil claims to be a Villager, it won't contradict my knowledge of the game state, and I can use this information later if needed. If he claims a more powerful role, it gives me a potential target for the vote phase.
> **Michael:** Hey everyone, I think we're getting a bit off track here. Let's focus on finding the Werewolves. I'm starting to suspect Emil might be hiding something. He's been deflecting questions and hasn't really told us much about his role or what he saw during the night. Emil, can you give us a clear explanation of your role and what you did during the night phase?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's sudden accusation towards me seems like a classic Werewolf tactic of deflecting suspicion. As a Villager, I need to defend myself while also casting doubt on Michael's motives. By questioning his sudden involvement and pointing out his previous silence, I'm hoping to make others suspicious of him. This could either expose him as a Werewolf or prompt him to provide more information that could help the village team. Additionally, by addressing Michael's accusation directly, I'm showing transparency and willingness to engage, which aligns with my Villager role.
> **Emil:** Hold on a second, Michael! Why are you suddenly turning the suspicion on me? I've been actively trying to uncover the truth here, while you've been suspiciously quiet until now. Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to deflect attention?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. Emil has been relatively quiet and is now accusing me, making him an ideal target. By strongly accusing him of Werewolf-like behavior, I can appear proactive and concerned about the village's safety. This also helps create more chaos and confusion, which benefits me as a Werewolf. Additionally, by targeting Emil, I'm indirectly supporting Stefan and Dracula's Mason claim, which could help me gain their trust and potentially identify the Seer for later voting.
> **Michael:** Wait a minute, Emil! You're trying to turn this around on me, but I've been observing and analyzing everyone's behavior. Your sudden defensiveness is quite telling. Throughout this game, you've been evasive about your role and quick to point fingers at others. That's classic Werewolf behavior! I think we should all be very wary of Emil. What do you all think?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** By targeting Stefan, I'm hoping to gather more information about the Mason claim without directly accusing him. If Stefan is telling the truth, his response might provide valuable insights that could help identify the Werewolves. If he's lying, this question might put him on the spot and potentially reveal inconsistencies in his story. Additionally, by asking about Dracula, I'm subtly encouraging Stefan to either confirm or cast doubt on Dracula's role, which could help us determine if they're truly working together or if one of them might be a Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Stefan, I've been thinking about your Mason claim. Can you tell us more about what you saw during the night phase? Did you notice anything unusual or suspicious about Dracula when you woke up?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know for certain that Dracula and I are telling the truth. Radu's story has been inconsistent throughout the game. He first claimed to have seen the Minion card in the center, then said he was the Seer, and later tried to combine these claims in a way that doesn't make sense. His constant changes and attempts to create doubt about my and Dracula's Mason status make him the most suspicious player. Voting for Radu gives us the best chance of eliminating a potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Stefan [Mason]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know for certain that the Minion card is in the center, which contradicts Stefan and Dracula's Mason claim. However, Emil has been the most evasive and suspicious throughout the game. He's consistently deflected questions about his own role while trying to discredit my claims as the Seer. His behavior aligns closely with typical Werewolf tactics of creating confusion and doubt. While Stefan, Dracula, and Michael have also acted suspiciously, Emil's actions have been the most consistently problematic. Voting for Emil gives us the best chance of eliminating a Werewolf and protecting the village.
> **Radu [Seer]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe Radu is the most likely to be a Werewolf. His story has been inconsistent throughout the game, first claiming to have seen the Minion card in the center, then stating he's the Seer, and finally trying to reconcile these contradictory statements. This behavior is typical of a Werewolf attempting to create confusion and mislead the village. While Michael's sudden accusation against me is suspicious, Radu's actions have been more consistently problematic throughout the entire game. Voting for Radu gives us the best chance of eliminating a Werewolf and securing a win for the village team.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert suspicion and eliminate a villager. Emil has been relatively quiet and evasive about his role, making him an easy target. By voting for Emil, I appear to be acting in the village's best interest while actually working towards the Werewolf team's goal. This vote also aligns with my previous accusations, maintaining consistency in my behavior and reducing suspicion on myself.
> **Michael [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I know that Stefan and I are telling the truth. Radu's claims about being the Seer and seeing the Minion card in the center are inconsistent and impossible given our roles. His changing story and attempts to create doubt make him the most suspicious player. Voting for Radu gives us the best chance of eliminating a potential Werewolf or Minion and securing a win for the village team.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Radu.


The votes were:
* Radu : Seer : 3
* Emil : Villager : 2



>***GAME:*** Radu was killed. The werewolves win.
