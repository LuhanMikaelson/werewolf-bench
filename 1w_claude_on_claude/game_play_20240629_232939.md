## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexandra. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Andrei is a minion and is aware that Alexandra is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Lucian. They are thinking about their action.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I think it's more valuable to confirm another player's role rather than looking at center cards. By checking Andrei's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or confirm a villager role. This information will be crucial during the day phase discussions. If Andrei turns out to be a Werewolf, it gives me a strong lead. If he's not, I can use this information to build trust and potentially identify the real threats. Checking a player also allows me to gauge their reactions during the day, which could provide additional clues about their true role.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect attention away from Alexandra, the actual werewolf. By casting suspicion on Viktor, I'm creating a diversion and potentially setting up a target for elimination that isn't harmful to the werewolf team. This also helps me appear proactive and concerned about finding werewolves, which is how a villager might act. Additionally, by targeting someone who's been quiet, I'm encouraging more discussion, which could reveal information about other players' roles that might be useful later.
> **Andrei:** Hey everyone, I've been thinking... Viktor has been awfully quiet so far. That's pretty suspicious, don't you think? I mean, if he were a villager or had a useful role, wouldn't he be more eager to share information or ask questions? I'm starting to wonder if he might be hiding something... like being a werewolf!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's accusation against me is unfounded and potentially a werewolf tactic to divert attention. As a villager, I need to defend myself and question his motives. By turning the spotlight back on him, I can gauge his reaction and potentially expose him if he's a werewolf. This also shows the other players that I'm actively participating and willing to challenge suspicious behavior.
> **Viktor:** Whoa, hold on there, Andrei! I've been quiet because I've been trying to observe and gather information. But since you're so eager to point fingers, let me ask you this: What exactly have YOU contributed to help the village? It seems awfully convenient that you're trying to shift suspicion onto me right off the bat.


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to keep the heat on Viktor to divert attention from Alexandra, the actual werewolf. By pressing Viktor for specifics about his role, I'm putting him in a difficult position. If he claims a powerful role like Seer, it might make him a target for elimination. If he claims to be a Villager, it doesn't explain his silence. Either way, this keeps the focus on him and away from Alexandra. Additionally, by being aggressive and seemingly pro-village, I'm further cementing my facade as a concerned villager, making it less likely that others will suspect me of being the Minion.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, I appreciate your attempt to deflect, but let's be real here. I've been actively trying to figure out who the werewolves are since the start. What about you? Can you tell us what role you have that's so important you needed to stay quiet and 'observe'? Because from where I'm sitting, it looks like you're just trying to avoid suspicion. Come on, give us something concrete!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's continued aggression towards me is worrying. As a villager, I need to defend myself while also turning the tables on him. By challenging him to reveal his role, I'm putting pressure on him to either come clean or potentially expose himself as a werewolf. This also shows the other players that I'm not afraid to confront suspicious behavior, which aligns with my villager role. Additionally, by suggesting he might be creating chaos, I'm planting seeds of doubt about his motives in other players' minds.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, your aggressive questioning is making me more suspicious of you than anyone else. If you're so concerned about roles, why don't you tell us yours? Or are you just trying to create chaos to hide your own identity as a werewolf?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to maintain pressure on Viktor while also deflecting suspicion from myself. By reaffirming my 'openness' and 'engagement', I'm portraying myself as a concerned villager. Bringing Lucian into the conversation serves two purposes: it takes some heat off Viktor (potentially preserving him as a distraction for later) and it spreads suspicion to another player who isn't Alexandra (the actual werewolf). This move keeps the village team busy with internal suspicions while protecting the werewolf team's interests.
> **Andrei:** Look, I understand the tension here, but Viktor, your attempt to turn this around on me isn't going to work. I've been open from the start, trying to engage everyone in discussion to figure out who the werewolves are. That's what a loyal villager would do. Now, instead of deflecting, why don't you answer my question? What role do you have that's so crucial you needed to stay quiet? And Lucian, you've been awfully quiet too. What are your thoughts on all this?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from Viktor, who's currently under fire, without seeming too defensive of him. By calling for a more measured approach, I'm trying to appear rational and village-oriented. Asking for information about the night phase is a calculated risk - I know there's no other Werewolf, so any Seer claim can be potentially discredited later. This also gives me an opportunity to gauge who might be the Seer or other important roles, which will be useful for the voting phase.
> **Alexandra:** Wow, things are getting heated! Let's take a step back and think about this logically. Andrei, while I understand your suspicion of Viktor, I think we need to be careful about jumping to conclusions too quickly. It's possible Viktor was just being cautious. That being said, Viktor, your defensive reaction is a bit concerning. Maybe instead of accusing each other, we should focus on what information we can share to help the village. Does anyone have any useful insights from the night phase?


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have concrete information about Andrei's role. Revealing this information is crucial for the village team to identify potential threats. By exposing Andrei as the Minion, we can discredit his accusations against Viktor and potentially uncover the Werewolves. This move also establishes my credibility as the Seer and encourages others to share their information.
> **Lucian:** Andrei, I have some important information to share. During the night, I used my Seer ability to look at your card, and I saw that you're the Minion. This means you're working with the Werewolves! Everyone, we need to be very careful about trusting Andrei's accusations.


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to discredit Lucian's accusation immediately. By questioning the logic of his claim and turning the accusation back on him, I'm attempting to sow doubt among the other players. Suggesting that Lucian might be the real Werewolf serves two purposes: it takes the heat off me and potentially sets up Lucian as a target for elimination, which would benefit the Werewolf team. This aggressive defense also reinforces my image as a passionate villager fighting against false accusations.
> **Andrei:** Whoa, Lucian! That's a bold accusation you're making there. But let's think about this for a second. If I were really the Minion, why would I be so actively trying to find the Werewolves? That doesn't make any sense! I think you're just trying to divert attention from yourself. In fact, isn't it convenient that you claim to be the Seer right when things are getting heated? I bet you're the real Werewolf here, trying to frame me!


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to stand firm on my Seer claim and the information I've revealed. By directly confronting Andrei and asking him to explain his actions, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal more information or potentially slip up. This also reinforces my credibility to the other players and keeps the focus on Andrei's suspicious behavior.
> **Lucian:** Andrei, your defense doesn't hold up. As the Seer, I have no reason to lie about what I saw. The fact that you're trying to accuse me of being a Werewolf only reinforces my suspicion. Can you explain why, as the Minion, you're so actively trying to create conflict?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to discredit Lucian's accusation and redirect suspicion. By questioning the logic of his claim and suggesting he might be the Werewolf, I'm attempting to sow doubt among the other players. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me, potentially sets up Lucian as a target for elimination (which would benefit the Werewolf team), and reinforces my image as a passionate villager fighting against false accusations. By involving the other players and asking for their thoughts, I'm also trying to create more discussion and potentially gather more information that could be useful for the Werewolf team.
> **Andrei:** Listen, everyone. I know tensions are high, but we need to think critically here. Lucian's claim about being the Seer and accusing me of being the Minion doesn't add up. If I were truly the Minion, why would I be so vocal about finding the Werewolves? That would be counterproductive to my supposed role. I think Lucian is trying to mislead us all. In fact, I'm starting to suspect that Lucian might be the Werewolf himself, trying to create chaos and frame an innocent player. What do you all think about this?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather more information to identify the Werewolves. Lucian's claim of being the Seer is crucial, and if true, it exposes Andrei as the Minion. By asking Lucian for more details about his Seer actions, I can potentially verify his claim and gather more information to help the village. This also puts pressure on Lucian to provide more details if he's telling the truth, or potentially expose himself if he's lying. Additionally, this question shows that I'm actively participating and trying to help the village, countering Andrei's earlier accusation of my silence.
> **Viktor:** Hold on a second, everyone! Lucian's claim about being the Seer and seeing Andrei as the Minion is a game-changer. Andrei, your aggressive behavior from the start now makes sense if you're trying to cause chaos as the Minion. But Lucian, if you're really the Seer, can you tell us if you looked at anyone else's card or any center cards?


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Viktor's question and then immediately turning the focus back to Andrei, I'm accomplishing several things. First, I'm maintaining my credibility as the Seer by being transparent about what I did and didn't do during the night phase. Second, I'm keeping the pressure on Andrei, forcing him to defend his actions rather than allowing him to shift suspicion onto me. This approach should help the other players see the inconsistencies in Andrei's behavior and support my claim about his role as the Minion.
> **Lucian:** Viktor, I appreciate your support, but I want to clarify something. As the Seer, I only looked at Andrei's card during the night phase. I didn't check any center cards or other players. I chose to focus on one player to get solid information. Now, Andrei, your continued aggression and attempts to discredit me are only making you look more suspicious. Can you explain why you're so determined to undermine my role as the Seer?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to discredit Lucian's claim of being the Seer and his accusation against me. By questioning his strategy as the Seer, I'm sowing doubt about his role. Accusing him of being the Werewolf serves two purposes: it deflects suspicion from me and potentially sets up Lucian for elimination, which would benefit the Werewolf team. This aggressive defense also reinforces my image as a passionate villager fighting against what I claim to be false accusations. By involving the other players in considering this possibility, I'm attempting to shift the group's focus away from me and onto Lucian, all while appearing to be working in the village's best interest.
> **Andrei:** Look, I understand why you might be suspicious of me, but I assure you all, I am NOT the Minion. Lucian, your claim about being the Seer doesn't add up. If you really were the Seer, why would you only look at one player's card? That seems like a waste of such a powerful ability. I think you're bluffing to cover your own tracks. Everyone, we need to consider the possibility that Lucian is actually the Werewolf trying to frame me!


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly challenging Andrei again, I'm maintaining pressure on him and exposing the flaws in his logic. His aggressive behavior and attempts to discredit me align perfectly with the Minion role. By asking him to explain his strategy, I'm forcing him to either reveal more information or potentially contradict himself. This approach also reinforces my position as the Seer to the other players and keeps the focus on Andrei's suspicious actions.
> **Lucian:** Andrei, your defense is getting weaker by the minute. If you're not the Minion, why are you so desperate to discredit me? A true villager would be more interested in finding the Werewolves than attacking the Seer. Can you explain your strategy here?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect attention away from myself and Alexandra (the actual Werewolf). By accusing Selene, who has been quiet, I'm creating a new target for suspicion. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me, potentially sets up an innocent player for elimination (benefiting the Werewolf team), and makes me appear proactive in finding the Werewolves. Additionally, by pointing out Selene's silence, I'm encouraging more discussion, which could reveal information about other players' roles that might be useful for the Werewolf team. This move also helps to discredit Lucian's accusation against me by suggesting that he might be missing the real threat.
> **Andrei:** Listen, everyone. I think we're getting sidetracked here. While Lucian is busy trying to frame me, we're losing sight of the real threat. I've been vocal because I genuinely want to find the Werewolves. But you know who's been suspiciously quiet this whole time? Selene. She hasn't contributed anything to our discussion. For all we know, she could be the Werewolf, sitting back and watching us tear each other apart!


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's attempt to deflect attention onto me seems like a desperate move. As a Villager, I need to defend myself while also trying to uncover more information. By questioning Andrei directly, I'm giving him a chance to explain himself while also potentially revealing more inconsistencies in his story. This could help us determine if he's really the Minion as Lucian claims.
> **Selene:** Andrei, I find it interesting that you're suddenly trying to shift suspicion onto me. Is this because you're feeling cornered after Lucian's revelation? Can you explain why you think I'm suspicious when I've been trying to follow the conversation closely?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to continue deflecting suspicion from myself and Alexandra (the Werewolf) while also sowing doubt about Lucian's claim of being the Seer. By questioning Lucian's strategy and bringing attention back to Selene's silence, I'm creating multiple targets for suspicion. This serves to confuse the village team and make it harder for them to identify the real Werewolf. Additionally, by calling for more information from others, I'm appearing proactive and concerned about the village's welfare, which helps maintain my cover as a villager. This approach also opens up the possibility of gathering more information that could be useful for the Werewolf team.
> **Andrei:** Everyone, I think we're getting too caught up in personal accusations here. We need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Lucian claims to be the Seer, but his actions don't make sense. A real Seer would have tried to gather more information, not just look at one player's card. And Selene, your silence throughout this discussion is unsettling. Are you trying to avoid drawing attention to yourself? We need to consider all possibilities here. Who else has information that could help us identify the real threat?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** By directly questioning Andrei, I'm giving him a chance to defend himself while also potentially exposing more inconsistencies in his story. His aggressive behavior and attempts to deflect attention onto others, including me, align with Lucian's claim about him being the Minion. As a Villager, it's crucial to uncover the truth and identify potential threats to the village. By putting pressure on Andrei, I might be able to provoke a reaction that reveals more about his true role.
> **Selene:** Andrei, your sudden attempt to shift suspicion onto me is quite telling. I've been carefully observing and processing all the information shared so far. Now, let me ask you this: If you're truly innocent, why are you so quick to accuse others without substantial evidence? It seems like you're trying to create chaos to distract us from Lucian's claim about your role as the Minion. Can you provide any concrete information that proves your innocence?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect attention from myself and protect Alexandra, who I know is the Werewolf. By directing a question to Alexandra, I'm giving her an opportunity to speak and potentially clear herself of suspicion. This also makes me appear more cooperative and interested in gathering information from all players, reinforcing my facade as a concerned villager. Additionally, by mentioning the lack of solid evidence, I'm subtly undermining Lucian's claim about my role. This approach keeps the village team busy with discussions while protecting the Werewolf team's interests.
> **Andrei:** Look, I understand everyone's suspicions, but we're getting nowhere by throwing accusations around without solid evidence. I've been trying to find the Werewolves because that's what a loyal villager would do. Now, Alexandra has been awfully quiet throughout this whole ordeal. Alexandra, what's your take on all of this? Do you have any insights that could help us identify the real threat?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion from myself while also appearing to contribute to the village's cause. By supporting Lucian's claim and targeting Andrei, I'm distancing myself from potential werewolf suspicion. This also helps create more chaos and division among the players, which benefits the werewolf team. Additionally, if Andrei is indeed the Minion, my accusation might force him to defend himself more vigorously, potentially exposing his role and taking heat off me.
> **Alexandra:** I've been carefully listening to everyone's arguments, and I must say, I'm growing increasingly suspicious of Andrei. His aggressive accusations and constant deflection are classic werewolf tactics. Lucian's claim about being the Seer and identifying Andrei as the Minion seems credible to me. Andrei, if you're truly innocent, why are you so desperately trying to discredit Lucian and shift suspicion onto others? Your behavior is not helping the village at all.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect Alexandra (the Werewolf) and eliminate villagers. Voting for Lucian serves multiple purposes: it removes a potential Seer, which is a significant threat to the Werewolf team, and it helps maintain my cover as a villager by appearing to act on my earlier accusations against him. This vote also keeps suspicion away from Alexandra and myself, furthering our team's chances of winning.
> **Andrei [Minion]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover and appear to be helping the village. Voting for Andrei serves multiple purposes: it aligns with Lucian's Seer claim, which I've publicly supported to gain trust; it targets the player who's been most aggressive and therefore most likely to be eliminated, potentially saving me from suspicion; and if Andrei is indeed the Minion, eliminating him won't harm the Werewolf team. This vote allows me to blend in with the villagers while still working towards the Werewolf victory condition.
> **Alexandra [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have concrete evidence that Andrei is the Minion. His aggressive behavior, constant deflection, and attempts to discredit me align perfectly with the Minion role. He's been trying to create chaos and turn players against each other, which is exactly what a Minion would do to help the Werewolves. By eliminating Andrei, we remove a key ally of the Werewolves and increase our chances of identifying and eliminating the actual Werewolves in subsequent rounds. This vote is crucial for the village team's victory.
> **Lucian [Seer]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe voting for Andrei is the best course of action. Lucian's claim of being the Seer and identifying Andrei as the Minion is the strongest piece of information we have. Andrei's aggressive behavior, constant deflection, and attempts to discredit others align with typical Minion tactics. His actions have been more about creating chaos than helping the village. While there's always a chance of deception, voting for Andrei gives us the best odds of eliminating a threat to the village based on the information available.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe voting for Andrei is the best course of action. Lucian's claim of being the Seer and identifying Andrei as the Minion seems credible. Andrei's aggressive behavior, constant deflection, and attempts to create chaos align with what we'd expect from a Minion. His efforts to discredit Lucian and shift suspicion onto others, including myself, without providing any substantial evidence to prove his innocence, further reinforce this suspicion. While there's always a possibility of deception, eliminating Andrei seems to be the safest bet to protect the village based on the information we have.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Minion : 4
* Lucian : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Andrei was killed. The werewolves win.
