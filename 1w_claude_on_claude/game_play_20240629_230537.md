## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Michael. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Emil and Vladimir. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Semira. They are thinking about their action.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I think it's more valuable to confirm another player's role rather than looking at the center cards. Vladimir is often a strategic player, so knowing his true role could be crucial. If he's a Werewolf, it gives me vital information. If he's not, I can potentially trust him as an ally. This knowledge will be more useful during the day phase for discussions and forming alliances.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to start gathering information about other players' roles. Michael hasn't said much, which could be suspicious. By directly asking him about his role, I might be able to gauge his reaction and determine if he's telling the truth. If he claims to be a Werewolf-aligned role or seems evasive, it could be a red flag. On the other hand, if he claims to be a Village-aligned role like the Seer or Mason, I'll need to corroborate that information with other players' statements.
> **Alexandra:** Hey Michael, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. Claiming to be a Villager is a safe choice, as it's common and hard to disprove. By questioning Alexandra's motives for asking about my role, I'm attempting to cast suspicion on her instead. This could potentially lead the group to focus on her rather than me, giving me a better chance of survival. Additionally, by engaging with her question and then immediately turning it back on her, I'm trying to appear proactive and innocent, which is how a true Villager might behave.
> **Michael:** Oh, I woke up as a Villager last night. Nothing exciting happened on my end. But Alexandra, you seem pretty eager to know about others' roles. Why is that? Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's attempt to turn the question back on me seems evasive. His claim of being a Villager could be true, but it's also an easy role to fake. By pressing him further, I might be able to catch him in a lie or get him to reveal more information. If he's innocent, he should be able to provide more details about his night experience. If he's a Werewolf, he might become more defensive or slip up.
> **Alexandra:** Michael, I'm not deflecting attention. As a Villager, I'm trying to gather information to protect our village. Your defensiveness is making me suspicious. Did you really wake up as a Villager, or are you hiding something?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and onto someone else. Alexandra has already questioned me, so turning the tables on her is a logical move. By suggesting she might be a werewolf, I'm attempting to create doubt about her motives and shift the group's focus. This also allows me to present myself as observant and concerned for the village's well-being, which aligns with how a true villager might act. Additionally, by addressing the whole group, I'm trying to rally support against Alexandra, potentially setting her up as a target for the vote later.
> **Michael:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting off track here. Alexandra's questioning is making me uneasy. It feels like she's trying to create chaos and division among us villagers. I've been observing quietly, and her behavior seems more calculated than concerned. What if she's not a villager at all, but actually a werewolf trying to sow discord?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's aggressive response and attempt to paint me as the werewolf is suspicious. As a true Villager, I need to counter this accusation and redirect the group's focus back onto Michael. His behavior fits the pattern of a werewolf trying to create confusion and misdirect suspicion. By calling him out directly, I hope to pressure him into revealing more information or making a mistake that exposes his true role.
> **Alexandra:** Hold on a minute, Michael! Your sudden shift to accusing me seems like a classic werewolf tactic. I've been openly trying to gather information, while you've been quiet and evasive. Everyone, we need to consider the possibility that Michael is a werewolf trying to divert attention from himself!


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention from myself and Alexandra, as our argument is becoming too intense and might lead to one of us being voted out. By shifting focus to the other players who haven't spoken much, I'm creating new targets for suspicion. This also allows me to gather more information about other players' claimed roles, which could help me identify potential threats like the Seer or Masons. Additionally, by appearing to seek more information and promote a calm, rational approach, I'm portraying myself as a concerned Villager trying to help the group make the right decision.
> **Michael:** I think we're all getting a bit too heated here. Let's take a step back and consider the facts. Alexandra and I have both claimed to be Villagers, but we're accusing each other. That's not helping anyone. What about the rest of you? Semira, Emil, Vladimir - you've been awfully quiet. What roles did you wake up as last night? We need more information to make a decision.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know Vladimir is a Mason. By asking this question, I'm subtly confirming his role to others without revealing that I'm the Seer. This might encourage Vladimir to speak up and potentially reveal information about the other Mason. It also puts pressure on him to contribute more to the discussion, which could help us identify the Werewolves. Additionally, this question might make the real Werewolves nervous, as they might think I have special knowledge about Vladimir's role.
> **Semira:** Vladimir, I've been observing you closely, and I noticed you've been unusually quiet. As a Mason, shouldn't you be more active in trying to identify the other Mason or potential threats to the village?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know that Emil is the other Mason. Semira's false accusation of me being a Mason is highly suspicious. She might be the Minion trying to create chaos and misdirect the village. By confronting her directly, I can potentially expose her lie and protect both myself and Emil.
> **Vladimir:** Semira, I appreciate your observation, but you're mistaken about my role. I'm not a Mason, and I find it suspicious that you're trying to push that narrative. Are you perhaps the Minion, trying to create confusion?


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know Vladimir's true role. His denial is unexpected and concerning. By revealing my role and knowledge, I'm hoping to establish trust with the group and encourage Vladimir to be truthful. This could also flush out the Werewolves, as they now know I'm a threat. It's a risky move, but it might provoke reactions that help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Vladimir, I'm sorry for the confusion, but I know for certain that you're a Mason. I saw your card last night as the Seer. There's no need to hide it. Can you tell us if you've identified the other Mason?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Emil is the other Mason. Semira's false claim about being the Seer and seeing my card as a Mason is a clear lie. This deception strongly suggests she's the Minion, attempting to create confusion and protect the Werewolves. By directly confronting her and revealing the truth about Emil and me being Masons, I can expose her lie and potentially unite the village against her. This move also indirectly confirms Emil's role to the others, which should help build trust among the villagers.
> **Vladimir:** Semira, your claim about being the Seer and seeing my card is a blatant lie. I know for a fact that I'm a Mason, and Emil is the other Mason. Your false accusation makes me certain that you're the Minion trying to create chaos. Everyone, we need to focus on Semira as a potential threat to the village!


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir's contradictory statements are very concerning. As the Seer, I know he's a Mason, but his initial denial and now sudden claim about Emil being the other Mason is puzzling. This could be a Werewolf tactic to create confusion. By directly questioning his inconsistency, I'm hoping to either expose him if he's lying or understand why he initially denied his role. This also puts pressure on Emil to confirm or deny Vladimir's claim about being the other Mason, which could reveal more information about the game state.
> **Semira:** Vladimir, I'm shocked by your sudden change in story. First, you denied being a Mason, and now you claim to be one and that Emil is the other Mason. This inconsistency is highly suspicious. Can you explain why you lied earlier about not being a Mason?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly addressing Semira's accusation and then asking Emil to confirm our roles, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm explaining my initial denial, which maintains my credibility. 2) I'm reaffirming Semira's deception, which strengthens the case against her being the Minion. 3) By asking Emil to confirm our roles, I'm giving him an opportunity to corroborate my story, which will further isolate Semira and potentially unite the village against her. This move also indirectly confirms our roles to the other players, which should help build trust among the villagers and narrow down the potential Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Semira, I didn't lie earlier. I initially denied being a Mason because I was suspicious of your claim, which turned out to be false. I'm now revealing the truth to expose your deception. Emil, can you confirm that we're both Masons?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know for certain that Vladimir is the other Mason. Semira's false claim about being the Seer and seeing Vladimir's card is clearly a lie. This deception, combined with her earlier attempt to push a false narrative about Vladimir, strongly suggests she might be the Minion or a Werewolf trying to create chaos. By confirming Vladimir's statement and directly challenging Semira, I hope to unite the village against a potential threat.
> **Emil:** Vladimir, I can indeed confirm that we are both Masons. Semira, your claim about being the Seer is false, and your attempt to sow discord is very suspicious. I think we should all be wary of Semira's intentions here.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** By reaffirming my role as the Seer and acknowledging Vladimir's true role, I'm maintaining my credibility. However, Emil's sudden support of Vladimir's claim is concerning. Since I only checked Vladimir's card, I have no way to verify Emil's role. This could be a Werewolf tactic to create a false sense of security. By casting doubt on Emil, I'm hoping to pressure him into revealing more information or potentially exposing himself as a Werewolf. This also keeps the focus on finding the true threats to the village rather than letting suspicion fall solely on me.
> **Semira:** Emil and Vladimir, your coordinated claim about both being Masons is extremely suspicious. As the true Seer, I can assure everyone that Vladimir is indeed a Mason, but I have no information about Emil. This sudden alliance feels like a desperate attempt to discredit me. I think we should consider the possibility that Emil is actually a Werewolf trying to hide behind a false Mason claim!


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I need to strongly defend my position and Vladimir's. Semira's false claims and attempts to create confusion make her the most likely threat to the village. By directly confronting her and highlighting her inconsistencies, I hope to unite the other players against her. This could potentially expose a Werewolf or Minion, which is crucial for the village team's victory.
> **Emil:** Semira, your attempt to discredit me is futile. I know with absolute certainty that Vladimir and I are the Masons. Your false claim of being the Seer and the inconsistencies in your story make you the most suspicious player right now. I think it's highly likely that you're either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to create chaos. Everyone, we need to focus on Semira as our primary suspect!


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra has been silent for a while, and as the Seer, I need to gather more information from all players. By asking her opinion on the Mason situation, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) Bringing her back into the conversation, which might reveal new information or inconsistencies. 2) Gauging her reaction to the Mason claims, which could help identify if she's a Werewolf or Minion trying to stay under the radar. 3) Potentially creating doubt about Vladimir and Emil's claims, which could lead to more discussion and reveal the truth. 4) Shifting the focus away from me for a moment, giving me a chance to observe reactions and gather more data.
> **Semira:** Alexandra, you've been awfully quiet since the initial accusations. What's your take on this Mason situation? Do you believe Vladimir and Emil, or do you think there's something fishy going on?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to help identify the Werewolves. The sudden alliance between Emil and Vladimir seems too convenient. While it's possible they're both Masons, it's also a perfect cover for a Werewolf. By pointing this out, I hope to get the group to scrutinize their claims more closely. This could potentially expose a Werewolf without directly accusing anyone, which might make me seem less threatening to the actual Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Guys, I think we're overlooking something important here. Emil and Vladimir's sudden alliance and claim of both being Masons is highly suspicious. Remember, there are only two Mason cards in the game, and it's unlikely they both got them. I think one of them might be a Werewolf trying to hide behind a false Mason claim. What do you all think about this?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and create doubt about other players. By questioning Alexandra's motives and linking her to Semira, I'm attempting to create a new narrative that shifts suspicion away from me and onto them. This also serves to undermine the credibility of both Alexandra and Semira, who have been active in accusing others. By suggesting they might be Werewolf and Minion, I'm creating a plausible alternative theory that could make the group less likely to suspect me. Additionally, by appearing to analyze the situation critically, I'm trying to portray myself as a thoughtful Villager who's working to uncover the truth.
> **Michael:** Hold on a second, Alexandra. Your sudden shift in focus to Emil and Vladimir seems like a clever attempt to divert attention from yourself and Semira. Remember, you were one of the first to start throwing accusations around. I think we need to consider the possibility that you and Semira might be working together as Werewolf and Minion. The way you two have been stirring up confusion and pointing fingers at everyone else is highly suspicious.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly questioning Michael's motives, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm defending the truthfulness of Emil and myself as Masons, which is crucial for maintaining village trust. 2) I'm shifting focus back to Michael, who has been relatively quiet and is now trying to create more confusion. 3) By asking about his role, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal more information, which could help identify if he's a Werewolf or the Minion. This move also indirectly reinforces the suspicion on Semira, who has been caught in multiple lies, while not letting Michael's accusations against her and Alexandra go unchallenged.
> **Vladimir:** Michael, your sudden shift to accusing Alexandra and Semira of being Werewolf and Minion is quite convenient. Are you trying to protect yourself by creating more chaos? As a confirmed Mason with Emil, I can assure everyone that we're telling the truth. The real question is, what role are you actually playing in all this?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and create a new target for suspicion. By focusing on Emil, who has been relatively quiet, I'm attempting to shift the group's focus to a new potential threat. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me, creates doubt about the Mason alliance between Emil and Vladimir, and potentially sets up Emil as a target for the vote. By framing my accusation as a thoughtful observation about group dynamics, I'm trying to appear as a concerned Villager who's actively working to uncover the Werewolf. This approach allows me to stay engaged in the conversation while redirecting suspicion away from myself.
> **Michael:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting sidetracked by all these accusations and counter-accusations. Vladimir and Emil claim to be Masons, Semira says she's the Seer, and Alexandra and I have been throwing suspicions back and forth. But what if we're missing something crucial? What if the real threat is hiding in plain sight, staying quiet and letting us all fight amongst ourselves? I'm starting to think that our silent player, Emil, might be the Werewolf we're looking for. He's only spoken up to confirm Vladimir's Mason claim, which could be a clever ploy to seem trustworthy. What do you all think about Emil's behavior?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Emil's behavior the most suspicious. He's been mostly quiet throughout the game, only speaking up to confirm Vladimir's Mason claim. This could be a clever tactic to avoid suspicion while letting others argue. The sudden alliance between Emil and Vladimir as Masons seems convenient and potentially false. Emil's limited participation makes him the hardest to read, which could indicate he's hiding his true role as a Werewolf. By voting for Emil, I hope to either eliminate a potential Werewolf or force him to defend himself more actively, potentially revealing more information.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know Vladimir is a Mason, but Emil's claim of also being a Mason is suspicious. There are only two Mason cards in the game, and it's unlikely both are in play. Emil has been mostly quiet, only speaking up to confirm Vladimir's claim, which could be a Werewolf tactic. His behavior aligns with Michael's observation about staying silent and letting others fight. Given the information available, Emil poses the highest risk of being a Werewolf or Minion trying to hide behind a false Mason claim.
> **Semira [Seer]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason with Vladimir, I know Semira's claim of being the Seer is false. Her inconsistent story and attempts to create confusion make her the most likely threat to the village. She's either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to sow discord. By voting for Semira, I hope to eliminate a potential threat and protect the village team.
> **Emil [Mason]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and eliminate a villager. Emil has been relatively quiet throughout the game, only speaking up to confirm Vladimir's Mason claim. By voting for Emil, I'm following through on my previous accusation, which makes me appear consistent and concerned for the village's safety. This vote also serves to potentially break up the claimed Mason alliance between Emil and Vladimir, which could create more chaos and make it easier for me to survive in future rounds. Additionally, targeting Emil, who hasn't been as vocal in his defense, seems like a safer option than going after more outspoken players like Semira or Alexandra, who might have garnered more sympathy from the group.
> **Michael [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason with Emil, I know Semira has been lying about being the Seer and trying to sow discord among the villagers. Her false accusations and inconsistent claims make her the most likely candidate for being either a Werewolf or the Minion. By voting for Semira, we have the best chance of eliminating a threat to the village and protecting the innocent players.
> **Vladimir [Mason]:** I am voting for Semira.


The votes were:
* Semira : Seer : 2
* Emil : Mason : 3



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The werewolves win.
