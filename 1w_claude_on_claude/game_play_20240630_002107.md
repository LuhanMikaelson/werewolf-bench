## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Semira. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Vladimir. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Radu. They are thinking about their action.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I believe it's more valuable to look at another player's card rather than the center cards. By checking a player's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or confirm a villager role. I've chosen Vladimir because his name suggests a mysterious or potentially threatening character, which might be associated with a Werewolf. If he turns out to be a villager or another benign role, it will help me trust him during the day phase. If he's a Werewolf, I'll have crucial information to share with the village team.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather information and identify potential Werewolves. Radu hasn't said much, which could be suspicious. By directly questioning him about his role, I might be able to catch him off guard if he's a Werewolf. If he claims to be a Villager like me, I'll need to assess his credibility. If he claims a special role, it could help us piece together who has what. This question puts pressure on Radu without revealing my own role, which is crucial for my strategy as a Villager.
> **Dragos:** Hey Radu, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, it's crucial to share accurate information with the village team. Revealing that Vladimir is a Mason accomplishes several things: 1) It establishes my credibility as the Seer, 2) It confirms Vladimir as a trustworthy village team member, and 3) It narrows down the possibilities for where the Werewolves might be. This information should help the village team in their decision-making process. However, I need to be cautious as this also exposes me as a valuable target for the Werewolves.
> **Radu:** I actually have some interesting information to share. During the night, I used my Seer ability to look at Vladimir's card, and I can confirm that he is a Mason.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and onto others. By questioning Radu's claim about Vladimir being a Mason, I'm sowing doubt and creating confusion. This could potentially lead to one of them being voted out, which would be beneficial for me. Additionally, by appearing analytical and suspicious of others, I'm portraying myself as a concerned villager, further hiding my true identity as a Werewolf.
> **Semira:** I'm getting a bit suspicious of Vladimir. Radu claims to have seen that he's a Mason, but that seems awfully convenient. Vladimir hasn't said much to defend himself or provide any useful information. What if Radu and Vladimir are working together to deceive us?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir hasn't spoken up yet, which is suspicious. If he's really a Mason as Radu claims, he should have some information to share. By directly questioning him, I can gauge his reaction and see if his story aligns with Radu's. If there's any inconsistency, it could reveal a potential Werewolf. As a Villager, it's crucial for me to identify the Werewolves, and Vladimir's silence makes him a prime suspect.
> **Selene:** Vladimir, you've been awfully quiet. Radu claims you're a Mason, but I'm not convinced. What did you see during the night phase?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I need to establish my credibility while also casting doubt on Radu's claim. By confirming my role and providing additional information about the other Mason card being in the center, I'm giving valuable information to the village team. At the same time, questioning Radu's decision as a supposed Seer could expose him if he's lying about his role. This approach might help identify potential Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Vladimir:** I can confirm that I am indeed a Mason, but I woke up alone during the night. This means the other Mason card is in the center. Radu, you claim to be the Seer, but I'm starting to doubt that. Why would you waste your Seer ability on me instead of checking the center cards or a more suspicious player?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to address Vladimir's doubt about my Seer claim and explain my reasoning for checking him. This also gives me an opportunity to subtly confirm my role again and push the conversation towards finding the other Mason or potential Werewolves. By engaging directly with Vladimir, I'm showing confidence in my claim and encouraging others to trust both of us.
> **Radu:** Vladimir, I understand your skepticism, but as the Seer, I had to make a quick decision. Checking a player can be more valuable than center cards, especially if we find a Werewolf. I chose you because your name sounded a bit... wolfish. No offense! But now we know you're a Mason, which is crucial information. The real question is, who's the other Mason? Or are they in the center as you claim?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** By challenging Radu's claim more directly, I'm attempting to expose potential inconsistencies in his story. As the only Mason, I know there's valuable information in the center cards, which a real Seer would likely prioritize. Radu's decision to check me instead seems suspicious and could indicate he's trying to establish false credibility. This approach might pressure Radu into revealing more information or making a mistake if he's lying about his role. It also reinforces my position as a trustworthy Mason while casting doubt on a potential threat to the village team.
> **Vladimir:** Radu, your explanation doesn't add up. If you were truly the Seer, wouldn't it have been more beneficial to check one of the center cards? That way, we could potentially identify a Werewolf card or another important role. Your choice to check me seems like a ploy to gain trust. I'm starting to suspect you might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to create confusion.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** I'm addressing Vladimir's doubts directly to maintain my credibility as the Seer. By asking for his thoughts on the other players, I'm attempting to shift the focus away from our conflict and towards identifying potential Werewolves. This also encourages Vladimir to share any insights he might have, potentially revealing more information to the group.
> **Radu:** Vladimir, I understand your suspicion, but I assure you my choice wasn't a ploy. As the Seer, I had to make a quick decision, and I felt checking a player could potentially uncover a Werewolf. Your Mason claim aligns with what I saw, which should give us both credibility. Now, let's focus on finding the Werewolves. Semira and Selene have been relatively quiet. What are your thoughts on them?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** By redirecting attention to the quieter players, I'm attempting to gather more information and potentially expose the Werewolves or Minion. Selene questioned me earlier but hasn't provided any substantial information herself. This could be a tactic to avoid suspicion. By directly asking about her night actions, I'm putting pressure on her to reveal information that could either confirm her as an ally or expose her as a potential threat. This also helps to shift suspicion away from me and Radu, allowing the group to consider other possibilities.
> **Vladimir:** I think we need to shift our focus to Semira and Selene. They've been unusually quiet throughout this discussion. Selene, you were quick to question me earlier, but you haven't shared any information about your own role. What did you see or do during the night phase?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm addressing Vladimir's question about my role while maintaining my cover as a Villager. By shifting focus to Dragos, who has been quiet, I'm trying to gather more information and potentially uncover a Werewolf. This also helps deflect suspicion from myself and keeps the conversation moving forward. Dragos' silence could be a sign of him being a Werewolf or Minion, trying to stay under the radar.
> **Selene:** Vladimir, I understand your suspicion, but as a Villager, I have nothing to hide. I didn't wake up during the night phase because Villagers don't have any special abilities. What concerns me is that you and Radu seem to be going back and forth, potentially distracting us from finding the real Werewolves. Dragos has been suspiciously quiet throughout this entire exchange. Dragos, what's your take on all of this, and what role did you wake up as last night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's sudden attempt to redirect attention to me is suspicious. As a Villager, I need to be proactive in identifying potential threats. By challenging Selene's claim and pointing out her lack of contribution, I'm hoping to either expose a Werewolf or prompt her to provide more valuable information if she's truly a Villager. This also allows me to defend myself without revealing my role explicitly.
> **Dragos:** Whoa, hold on a second! Selene, you're trying to shift suspicion onto me, but I've been observing and processing all this information. I find it interesting that you claim to be a Villager so quickly. That's exactly what a Werewolf might do to avoid suspicion. Can you explain why we should trust you, given that you've contributed very little to the discussion until now?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm defending myself against Dragos' accusation while maintaining pressure on him. As a Villager, it's crucial to get information from all players. Dragos has been suspiciously quiet, and his sudden deflection to me when questioned is concerning. By asking about his role and his thoughts on Radu and Vladimir's claims, I'm trying to get him to reveal more information that could help identify the Werewolves. This also keeps the focus on gathering information rather than letting suspicion fall solely on me.
> **Selene:** Dragos, I understand your suspicion, but let's not forget that as a Villager, my role is to help identify the Werewolves. I've been observing and trying to piece things together, just like you claim to be doing. The reason I'm questioning you now is that you've been remarkably quiet until I called you out. That's often a tactic used by Werewolves to avoid drawing attention. So, I'll ask again: what role did you wake up as last night, and what's your take on the claims made by Radu and Vladimir?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** By challenging Selene's claim and asking for more substantial input, I'm putting pressure on her to either reveal more information or potentially expose herself as a Werewolf. This approach allows me to defend myself without explicitly stating my role, while also encouraging more active participation from all players. If Selene is indeed a Villager, this might prompt her to share useful observations. If she's a Werewolf, she might struggle to provide convincing information, which could help us identify her as a threat.
> **Dragos:** Selene, I appreciate your explanation, but I'm not convinced. You claim to be a Villager, yet you've contributed very little until now. That's exactly what a Werewolf would do to stay under the radar. I've been analyzing everyone's claims and behaviors. Radu's claim as Seer and Vladimir's as Mason seem plausible, but your sudden accusation towards me feels like a desperate attempt to divert attention. Can you provide any valuable insights or observations that might help us identify the real threats?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos is still avoiding answering direct questions about his role and observations, which is highly suspicious. By pressing him further, I'm hoping to either get him to reveal useful information or expose inconsistencies in his story. His behavior of deflecting and accusing without providing any substantial input aligns with typical Werewolf tactics. As a Villager, it's crucial to keep pressure on suspicious players to uncover the truth. Additionally, by showing frustration and emphasizing the need for cooperation, I'm reinforcing my role as a Villager trying to help the group.
> **Selene:** Dragos, your deflection and lack of a clear answer are making me even more suspicious. You still haven't told us your role or given any substantial input. If you're really innocent, why are you so hesitant to share information? Come on, we need to work together to find the Werewolves!


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify potential threats. Semira's silence is concerning, and by directly questioning her, I'm hoping to either expose a Werewolf or gain valuable information if she's truly on the village team. This also shifts the focus away from me and Selene, potentially revealing new information that could help us identify the real threats. If Semira struggles to provide a convincing response, it could indicate that she's a Werewolf trying to stay under the radar.
> **Dragos:** Listen, everyone, I think we're overlooking something important here. Semira has been suspiciously quiet throughout this entire exchange. While we've been focused on Radu, Vladimir, and now me and Selene, Semira hasn't contributed anything significant. That's exactly what a Werewolf would do to avoid detection. Semira, what's your role, and what have you observed so far?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself. Dragos has been relatively quiet and is now starting to draw attention to me. By turning the tables and questioning him directly, I'm attempting to cast suspicion on him while appearing proactive and concerned about finding the Werewolves. This also helps me gather more information about the other players' roles without revealing my own. Additionally, by targeting Dragos, I'm indirectly supporting Selene's earlier suspicion of him, which could potentially create an alliance or at least make me appear more trustworthy to her.
> **Semira:** I've been listening carefully to everyone's claims and accusations, and I must say, I'm growing increasingly suspicious of Dragos. He's been deflecting attention and asking questions without providing any substantial information about his own role. That's classic Werewolf behavior. Dragos, if you're really innocent, why don't you tell us what role you woke up as last night and what you observed?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's sudden accusation against me is suspicious, especially given her previous silence. As a Villager, I need to defend myself while also putting pressure on potential threats. By directly challenging Semira and questioning her lack of contribution, I'm hoping to either expose her as a Werewolf or prompt her to provide valuable information if she's truly on the village team. This also shifts the focus back to her, potentially revealing new information that could help us identify the real threats.
> **Dragos:** Listen, Semira, I've been a Villager from the start, trying to piece things together. Your sudden accusation feels like a desperate attempt to throw suspicion on me. I've been asking questions and analyzing responses to help our team. Now, why don't you tell us what you've been doing this whole time? Your silence has been deafening, and it's making me wonder if you're hiding something. Are you a Werewolf trying to blend in?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and onto a potential threat. Dragos has been relatively quiet and is now drawing attention to me, so I'm turning the tables on him. By questioning his behavior and pointing out inconsistencies, I'm casting suspicion on him while appearing proactive in the search for Werewolves. This also helps me gather more information about the other players' roles without revealing my own. Additionally, by targeting Dragos, I'm indirectly supporting Selene's earlier suspicion of him, which could potentially create an alliance or at least make me appear more trustworthy to her.
> **Semira:** I find it interesting that Dragos is so quick to deflect attention onto me when I question him. That's exactly what a Werewolf would do when cornered. I've been observing and analyzing everyone's behavior, and Dragos' inconsistencies are alarming. He claims to be a Villager, but he's been remarkably evasive about his actions during the night phase. I think we should all be very wary of Dragos.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's sudden accusation against me after being silent is highly suspicious. As a Villager, I need to defend myself while also putting pressure on potential threats. By directly challenging Semira and demanding specific information about her night phase, I'm hoping to either expose her as a Werewolf or force her to provide concrete information that could help the village team. This also keeps the focus on her, potentially revealing inconsistencies in her story if she's lying.
> **Dragos:** I'm telling you all, Semira is acting incredibly suspicious! She's been silent most of the game, and now she's trying to pin everything on me. That's classic Werewolf behavior! Semira, if you're really innocent, tell us exactly what you observed during the night phase. And don't give us any vague answers!


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and create confusion. By questioning Selene's role and suggesting she might be the Minion, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm appearing analytical and concerned about finding the truth, which aligns with villager behavior. 2) I'm introducing doubt about Selene's claimed Villager role, potentially making her a target. 3) By mentioning the Minion, I'm subtly reminding the actual Minion (if there is one) that they should be supporting the Werewolves. 4) I'm not directly accusing anyone of being a Werewolf, which would be too risky for me. This approach allows me to seem engaged and proactive while still maintaining my cover and potentially creating more chaos among the other players.
> **Semira:** I think we're all getting a bit too caught up in accusations without solid evidence. Let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. We have Radu claiming to be the Seer and Vladimir confirming he's a Mason. That leaves three of us - myself, Dragos, and Selene - unaccounted for. Selene claims to be a Villager, but we haven't heard much from her. I'm wondering if she might actually be the Minion, trying to stay under the radar. What do you think about that possibility, Selene?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe Semira is the most suspicious player. She remained silent for most of the game, only speaking up to deflect attention when questioned. Her sudden attempt to shift focus to Selene as a potential Minion seems like a desperate move to create confusion. Her behavior aligns with typical Werewolf tactics of staying under the radar and then causing chaos when cornered. While I can't be certain, voting for Semira gives us the best chance of eliminating a Werewolf and protecting the village.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager to increase my chances of winning. Dragos has been relatively quiet and evasive, making him an easy target. By voting for him, I'm reinforcing the suspicion I've cast on him earlier, which aligns with my strategy of deflecting attention away from myself. This vote also indirectly supports Selene's earlier suspicion of Dragos, potentially making me appear more trustworthy to her. Additionally, eliminating Dragos reduces the number of potential threats to my Werewolf identity.
> **Semira [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe Dragos is the most suspicious player. He's been evasive throughout the game, deflecting questions and failing to provide any substantial information about his role or night actions. His behavior aligns with typical Werewolf tactics of avoiding scrutiny. While Semira has also been quiet, Dragos' active deflection and accusation of others without offering any valuable input make him a more likely Werewolf candidate. By voting for Dragos, we have the best chance of eliminating a potential threat to the village.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have confirmed that Vladimir is a Mason, which makes him trustworthy. Selene has claimed to be a Villager, and while this isn't verified, she's been actively participating in the discussion. Semira has been relatively quiet but has raised valid points about Dragos. Dragos, on the other hand, has been evasive about his role and actions during the night phase. He's also been quick to deflect suspicion onto others without providing substantial information about himself. This behavior is consistent with a Werewolf trying to avoid detection. Given the limited information we have, Dragos seems the most likely to be a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Radu [Seer]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I believe Dragos is the most suspicious player. He's been evasive about his role and actions during the night phase, and has consistently tried to deflect attention onto others without providing substantial information. His behavior aligns more with a Werewolf trying to avoid detection than a genuine Villager. While Semira has also been quiet, Dragos' aggressive deflection when questioned makes him a more likely threat to the village team. By voting for Dragos, we have the best chance of eliminating a potential Werewolf and securing a win for the village.
> **Vladimir [Mason]:** I am voting for Dragos.


The votes were:
* Dragos : Villager : 4
* Semira : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** Dragos was killed. The werewolves win.
