## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Marius. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Andrei and Michael. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Larisa. They are thinking about their action.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards provides more information about the game state. There's a higher chance of finding a key role like a Werewolf or Minion in the center, which could help narrow down the possibilities among the players. Additionally, this knowledge can be used to bluff or validate others' claims later in the game. Checking a single player's card is riskier, as it might not yield as much useful information, especially if that player turns out to be a Villager.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to start gathering information about other players' roles. Marius hasn't said much, which could be suspicious. By directly asking him about his role, I might be able to gauge his reaction and determine if he's telling the truth. If he claims to be a Werewolf or Minion, that's valuable information. If he claims to be a Village-aligned role, I can compare that with what others say later.
> **Ileana:** Hey Marius, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. Claiming to be a Villager is a safe bet, as it's a common role and hard to disprove. By immediately turning the question back to Ileana, I'm both avoiding further scrutiny on myself and potentially gathering information about other players. If Ileana is the Seer, this might prompt her to reveal information that could be useful to me. If she's not, her response might still give me clues about her role or others' roles. Additionally, by questioning her motives for asking, I'm subtly casting a bit of suspicion on her, which could be beneficial for me in the long run.
> **Marius:** Oh, I woke up as a Villager last night. Nothing exciting happened on my end. But Ileana, you seem pretty eager to know about everyone's roles. What about you? Did anything interesting happen during your night phase?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius claiming to be a Villager doesn't give us much information, and his calmness could be a facade. By redirecting the question to Michael, I'm hoping to gather more information from another player. If Michael is the Seer, this gives him an opportunity to share information without directly revealing his role. If he's a Mason, he might give us a hint about the other Mason. And if he's a Werewolf or Minion, his response might reveal some inconsistencies. This approach allows me to indirectly challenge Marius's claim while potentially uncovering more useful information.
> **Ileana:** Interesting, Marius. You say you're a Villager, but you seem a bit too calm about it. Michael, did you notice anything unusual during the night phase? Did you see or hear anything that might help us identify the Werewolves?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, it's crucial to reveal this information early to establish trust and help the village team. By confirming Andrei's role, we eliminate two potential Werewolf suspects and can focus on the remaining players. This also indirectly puts pressure on the real Werewolves, as they now have fewer players to hide behind.
> **Michael:** Actually, I have some important information to share. Andrei and I are both Masons. We saw each other during the night phase. This means we can trust each other, and it narrows down our search for the Werewolves.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Michael's claim without seeming too aggressive. By questioning the convenience of their claim, I'm subtly suggesting that they might be lying. Directing the question to Larisa serves two purposes: it takes the focus off me and potentially reveals more information about Larisa's role. If Larisa is the Seer or the Minion, her response could be very informative. Additionally, by engaging others in the conversation, I appear more like a concerned Villager trying to solve the mystery rather than a Werewolf trying to hide.
> **Marius:** Wait a minute, Michael. That's quite a bold claim you're making there. If you and Andrei are both Masons, that means there's only one Werewolf among us, right? That seems a bit convenient. How do we know you're not just trying to gain our trust? Larisa, you've been quiet. What do you think about Michael's claim?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know that one Mason card is in the center, which contradicts Michael's claim. By asking for more details, I'm giving Michael a chance to either reveal more information that might expose him as a Werewolf or to potentially trip up in his story. This also allows me to gather more information without revealing my role as the Seer just yet.
> **Larisa:** Michael, I find your claim about being Masons with Andrei quite interesting. Can you tell us more about what you saw during the night phase? Did you notice anything else unusual?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** By redirecting the question back to Larisa, I'm attempting to put pressure on her and gather more information. Her silence and attempt to deflect attention could be signs of her being a Werewolf or the Minion. It's important to get her to reveal more about her role or actions during the night phase. This also helps to shift the focus away from my claim about being a Mason, which is true but might be seen as suspicious by others.
> **Michael:** Larisa, I appreciate your interest. During the night phase, I simply opened my eyes and saw Andrei as the other Mason. That's all there is to it. But I'm more curious about you now. You've been awfully quiet, and your question seems to be deflecting attention. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know for certain that one Mason card is in the center. This directly contradicts Michael's claim about him and Andrei both being Masons. By revealing my role and this information, I'm taking a risk, but it's crucial to expose this lie early. This also puts pressure on Michael to explain himself, potentially revealing more information about his true role. Additionally, it indirectly challenges Andrei, as he hasn't spoken up to confirm or deny Michael's claim about them both being Masons.
> **Larisa:** Michael, I'm afraid I have to challenge your claim. As the Seer, I looked at two center cards last night, and one of them was a Mason. This means you and Andrei can't both be Masons. One of you is lying, and I suspect you might be a Werewolf trying to gain our trust.


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claim of being the Seer and seeing a Mason card in the center puts me in a difficult position. Since I know I'm actually a Mason, this means Andrei must be lying. By admitting to my own deception (which isn't actually true), I'm trying to build credibility with Larisa and the others while simultaneously putting pressure on Andrei. This move could expose Andrei if he's actually a Werewolf or force him to reveal his true role if he's not a Mason. It's a risky play, but it might help us identify the Werewolf faster.
> **Michael:** Larisa, that's a shocking accusation! But if you're truly the Seer, then you've just caught me in a lie. I apologize to everyone, I'm not actually a Mason. I was trying to protect the real Mason by claiming this role. Now, the question is, who's the real Mason? Andrei, care to explain yourself?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to call out Michael's lie immediately to maintain my credibility as the real Mason. By confronting him directly, I can potentially expose a Werewolf or at least create doubt about his intentions. This also aligns with Larisa's claim of being the Seer, which adds credibility to my accusation. By questioning Michael's motives, I'm hoping to pressure him into revealing more information or making a mistake that could help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Michael, I can't believe you'd try to deceive us like this! As the real Mason, I can confirm that you are definitely not my partner. Your lie puts you in a very suspicious position. Why would you claim to be a Mason if you're not? Are you trying to cover for someone else, or are you a Werewolf yourself?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** By shifting the focus to Ileana, I'm attempting to deflect suspicion from myself while also potentially uncovering more information. Ileana has been asking pointed questions from the beginning, which could be a sign of the Minion trying to gather intel for the Werewolves. This move also buys me time to reassess the situation and observe how others react to this new accusation. If Ileana is indeed the Minion or a Werewolf, this might pressure her into revealing more information or making a mistake.
> **Michael:** Andrei, I understand your anger, but let's think about this logically. If I were a Werewolf, why would I claim to be a Mason and then immediately back down when challenged? That doesn't make sense. I think we need to look at who's been quiet and who's been pushing narratives. Ileana, you've been awfully inquisitive from the start. Are you perhaps the Minion, trying to gather information for the Werewolves?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's behavior has been highly suspicious. He initially lied about being a Mason, then quickly backtracked when challenged by Larisa, who claims to be the Seer. Now he's trying to deflect suspicion onto me, a Villager who's been actively trying to uncover the truth. His actions align more with a Werewolf trying to create chaos and misdirect the village than with any village-aligned role. By calling him out directly, I'm hoping to pressure him into revealing more information or making a mistake that could confirm his Werewolf status.
> **Ileana:** Michael, your sudden confession and attempt to shift suspicion onto me is very telling. As a Villager, I've been asking questions to gather information and find the Werewolves. Your lie about being a Mason and now trying to paint me as the Minion makes you my prime suspect. Everyone, I think we should focus on Michael as a potential Werewolf.


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** By addressing Ileana's accusation and then quickly shifting focus to Larisa, I'm attempting to deflect suspicion while also gathering more information. If Larisa is truly the Seer, her answer could provide valuable insight. If she hesitates or gives an inconsistent answer, it might reveal her as a potential Werewolf or Minion. This also puts pressure on Larisa to provide more details, which could help the village team identify the Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Ileana, I understand your suspicion, but let's think about this logically. If I were a Werewolf, why would I make such a risky move? Larisa, you claimed to be the Seer and saw a Mason card in the center. Can you tell us what the other card you saw was? This information could be crucial in identifying the Werewolf.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By redirecting the focus back to Michael's initial lie, I'm maintaining pressure on him without revealing too much information. This keeps the suspicion on him while also potentially uncovering more about his motivations and true role. Additionally, by not revealing the Minion card, I'm keeping that information to myself, which could be useful later in the game or to catch someone in a lie if they claim to be the Minion.
> **Larisa:** Michael, I appreciate your curiosity, but I'm not comfortable revealing the other center card I saw. That information could be dangerous in the wrong hands. Instead, I'd like to know why you initially lied about being a Mason. What were you trying to achieve?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** By challenging Larisa's refusal to share information and questioning her motives, I'm attempting to put pressure on her and potentially expose her as the Werewolf. If she's truly the Seer, she should be more willing to share information to help the village team. Her reluctance could be a sign that she's hiding something. This move also shifts the focus away from me and onto Larisa, potentially rallying other players against her if they share my suspicions.
> **Michael:** Larisa, I understand your reluctance to reveal the other center card, but your refusal to share this crucial information is highly suspicious. As for my initial lie, I was trying to protect someone I thought was the real Mason. But now, I'm starting to think you might be the Werewolf trying to manipulate us all. Your claim of being the Seer seems convenient, and your unwillingness to share information doesn't align with the village team's goals. What do you say to that?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's initial lie about being a Mason, followed by his attempt to shift suspicion onto me when caught, is highly suspicious. By firmly defending my position as the Seer and pointing out Michael's inconsistent behavior, I aim to solidify the group's trust in me while keeping the focus on Michael as the primary suspect. This approach also indirectly encourages other players, especially Andrei (the claimed real Mason), to speak up and provide more information.
> **Larisa:** Michael, your accusation is baseless and desperate. As the Seer, I've provided crucial information that exposed your lie. The fact that you're now trying to cast suspicion on me shows you're grasping at straws. Everyone, I believe Michael is likely the Werewolf or possibly the Minion. His actions have been consistently deceptive and manipulative.


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly challenging Larisa's credibility in front of everyone, I'm attempting to rally the other players against her. Her refusal to share information about the second center card is highly suspicious for someone claiming to be the Seer. If she's truly on the village team, she should be more forthcoming. This move also serves to deflect attention from my earlier lie and reframe the narrative around Larisa's suspicious behavior. If Larisa is indeed the Werewolf or Minion, this pressure might cause her to make a mistake or reveal inconsistencies in her story.
> **Michael:** Everyone, I think we need to focus on Larisa. Her claim of being the Seer is becoming less credible by the minute. She refuses to share crucial information that could help us identify the Werewolf. Why would a true Seer withhold information that could save the village?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Andrei, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm reinforcing Andrei's claim as the real Mason, which aligns with what I know from my Seer ability. 2) I'm encouraging Andrei to speak up and potentially provide more information or insights. 3) I'm keeping the focus on Michael's suspicious behavior while also giving another player a chance to voice their opinion. This approach maintains pressure on Michael while also gathering more information from other players.
> **Larisa:** Michael, your desperate attempts to discredit me are only making you look more suspicious. A true villager would be grateful for the information I've provided. Instead, you're trying to turn everyone against the one person who has given concrete evidence. This behavior is exactly what we'd expect from a Werewolf trying to sow discord. Andrei, as the real Mason, what's your take on Michael's behavior?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As the real Mason, I need to reinforce Larisa's credibility since her Seer claim aligns with my knowledge of being the only Mason awake. By supporting her and further exposing Michael's deception, I'm hoping to unite the village against a likely Werewolf. This also helps establish my own credibility and trustworthiness, which is crucial for the village team's success.
> **Andrei:** I agree with Larisa. Michael's behavior has been extremely suspicious from the start. First, he lied about being a Mason, and now he's desperately trying to discredit Larisa, who has provided valuable information. This is classic Werewolf tactics - create confusion and doubt to survive. I think we should seriously consider voting for Michael.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As the real Mason, I need to reinforce the credibility of Larisa's Seer claim, which aligns with my knowledge of being the only Mason awake. By strongly advocating for Michael's elimination, I'm attempting to unite the village against a likely Werewolf. This also helps establish my own trustworthiness and leadership within the group, which is crucial for the village team's success. Additionally, by making a clear and decisive statement, I'm hoping to influence the other players' opinions and potentially sway the vote in our favor.
> **Andrei:** Everyone, I think we need to focus on Michael. His actions have been consistently deceptive and harmful to the village. He lied about being a Mason, then tried to discredit Larisa when she exposed him. This behavior is textbook Werewolf tactics. I believe we should strongly consider voting for Michael in the upcoming vote.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe Michael is the most likely Werewolf based on the information we have. He initially lied about being a Mason, then quickly backtracked when challenged by Larisa, who claims to be the Seer. His attempts to deflect suspicion onto others, particularly Larisa who provided valuable information, are typical Werewolf tactics. His behavior has been consistently deceptive and manipulative throughout the game. While there's still some uncertainty, voting for Michael seems to be the best chance to eliminate a Werewolf and protect the village.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to blend in with the villagers and eliminate potential threats. Michael has been the center of attention and suspicion, making him an easy target. By voting for Michael, I appear to be siding with the majority and acting in the village's interest, which helps maintain my cover. Additionally, eliminating Michael removes a player who has been actively engaged in discussions and could potentially uncover my true identity. This vote allows me to contribute to the group's apparent consensus while furthering my goal as a Werewolf.
> **Marius [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As the real Mason, I'm confident that Michael is lying about his role. His initial deception about being a Mason and subsequent attempts to discredit Larisa, who corroborated my role with her Seer claim, strongly suggest he's a Werewolf. Voting for Michael is the best way to protect the village and eliminate a potential threat.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Despite the accusations against me, I still believe Larisa is the most suspicious player. Her claim of being the Seer is questionable, especially given her refusal to share information about the second center card she allegedly saw. This behavior is inconsistent with a true Seer who should be helping the village. Additionally, her quick accusation against me when I questioned her motives seems like a deflection tactic. While I understand I've made myself a target with my earlier deception, I believe voting for Larisa gives us the best chance of eliminating the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Michael [Mason]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have concrete evidence that Michael lied about being a Mason. His subsequent attempts to discredit me and sow discord align with typical Werewolf behavior. His actions have been consistently deceptive, from the initial false claim to his desperate attempts to shift suspicion. Andrei's confirmation as the real Mason further supports this. Voting for Michael is the most logical choice to protect the village.
> **Larisa [Seer]:** I am voting for Michael.


The votes were:
* Michael : Mason : 4
* Larisa : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The werewolves win.
