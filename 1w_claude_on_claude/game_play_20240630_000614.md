## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Selene. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Ileana. They are thinking about their action.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards provides more information overall. There's a higher chance of finding a significant role (like Werewolf or Minion) in the center, which could help narrow down the possibilities for the other players. If I find a Werewolf card in the center, it means there's only one Werewolf among the players, making it easier to identify them. Additionally, knowing what's in the center can help me validate or invalidate other players' claims later in the game, giving me a strategic advantage during discussions.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I saw both Mason cards in the center during the night phase. Revealing this information early can help the village team start deducing the roles of other players. It eliminates the possibility of anyone truthfully claiming to be a Mason, which could help identify potential Werewolves or the Minion if they try to falsely claim this role. Additionally, this information might prompt other players to share what they know, potentially exposing inconsistencies in the Werewolves' or Minion's claims.
> **Ileana:** I have some interesting information to share. Both Mason cards are in the center, which means none of us are Masons. This narrows down our possibilities significantly.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to verify the information we're getting. Ileana's claim about the Mason cards is significant, but it's also suspicious. If she's telling the truth, she must be the Seer, which would be great for us villagers. However, if she's lying, she could be a Werewolf trying to mislead us. By questioning her directly, I hope to get more information and possibly catch her in a lie if she's not being truthful.
> **Larisa:** Ileana, that's quite a bold claim. How can you be so sure that both Mason cards are in the center? Did you see them yourself?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly confirming my role as the Seer and explaining how I obtained this information, I'm establishing credibility and providing valuable information to the village team. This puts pressure on the Werewolves and Minion, as they now know that I have accurate information about the game state. It also invites other players to share their roles or question my claim, which could help us identify the Werewolves faster.
> **Ileana:** Yes, Larisa, I can be certain because I am the Seer. I chose to look at two center cards during the night phase, and both were Mason cards. This information is crucial for our village team.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana claims to be the Seer, which is crucial information for us villagers. However, we need to gather more information from other players to verify or challenge this claim. Selene hasn't spoken yet, so targeting her with a direct question serves two purposes: 1) It puts pressure on her to reveal information about her role, which could help us identify potential werewolves or confirm Ileana's story. 2) If Selene is a werewolf, she might struggle to come up with a convincing lie on the spot. As a villager, I need to be proactive in uncovering the truth and identifying potential threats to the village.
> **Larisa:** Selene, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast doubt on Ileana's Seer claim without directly accusing her. By presenting myself as a Villager and questioning her information, I'm trying to sow seeds of doubt in the group. This could lead to mistrust and potentially divert attention away from me. Additionally, by mentioning that there might be more than one Werewolf, I'm indirectly protecting myself and leaving room for doubt about the game's setup.
> **Selene:** I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with Ileana's claim. As a Villager, I didn't wake up during the night, but something about her story doesn't add up. If she really saw two Mason cards in the center, that means there's only one Werewolf among us. That seems too convenient, doesn't it?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing a question to Lucian, who has been quiet, I'm attempting to shift the focus away from myself and onto another player. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear engaged and interested in uncovering the truth, which is how a Villager might act. It also puts pressure on Lucian to speak up, potentially revealing information that could be useful to me as a Werewolf. Additionally, by subtly questioning Ileana's claim without directly accusing her, I'm trying to plant seeds of doubt about her role as the Seer. If others start to doubt Ileana, it could lead to her being voted out, which would be beneficial for me as a Werewolf.
> **Selene:** I've been thinking about what Ileana said, and I'm not entirely convinced. Lucian, you've been quiet so far. What do you think about Ileana's claim of being the Seer? Do you find it believable, or do you have any doubts?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to be cautious of potential Werewolves. Ileana's claim of being the Seer and revealing crucial information so early seems risky and potentially deceptive. By questioning her motives, I hope to gauge her reaction and see if her story holds up under scrutiny. If she's telling the truth, she's an ally, but if she's lying, she could be a Werewolf trying to manipulate the group.
> **Lucian:** Ileana, I find your claim about being the Seer quite suspicious. If you really saw two Mason cards in the center, why would you reveal that information so quickly? It seems like you're trying to gain our trust, but it might be a ploy to divert attention from yourself. Can you explain your reasoning for sharing this information so early in the game?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Lucian's concerns directly and explaining my reasoning, I'm reinforcing my credibility as the Seer. Turning the question back to Lucian puts him on the spot and may reveal inconsistencies in his story if he's a Werewolf or Minion. His response could provide valuable information to the group and help us identify potential threats.
> **Ileana:** Lucian, I understand your skepticism, but as the Seer, I felt it was crucial to share this information early. Knowing that both Mason cards are in the center eliminates potential false claims and narrows down our search for the Werewolves. I'm not trying to divert attention; I'm trying to give the village team a strategic advantage. Now, let me ask you this: What role did you wake up as last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm responding to Ileana's direct question about my role while maintaining my suspicion of her claim. By asking why she didn't look at player cards, I'm trying to poke holes in her story. If she's truly the Seer, she should have a good explanation for her choices. If she stumbles or gives an unconvincing answer, it might indicate that she's lying about being the Seer and could potentially be a Werewolf trying to mislead the group.
> **Lucian:** I woke up as a Villager, Ileana. I didn't have any night actions. Now, let me ask you this: if you're really the Seer, why didn't you look at any player cards? That could have given us more concrete information about potential Werewolves.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's response seems evasive. He's questioning my decision as the Seer without providing much information about his own role or actions. By asking him about his choice to look at player cards, I'm subtly pointing out an inconsistency in his story - he claimed to be a Villager earlier, which doesn't have a night action. This question might force him to reveal more information or potentially contradict himself, which could help us identify if he's actually a Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive the group.
> **Ileana:** Lucian, I find it interesting that you chose to look at player cards instead of center cards. That's a valid strategy, but it doesn't give us as much information about the overall game state. Can you tell us why you made that choice?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's response contains a critical error - she misinterpreted my previous statement about being a Villager. This could be a sign that she's lying and struggling to keep her story straight. By pointing out this mistake and questioning her claim again, I'm putting pressure on her to see how she reacts. If she's a Werewolf, this might cause her to slip up further. Additionally, this helps me maintain my credibility with the other players by immediately correcting the false assumption about my role.
> **Lucian:** Wait a minute, Ileana. I never said I looked at player cards. I think you're trying to twist my words. I clearly stated that I'm a Villager and didn't have any night actions. This makes me even more suspicious of you. Are you sure you're really the Seer, or are you just trying to confuse us?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to address my mistake with Lucian to maintain credibility. By redirecting the conversation to Cristina, who has been quiet, we can gather more information. This also takes the pressure off me and allows us to hear from another player who might provide valuable insights or potentially reveal inconsistencies if they're a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Ileana:** I apologize for the confusion, Lucian. You're right, I misinterpreted your previous statement. Let me rephrase: As the Seer, I chose to look at center cards because it gives us more information about the overall game state. Now, given that you're a Villager, Cristina has been quiet. Cristina, what role did you wake up as last night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to verify Ileana's claim of being the Seer. Her information is crucial, but it also paints a risky picture for the village. By questioning her decision, I might get more insight into her reasoning or potentially expose inconsistencies if she's lying. This could help identify if she's truly the Seer or possibly a Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Cristina:** Ileana, I find your claim about being the Seer quite intriguing, but I'm a bit concerned. If you really saw two Mason cards in the center, that means we have a Werewolf, a Minion, and a Seer among us five players. That's a dangerous situation for the village. Can you tell us why you chose to look at the center cards instead of a player's card?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** I'm addressing Cristina's concern while reaffirming my role as the Seer and my reasoning for looking at center cards. By redirecting the question back to Cristina and pressing for her role, I'm trying to gather more information from a player who has been relatively quiet. This could potentially reveal inconsistencies in her story if she's a Werewolf or Minion, or confirm another villager if she's telling the truth. It's crucial to get all players to reveal their supposed roles to help the village team deduce who might be lying.
> **Ileana:** Cristina, I appreciate your concern. As the Seer, I chose to look at center cards because it gives us more information about the overall game state. Knowing that both Mason cards are in the center eliminates potential false claims and narrows down our search for the Werewolves. Now, you still haven't answered my question. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** By answering Ileana's question directly, I'm being transparent about my role as a Villager. This should help build trust with the group. Now, I'm directing attention to Larisa, who initially questioned Ileana's claim. By asking for Larisa's current opinion, I'm trying to gauge if there's any inconsistency in her stance or if she has additional insights. This could help us identify potential Werewolves or allies.
> **Cristina:** I woke up as a Villager last night, Ileana. I didn't have any special actions. Now, I have a question for Larisa. You seemed skeptical of Ileana's claim earlier. What's your take on the situation now? Do you think Ileana is telling the truth about being the Seer?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify the Werewolves quickly. Ileana's behavior has been inconsistent, and Lucian caught her in a potential lie. By directing this question to Lucian, I'm hoping to gather more evidence against Ileana if she is indeed a Werewolf. If Lucian agrees, it could build a stronger case against her. If he disagrees, it might reveal more information about his own role or thoughts on the game situation.
> **Larisa:** I've been listening carefully to everyone, and I'm starting to get suspicious of Ileana. Her claim of being the Seer seemed bold at first, but now it feels like she's trying too hard to control the narrative. Lucian, you caught her in a contradiction earlier. What do you think? Could Ileana actually be a Werewolf trying to mislead us?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** By agreeing with Larisa's suspicions and recalling Ileana's earlier mistake, I'm reinforcing the idea that Ileana might be lying. Directing this to Larisa, who has already expressed doubt, could help build a consensus against Ileana. If Ileana is indeed a Werewolf, getting others to focus on her increases our chances of winning. Additionally, by asking Larisa for her opinion on what to do next, I'm encouraging more discussion that might reveal additional information or inconsistencies.
> **Lucian:** Larisa, I completely agree with your suspicions about Ileana. Her slip-up earlier when she misinterpreted my role is a huge red flag. I think we should seriously consider the possibility that Ileana is a Werewolf trying to manipulate us by falsely claiming to be the Seer. What do you think we should do about this?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm targeting Selene because she was the first to express doubt about Ileana's claim. By asking her opinion directly, I'm hoping to build a consensus against Ileana if she is indeed a Werewolf. Additionally, Selene's response might reveal more about her own role or thoughts on the game situation. As a Villager, it's crucial to identify potential threats quickly, and Ileana's inconsistent behavior makes her the prime suspect right now.
> **Larisa:** I think we need to focus on Ileana. Her story about being the Seer doesn't add up, and she's made some suspicious mistakes. What if she's actually a Werewolf trying to throw us off?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and Ileana, who's under suspicion. By questioning Larisa, I'm attempting to shift the focus to a new target. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear as a vigilant Villager, creates doubt about Larisa, and potentially divides the group's attention. If Larisa is indeed a Villager or Seer, putting her under scrutiny could benefit the Werewolf team. Additionally, by mentioning that a Werewolf could be quietly observing, I'm subtly reminding others that the threat could come from anywhere, not just the most vocal players.
> **Selene:** I think we're getting sidetracked here. While Ileana's claim is suspicious, we can't ignore the fact that there could be a Werewolf quietly observing our debate. Larisa, you've been quick to shift focus onto Ileana, but what about your own role? You haven't shared much about what you did during the night phase. Care to enlighten us?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's sudden accusation towards me feels like a deflection tactic. As a Villager, I need to maintain my innocence while keeping the focus on potential Werewolves. By addressing Selene's concern and then quickly shifting attention to Cristina, who has been quiet, I'm hoping to gather more information and potentially expose any inconsistencies in other players' stories. This also serves to show that I'm willing to consider all possibilities, not just fixating on Ileana, which could help build trust with other players.
> **Larisa:** Look, I understand your suspicion, Selene, but I've been transparent from the start. I'm a Villager, plain and simple. I didn't wake up during the night because Villagers don't have any night actions. My focus on Ileana is because her story has more holes than Swiss cheese. But you're right, we can't ignore other possibilities. Cristina has been awfully quiet. Cristina, what's your take on all this? Do you think Ileana could be a Werewolf, or do you have suspicions about someone else?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I'm confident in my role and the information I provided about the Mason cards. Larisa has been particularly aggressive in questioning my claims without offering much information about her own role. Her quick shift to accusing me of being a Werewolf seems like a deflection tactic. Given that we know there's at least one Werewolf among us, Larisa's behavior is the most suspicious. By voting for her, we have the best chance of eliminating a potential threat to the village team.
> **Ileana [Seer]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe Ileana is the most suspicious player. Her claim of being the Seer has been inconsistent and full of contradictions. She made a significant mistake when interpreting Lucian's role, which a true Seer likely wouldn't do. Her insistence on controlling the narrative and pushing for information from others while providing questionable information herself raises red flags. While there's a chance she could be the Minion trying to create chaos, voting for her seems the safest bet to potentially eliminate a Werewolf or at least a threat to the village team.
> **Larisa [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention from myself and eliminate potential threats. Ileana's claim of being the Seer makes her a significant threat to the Werewolf team. By voting for her, I'm aligning myself with the growing suspicion against her, which helps maintain my cover as a potential Villager. Additionally, eliminating the claimed Seer (whether true or not) will benefit the Werewolf team by removing a powerful role or exposing a liar, both of which create more confusion and mistrust among the remaining players.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe voting for Ileana is our best chance to eliminate a potential Werewolf. Her claim of being the Seer has been inconsistent and suspicious throughout the game. She made a significant error when she misinterpreted my role, which a true Seer likely wouldn't do. Additionally, her insistence on revealing crucial information early in the game seems like a ploy to gain trust quickly. While there's a chance she could be telling the truth, the risk of her being a Werewolf is too high to ignore. By voting for Ileana, we have the best chance of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Ileana's claim of being the Seer the most suspicious. Her story about seeing two Mason cards in the center doesn't add up, and she made a significant mistake when interpreting Lucian's role. This inconsistency suggests she might be a Werewolf trying to mislead the village. While there's a chance she could be the real Seer, the risk of letting a potential Werewolf survive is too great. By voting for Ileana, we have the best chance of eliminating a Werewolf and securing a win for the village team.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


The votes were:
* Ileana : Seer : 4
* Larisa : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Ileana was killed. The werewolves win.
