## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Mircea. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Lucian. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Marius. They are thinking about their action.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards provides more information about the game state. There's a higher chance of finding a crucial role like a Werewolf or Minion in the center, which could help narrow down the possibilities for the other players' roles. Additionally, this knowledge can be used to create a more convincing narrative during the day phase, potentially misleading the Werewolves if they exist among the players.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By accusing Viktor, who I know isn't the other Werewolf (since that card is in the center), I'm creating a distraction and potentially setting up a target for elimination. This also makes me appear proactive and concerned about finding the Werewolves, which is how a Villager might act. Additionally, by asking for others' opinions, I'm encouraging discussion that doesn't involve scrutinizing my own actions.
> **Mircea:** I'm starting to get really suspicious of Viktor. He's been awfully quiet and hasn't contributed much to our discussions. That's exactly the kind of behavior I'd expect from a Werewolf trying to lay low. What do you all think about Viktor?


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, it's crucial to share this information with the group. Revealing that the Minion is in play puts pressure on the Werewolves and their potential ally. It also helps narrow down the possibilities for the remaining roles. By mentioning the Mason card, I'm indirectly suggesting that there's only one Mason in play, which could help identify potential allies. This information should spark discussion and help us identify suspicious behavior.
> **Marius:** I have some important information to share. I looked at two center cards during the night, and I saw a Mason and a Minion card there. This means there's only one Mason among us, and the Minion is definitely in play. We need to be very careful about who we trust.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius claims to have seen two center cards, which is an ability of the Seer. However, as a Villager, I know I'm not a Werewolf, so I'm suspicious of anyone claiming to have special knowledge. If Marius is lying about being the Seer, he could be a Werewolf trying to create confusion. By questioning him directly, I hope to either expose a lie or confirm his role as Seer, which would be valuable information for the village team.
> **Viktor:** Marius, I find your claim about seeing the center cards very suspicious. How can you be so sure about what you saw? Are you really the Seer, or are you trying to mislead us?


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor's immediate challenge to my claim is suspicious. As the Seer, I need to defend my position and the valuable information I've provided. By questioning Viktor's motives, I'm putting pressure on him to explain his skepticism, which might reveal more about his own role. If he's a Werewolf, he might be trying to discredit me to protect himself. This also encourages other players to consider Viktor's behavior more closely.
> **Marius:** Viktor, I understand your skepticism, but I can assure you that I am indeed the Seer. My role allows me to look at two center cards, which is exactly what I did. Why are you so quick to doubt me? Are you perhaps trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm continuing to press Marius because his claim of being the Seer is crucial to our game. If he's telling the truth, his information is valuable, but if he's lying, he's likely a Werewolf trying to mislead us. By asking for more details about his decision-making process, I'm hoping to either catch him in a lie or confirm his story. This also shows the other players that I'm actively trying to uncover the truth, which could help dispel Mircea's earlier suspicions about me.
> **Viktor:** Marius, I appreciate your explanation, but I'm still not entirely convinced. If you're really the Seer, can you tell us why you chose to look at the center cards instead of a player's card? That seems like an unusual choice when we're trying to identify Werewolves.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor's continued doubt of my Seer claim is highly suspicious. By directly challenging him to explain his role and motives, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal more information. If he's a Werewolf, he might struggle to provide a convincing explanation. This also encourages other players to scrutinize Viktor's behavior more closely. By maintaining my stance as the Seer and pushing back against his doubts, I'm reinforcing my credibility while potentially exposing a Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Viktor, your skepticism about my role as the Seer is quite interesting. Can you explain why you're so eager to discredit the valuable information I've provided? What's your role in all of this?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm continuing to engage with Marius, but shifting the focus slightly. By asking about his suspicions regarding the Mason, I'm trying to gather more information while also showing that I'm considering the implications of his claim. This approach allows me to maintain pressure on Marius without appearing too aggressive, which might make others suspicious of me. Additionally, by openly stating that I'm a Villager, I'm being transparent about my role, which could help build trust with the other players. If Marius is indeed the Seer, his answer about the Mason could provide valuable information. If he's lying, his response might reveal inconsistencies in his story.
> **Viktor:** Marius, I'm not trying to discredit you, I'm just trying to understand the situation better. As for my role, I'm a Villager, and I'm doing my best to figure out who we can trust. Now, let me ask you this: if there's only one Mason among us as you claim, do you have any suspicions about who it might be?


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor's continued skepticism towards my Seer claim, despite my explanations, is highly suspicious. By directly challenging his motives and his claimed Villager role, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal more information or potentially slip up. This also serves to reinforce my position as the Seer and the validity of the information I've provided. If Viktor is indeed a Werewolf, he might struggle to provide a convincing defense, which could expose him to the group. Additionally, by pointing out his focus on discrediting me, I'm encouraging other players to consider why Viktor might be so invested in undermining the Seer's information.
> **Marius:** Viktor, your insistence on questioning my role as the Seer is becoming more and more suspicious. If you're really a Villager as you claim, why are you so focused on discrediting the only solid information we have? It almost seems like you're trying to protect someone... perhaps yourself?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm shifting the focus away from myself and onto other players who haven't contributed much to the discussion. By asking Lucian and Ileana for their opinions, I'm trying to gather more information and see how they react to Marius's claim. This could potentially reveal new insights or inconsistencies. Additionally, by mentioning that questioning is what a Villager should do, I'm reinforcing my claimed role without directly stating it again.
> **Viktor:** Marius, I find it interesting that you're now trying to deflect suspicion onto me. I've been asking questions to understand the situation better, which is exactly what a Villager should do. Now, let's focus on something else. Lucian and Ileana have been awfully quiet. What do you two think about Marius's claim of being the Seer?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know there's another Mason card in the center, which partially corroborates Marius's claim about seeing a Mason card there. This lends some credibility to his Seer claim. Viktor's aggressive questioning of Marius seems suspiciously like an attempt to discredit valuable information. Given that we know the Minion is in play (based on Marius's information), it's possible Viktor is the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves by casting doubt on the Seer's revelations. By directly questioning Viktor, I hope to put pressure on him and see how he reacts, which could give us more information about his true role.
> **Lucian:** I've been quiet because I've been carefully observing everyone's behavior. Marius, your claim about being the Seer is quite bold, but it aligns with some information I have. However, Viktor's persistent questioning is raising some red flags for me. Viktor, are you perhaps the Minion trying to sow discord and protect the Werewolves?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** By addressing Lucian's accusation and asking for more details about his information, I'm accomplishing several things. First, I'm defending myself against the Minion accusation, which could help maintain my credibility. Second, I'm showing that I'm still actively engaged in uncovering the truth, which is consistent with my Villager role. Most importantly, I'm trying to get more information from Lucian. If he has information that corroborates Marius's claim, it could be crucial for identifying the Werewolves. However, if Lucian is unable to provide convincing details, it might suggest that he and Marius are working together as Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Lucian, I appreciate your observation, but I assure you I'm not the Minion. I've been questioning Marius because, as a Villager, I want to be absolutely certain about the information we're using to make our decision. But you mentioned you have some information that aligns with Marius's claim. Can you elaborate on that? What exactly do you know?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly confronting Viktor and revealing part of my information as a Mason, I'm hoping to put pressure on him and see how he reacts. This could potentially expose him if he's the Minion or a Werewolf. At the same time, I'm lending credibility to Marius's claim about being the Seer, which could help unite the village team against the werewolves. By asking Viktor about his motives, I'm also inviting the other players to scrutinize his behavior more closely.
> **Lucian:** Viktor, your persistent questioning of Marius and now your sudden interest in my information seem very suspicious. Are you trying to gather intel to protect yourself or someone else? As a Mason, I can confirm that there is indeed a Mason card in the center, which supports Marius's claim. Why are you so adamant about discrediting him?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's claim of being a Mason adds a new layer to our investigation. If he's telling the truth, it corroborates Marius's story about seeing a Mason card in the center. However, I'm still wary of fully trusting either of them without more information. By asking Lucian about the other Mason, I'm trying to see if he has any additional insights that could help us identify potential Werewolves. At the same time, I'm bringing Ileana into the conversation. Her silence so far is suspicious, and getting her to speak might reveal important information or inconsistencies. This approach allows me to gather more data while maintaining my stance as a Villager trying to uncover the truth.
> **Viktor:** Lucian, your claim about being a Mason is very interesting. If that's true, it does support Marius's story. But I'm curious, who do you think the other Mason might be? And Ileana, you've been awfully quiet. What's your take on all of this?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana has been silent throughout the discussion, which is unusual and potentially suspicious. By directly questioning her, I'm hoping to get her to reveal some information about her role or her thoughts on the situation. This could help us identify if she's a Werewolf or the Minion. Additionally, by mentioning the information Marius and I have shared, I'm reinforcing the alliance between us and putting more pressure on Viktor and Ileana, who seem to be the most suspicious at this point.
> **Lucian:** Ileana, you've been suspiciously quiet this entire time. What's your role, and what do you think about the information Marius and I have shared?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, it's crucial to identify potential threats. Viktor's behavior of constantly questioning Marius, who claims to be the Seer, is suspicious. If Marius is indeed the Seer, he's a valuable ally for the village team. By directing a question at Viktor, I'm hoping to put pressure on him and see how he reacts, which might reveal more about his true intentions or role.
> **Ileana:** I've been quiet because I've been carefully observing everyone's interactions. Marius and Lucian's claims seem to align, which gives them some credibility. However, Viktor's persistent questioning is making me suspicious. Viktor, why are you so determined to discredit Marius? Are you perhaps trying to protect yourself or another Werewolf?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's accusation needs to be addressed, but I also need to shift focus onto her lack of participation. By asking about her role and insights, I'm trying to gather more information while deflecting suspicion from myself. This approach allows me to maintain my stance as a Villager seeking the truth while potentially uncovering valuable information about Ileana's role or possible alliance with other players.
> **Viktor:** Ileana, I understand your suspicion, but I assure you I'm not a Werewolf. I've been questioning Marius because, as a Villager, it's my duty to verify information that could be crucial to our survival. Now, you've been quiet for most of the game. What's your role, and what insights can you offer us?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, it's crucial to identify potential threats. Viktor's behavior of constantly questioning Marius, who claims to be the Seer, is very suspicious. If Marius is indeed the Seer, he's a valuable ally for the village team. By directing this question at Viktor, I'm hoping to put pressure on him and see how he reacts, which might reveal more about his true intentions or role. This also aligns with Lucian's suspicion of Viktor, potentially indicating a pattern of behavior that could suggest Viktor is a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Ileana:** I'm becoming increasingly suspicious of Viktor. His constant questioning of Marius, who claims to be our Seer, seems like a deliberate attempt to undermine valuable information. Viktor, if you're really a Villager as you claim, why are you so focused on discrediting Marius instead of helping us identify the Werewolves?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's accusation against me needs to be addressed, but I also need to put pressure on her to reveal more information. By directly asking about her role and observations, I'm trying to gather crucial information while also deflecting suspicion from myself. If she's hesitant to answer or provides inconsistent information, it could suggest she's hiding something. This approach allows me to maintain my stance as a Villager seeking the truth while potentially uncovering valuable information about Ileana's role or possible alliance with other players. It's important to keep the focus on identifying the Werewolves, and Ileana's lack of contribution so far makes her a prime suspect.
> **Viktor:** Ileana, I find it suspicious that you're trying to shift focus onto me without revealing any information about yourself. What's your role, and what have you observed that makes you think I might be a Werewolf?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's behavior has been consistently suspicious throughout the game. He's been questioning Marius (the claimed Seer) aggressively and now he's trying to deflect attention onto me. As a Villager, it's crucial to identify potential threats, and Viktor's actions align with what we might expect from a Werewolf or Minion trying to create chaos and distrust. By directly challenging him to provide useful information, I'm hoping to either expose his lack of helpful input or force him to reveal something that might contradict his previous statements.
> **Ileana:** Viktor, your defensiveness and constant deflection are extremely suspicious. You keep asking others about their roles without providing any substantial information yourself. If you're truly a Villager, why don't you share what you've observed or any hunches you have about who the Werewolves might be?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana has been consistently avoiding revealing her role or providing any substantial information. Her sudden accusation against me without offering any insights of her own is highly suspicious. By directly accusing her of potentially being the Minion, I'm putting pressure on her to reveal more information. If she is indeed the Minion, this accusation might cause her to slip up or reveal inconsistencies in her story. Additionally, by mentioning the Minion role, I'm reminding the other players of this dangerous possibility, which could help unite the Village team against the Werewolf team. This approach allows me to defend myself while keeping the focus on identifying potential threats to the Village.
> **Viktor:** Ileana, I've been open about my role as a Villager from the start. My questioning isn't defensiveness, it's an attempt to uncover the truth. Now, let's focus on you. You've been quiet and evasive. Are you perhaps the Minion, trying to protect the Werewolves by casting suspicion on me?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion and eliminate a villager. Viktor has been the most vocal in questioning others, particularly Marius who claims to be the Seer. By voting for Viktor, I'm supporting the suspicions raised by others, which makes me appear to be on the village team. This also helps eliminate a potential threat to my identity as a Werewolf. Furthermore, voting for Viktor aligns with the suspicions raised by Lucian and Ileana, which helps me blend in with the village team while furthering my goal of eliminating a villager.
> **Mircea [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have provided valuable information about the center cards, which has been corroborated by Lucian claiming to be a Mason. Viktor has been consistently questioning and attempting to discredit this information, which is highly suspicious behavior. His persistent skepticism and deflection of suspicion onto others without providing substantial information himself aligns with potential Werewolf tactics. Given the limited information we have, eliminating Viktor seems to be the best move to protect the village team.
> **Marius [Seer]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the game, Ileana has been consistently evasive and has not provided any substantial information about her role or observations. Her sudden accusation against me without offering any insights of her own is highly suspicious. Given that Marius claims to have seen a Minion card in the center, and Lucian corroborates part of Marius's story by claiming to be a Mason, Ileana's behavior aligns with what we might expect from a Minion trying to protect the Werewolves. By voting for Ileana, we have the best chance of eliminating a potential threat to the Village team.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I'm confident in my role and the partial corroboration of Marius's claim about the center cards. Viktor has been consistently questioning and attempting to discredit Marius, who claims to be the Seer and has provided valuable information. Viktor's behavior aligns with what we might expect from a Werewolf or Minion trying to sow discord and protect the Werewolves. His persistent deflection and lack of substantial contribution to identifying the Werewolves are highly suspicious. By voting for Viktor, we have the best chance of eliminating a potential threat to the village team.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, my goal is to eliminate the Werewolves or their allies. Viktor has been consistently suspicious throughout the game. He's aggressively questioned Marius, who claims to be the Seer, and has been deflecting attention onto others without providing substantial information himself. His behavior aligns with what we might expect from a Werewolf or Minion trying to create chaos and distrust. Both Lucian and I have expressed suspicions about Viktor, which adds weight to this decision. While there's always a risk in these games, based on the information available, Viktor seems the most likely threat to the village team.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


The votes were:
* Viktor : Villager : 4
* Ileana : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Viktor was killed. The werewolves win.
