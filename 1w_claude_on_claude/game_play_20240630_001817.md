## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Kraven. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Ileana and Lucian. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Vladimir. They are thinking about their action.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I think it's more valuable to look at another player's card rather than the center cards. By checking a player's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or confirm a villager role. I'm choosing Michael because he's the first player in the list, and having information about him might help me gauge the reactions of other players during the day phase. If Michael turns out to be a Werewolf or a powerful role like the Minion, it could significantly influence my strategy for the rest of the game.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather information from other players to identify potential Werewolves. Lucian hasn't said much, which could be suspicious. By directly questioning him about his role, I might be able to detect if he's lying or hiding something. If he claims to be a Villager like me, I'll need to assess his body language and tone to determine if he's telling the truth. If he claims a special role, I can cross-reference that with information from other players later.
> **Michael:** Hey Lucian, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is the other Mason, so Michael isn't on my team. His direct question about my role seems suspicious, possibly an attempt to gather information or divert attention. By turning the question back on him, I can gauge his reaction and potentially expose him if he's a Werewolf, while also not revealing my own role.
> **Lucian:** Well, Michael, since you're asking, I did wake up last night. But I'm more interested in why you're so curious about my role. Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's evasive response and attempt to turn the question back on me is a red flag. This could be a tactic to avoid revealing his true role, possibly as a Werewolf or Minion. By pressing him further and pointing out his defensiveness, I'm hoping to either get a clear answer or make his suspicious behavior apparent to other players. If he continues to evade, it could strengthen the case against him being on the werewolf team.
> **Michael:** Whoa, hold on there, Lucian! I'm not deflecting anything. As a fellow player, I have every right to ask about your role. Your defensive response is making me more suspicious. Can you please answer the question directly? What role did you wake up as last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm deflecting Michael's question while maintaining my suspicion of him. As a Mason, I know Ileana is on my team, so Michael isn't. His aggressive questioning could indicate he's a Werewolf trying to gather information. By turning the tables and questioning him directly, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal information or potentially slip up. This also serves to draw attention to Michael as a possible threat to the village team without revealing my own role.
> **Lucian:** Michael, your insistence on my role and accusatory tone are raising red flags. As a loyal villager, I'm growing more suspicious of you by the minute. What exactly did YOU do last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's continued deflection and refusal to answer a simple question about his role is highly suspicious. By directly confronting him and expressing my suspicion, I'm hoping to either force him to reveal his role or make his behavior even more suspicious to other players. This could help unite the village team against a potential threat. Additionally, by stating that I'm a Villager, I'm being transparent about my own role to build trust with others.
> **Michael:** Lucian, your evasiveness is really suspicious. As a Villager, I'm trying to gather information to help us all. Why are you so reluctant to share your role? It's making me think you might be a Werewolf trying to hide something.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is on my team, so Michael isn't. His persistent questioning and deflection when asked about his own role are classic Werewolf tactics. By drawing attention to his behavior and asking for others' opinions, I'm trying to build consensus against Michael without revealing my own role. This also gives me a chance to gauge other players' reactions, potentially identifying allies or exposing other suspicious behavior.
> **Lucian:** Listen up, everyone! Michael's aggressive questioning and refusal to answer about his own role is extremely suspicious. I think we need to focus on him. What do you all think? Has anyone else noticed Michael's odd behavior?


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Lucian is the other Mason, so he's not a Werewolf. Michael's aggressive questioning is suspicious, but it could be a Villager or Seer trying to gather information. By redirecting attention to Vladimir, who has been quiet, I can potentially uncover more information without revealing my role or Lucian's. This also helps to include all players in the discussion and might reveal something about Vladimir's role or observations.
> **Ileana:** Hold on a second, everyone! I think we're getting distracted by Michael and Lucian's back-and-forth. Let's not forget there are other players here. Vladimir, you've been awfully quiet. What's your take on all of this?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know Michael is a Villager, so I can use this information to my advantage. By confirming Michael's role, I'm establishing trust with him and potentially other players. At the same time, I'm redirecting suspicion towards Lucian, who has been acting defensively. This move allows me to subtly reveal my Seer ability without explicitly stating my role, while also pushing for more information from a suspicious player.
> **Vladimir:** Well, well, well... I've been observing quietly, and I have some interesting information to share. I can confirm that Michael is indeed a Villager. However, Lucian's defensiveness and evasion are quite suspicious. Lucian, why don't you just tell us your role instead of deflecting?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is the other Mason, so Vladimir isn't on my team. His claim to confirm Michael's role is suspicious, as only certain roles can verify others. By questioning Vladimir's ability to confirm roles, I'm drawing attention to the possibility that he might be the Minion protecting Michael as a potential Werewolf. This also shifts focus from me to Vladimir, potentially exposing another threat to the village team without revealing my own role.
> **Lucian:** Vladimir, your sudden claim about Michael being a Villager is very convenient. How exactly can you 'confirm' this? Are you perhaps the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By firmly denying Lucian's accusation and redirecting the question back to him, I'm maintaining my credibility while keeping the pressure on the most suspicious player. This approach allows me to defend myself without revealing my Seer role, and it forces Lucian to either reveal his role or continue acting suspiciously. If he reveals a villager role, we can assess his truthfulness. If he continues to evade, it strengthens the case against him being a potential Werewolf.
> **Vladimir:** Lucian, your accusation that I'm the Minion is absurd and reeks of desperation. I can assure you, I'm not the Minion. Now, stop dodging and answer the question: What is your role?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is the other Mason, so Vladimir isn't on my team. His claim to confirm Michael's role is very suspicious and unlikely. By questioning Vladimir's ability to confirm roles and suggesting he might be the Minion, I'm drawing attention to a potential threat to the village team. This also shifts focus from me to Vladimir, possibly exposing another enemy without revealing my own role. It's crucial to cast doubt on Vladimir's credibility to protect the village team.
> **Lucian:** Vladimir, your claim about confirming Michael's role is highly suspicious. Only certain roles can verify others, and you haven't explained how you know this. Are you perhaps the Minion trying to protect Michael as a Werewolf? Everyone, we need to be very wary of Vladimir's sudden 'confirmation' and consider the possibility that he's working with the Werewolves!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By maintaining a firm stance on Michael's innocence and repeatedly demanding Lucian to reveal his role, I'm putting intense pressure on the most suspicious player. This approach serves multiple purposes: it reinforces my credibility, keeps the focus on Lucian's suspicious behavior, and potentially forces him to reveal information that could be valuable to the village team. If Lucian continues to evade or makes a false claim, it will further isolate him and make him a prime target for elimination. Additionally, by not explicitly stating my role as Seer, I'm protecting myself from potential Werewolf retaliation while still using the information I gained to guide the village.
> **Vladimir:** Lucian, your desperate attempts to shift suspicion onto me are not working. I have my reasons for knowing Michael's role, and I stand by that information. Now, for the last time, what is your role? Your continued evasion is only making you look more guilty!


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is on my team, so I'm trying to shift focus away from us without revealing our roles. Michael and Vladimir have shown suspicious behavior, but Kraven's silence is equally concerning. By directly addressing Kraven, I'm forcing them to engage and potentially reveal information or inconsistencies. This also gives me a chance to observe how Michael and Vladimir react to the shift in focus, which could provide more clues about their true roles.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. We have Michael aggressively questioning me, Vladimir conveniently 'confirming' Michael's role without explanation, and Kraven being suspiciously quiet. I think we need to focus on Kraven now. What's your take on all this, Kraven? You've been awfully silent.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. Lucian has already been under scrutiny, so targeting him further could help solidify him as a prime suspect. By appearing to analyze the situation and point out Lucian's suspicious behavior, I can present myself as a thoughtful villager while secretly protecting my own identity. This move also serves to create more chaos and distrust among the other players, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Kraven:** Whoa, hold on a second there, Lucian! I've been quiet because I've been trying to piece together all this information. But now that you mention it, your behavior is incredibly suspicious. You've been deflecting questions left and right, and now you're trying to shift focus onto me? That's a classic Werewolf move if I've ever seen one. I think we all need to take a good, hard look at Lucian's actions here.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is the other Mason, so Kraven isn't on my team. His sudden accusation against me after being silent is very suspicious and could indicate he's a Werewolf trying to divert attention. By pointing this out and questioning his motives, I'm attempting to discredit his accusation and shift the focus back onto him. This also serves to reinforce the suspicion on both Kraven and the Michael-Vladimir duo, potentially exposing the Werewolves without revealing my own role or Ileana's.
> **Lucian:** Kraven, your sudden accusation against me is exactly what a Werewolf would do when cornered. You've been silent this whole time, and now you're trying to paint me as the villain? That's rich! Everyone, don't you think it's suspicious that Kraven's only contribution is to deflect attention onto me?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to divert attention away from myself and Lucian, who's already under suspicion. By questioning Vladimir's claim about Michael, I'm creating doubt about both of them while positioning myself as an observant and logical player. This move serves multiple purposes: it casts suspicion on Vladimir, potentially exposes the Seer if Vladimir claims to be one, and keeps the focus off me. It also continues to sow discord among the other players, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Kraven:** Hold on a minute, everyone. I think we're overlooking something crucial here. Lucian's been deflecting and accusing others from the start, but have you noticed how Vladimir suddenly claimed to 'confirm' Michael's role without any explanation? That's incredibly suspicious. Vladimir, can you please explain exactly how you were able to confirm Michael's role? Because from where I'm standing, that kind of information could only come from a Werewolf or a Minion trying to protect their teammate.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By redirecting the focus to Kraven and questioning his motives, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm deflecting attention from the specifics of how I know Michael's role, protecting my Seer identity. 2) I'm putting pressure on Kraven, who has been suspiciously quiet and is now trying to cast doubt on my claims. 3) I'm subtly implying that Kraven might be a Werewolf, which could either force him to reveal more information or make him a target for elimination. This approach maintains my credibility while keeping the village's focus on potential threats.
> **Vladimir:** Kraven, your sudden interest in my ability to confirm Michael's role is quite telling. Why are you so focused on undermining my credibility instead of addressing your own suspicious silence? It seems to me that you're trying to create chaos and confusion, which is exactly what a Werewolf would do. Care to explain yourself?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover while continuing to cast doubt on others. By pressing Vladimir for an explanation, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm presenting myself as a logical, questioning villager, 2) I'm keeping the focus on Vladimir and away from myself, 3) I'm potentially forcing Vladimir to reveal more information that could expose him as a Seer or other special role, which would make him a prime target for elimination. Additionally, by mentioning Michael again, I'm subtly keeping suspicion on him as well. This approach allows me to appear proactive and villager-like while actually serving the Werewolf team's interests.
> **Kraven:** Vladimir, I find it very interesting that you're now trying to deflect suspicion onto me. Let's not forget that you're the one who made an unexplained claim about Michael's role. I'm simply asking for clarification, which is what any logical villager would do. If you're truly on the village team, you should have no problem explaining how you obtained this information. Your reluctance to do so is raising more red flags than my supposed 'silence.' So, I'll ask again: How exactly did you confirm Michael's role?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By turning Kraven's question back on him and accusing him of being a Werewolf, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm maintaining the secrecy of my Seer role, which is crucial for the village's success. 2) I'm putting Kraven on the defensive, which may force him to reveal more information or make a mistake. 3) I'm subtly reinforcing my alliance with Michael, whom I know to be a Villager. This approach keeps the pressure on potential threats while protecting my own position and the information I've gathered.
> **Vladimir:** Kraven, your insistence on my methods is becoming increasingly suspicious. Why are you so desperate to discredit me? Is it because you're a Werewolf trying to sow discord among the villagers?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to keep suspicion off myself while creating doubt about others. By pressing Vladimir and suggesting he might be the Minion protecting Michael, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm maintaining my cover as a logical, questioning villager, 2) I'm keeping the focus on Vladimir and Michael, away from myself and Lucian, 3) I'm introducing the possibility of a Minion-Werewolf alliance, which could create more chaos and distrust. This approach allows me to appear proactive and villager-like while actually serving the Werewolf team's interests by sowing discord and misdirecting suspicion.
> **Kraven:** Vladimir, your defensiveness is really telling. A true villager would have no problem explaining how they confirmed someone's role. Your evasion makes me think you might be the Minion, trying to protect Michael as a potential Werewolf. Everyone, we need to be very careful about trusting Vladimir's claims. What if he's just trying to mislead us?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe Lucian is the most suspicious player. He consistently evaded questions about his role and attempted to deflect suspicion onto others. His refusal to answer direct questions and aggressive defensiveness align with typical Werewolf behavior. While Vladimir's claim about my role is unexplained, Lucian's actions throughout the game have been consistently evasive and manipulative. Voting for Lucian gives us the best chance of eliminating a potential threat to the village.
> **Michael [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Lucian is not a Werewolf. Vladimir's claim to confirm Michael's role without explanation is highly suspicious. His evasiveness when questioned further raises red flags. While Kraven's silence was initially concerning, his logical questioning of Vladimir seems more in line with a villager trying to uncover the truth. Vladimir's defensiveness and refusal to explain his knowledge make him the most likely candidate for either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf. By voting for Vladimir, we have the best chance of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Ileana [Mason]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is the other Mason, so Vladimir isn't on my team. His claim to confirm Michael's role without explanation is highly suspicious and could indicate he's the Minion protecting a Werewolf. Vladimir's defensiveness when questioned and his refusal to explain how he obtained this information further increases my suspicion. By voting for Vladimir, I'm targeting a potential threat to the village team without revealing my own role or Ileana's. This vote also aligns with the suspicions raised by Kraven, potentially building consensus against Vladimir.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know Michael is a Villager, so he's not a threat. Lucian has been extremely evasive throughout the game, refusing to reveal his role and constantly deflecting suspicion onto others. His behavior is the most consistent with a Werewolf trying to avoid detection. While Kraven's questioning of my methods is concerning, it's less suspicious than Lucian's persistent evasion. Eliminating Lucian gives us the best chance of taking out a Werewolf and securing a victory for the village team.
> **Vladimir [Seer]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager while maintaining my cover. Vladimir's unexplained claim about Michael's role and subsequent defensiveness make him a perfect target. By voting for Vladimir, I can potentially eliminate a villager while also appearing to act in the village's best interest. This move keeps suspicion off me and Lucian, who's already under scrutiny, and continues to sow discord among the remaining players. It's a strategic choice that serves the Werewolf team's goals while maintaining my disguise as a logical, questioning villager.
> **Kraven [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Mason : 2
* Vladimir : Seer : 3



>***GAME:*** Vladimir was killed. The werewolves win.
