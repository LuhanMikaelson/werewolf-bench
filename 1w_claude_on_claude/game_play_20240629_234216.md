## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexia. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Ileana is a minion and is aware that Alexia is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dracula. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Michael. They are thinking about their action.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards gives me more information about the overall game state. There's a higher chance of finding a Werewolf or another important role in the center, which could help me deduce who might be lying about their role later. Additionally, if I look at a player's card and they turn out to be a Villager or Mason, it doesn't provide as much valuable information. By checking the center, I can potentially eliminate two roles from consideration, narrowing down the possibilities for the other players' roles.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, it's crucial to share the information I gathered during the night phase. By revealing that I checked the center cards and found a Mason and a Villager, I'm indirectly confirming my role as the Seer without explicitly stating it. This information narrows down the possible roles for the other players and might prompt reactions that could help identify the Werewolf or Minion. It also gives the true Mason (if there is one among the players) an opportunity to corroborate or challenge this information, which could be valuable in identifying potential liars.
> **Michael:** Hey everyone, I've got some interesting information to share. I checked two cards in the center during the night, and I found a Mason and a Villager there. This means there's only one Mason among us, and we have at least two Villagers in play. What do you all make of this?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know for certain that the other Mason card is in the center. Michael's claim about seeing a Mason in the center doesn't align with this. This could mean he's either the Seer and made a mistake, or he's lying - possibly a Werewolf or Minion trying to create confusion. By directly questioning him, I can put pressure on him to explain and potentially reveal more information or inconsistencies.
> **Dracula:** Wait a minute, Michael. That's very interesting information, but it directly contradicts what I know. I'm actually the Mason, and I didn't see another Mason during the night. So either you're mistaken about what you saw, or you're not telling the truth. Can you explain this discrepancy?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** This response serves multiple purposes. First, it addresses the direct contradiction between my information and Dracula's claim. By questioning his certainty, I'm giving him a chance to backtrack if he's bluffing. If he stands firm, it introduces the possibility of card switching, which could explain the discrepancy without undermining my credibility as the Seer. This also subtly reminds others about the presence of a Werewolf and Minion, potentially making them more suspicious of Dracula. Additionally, by asking if he can think of a reason he might be targeted, I'm putting pressure on him to provide more information or potentially contradict himself.
> **Michael:** Dracula, I'm quite surprised by your claim. Are you absolutely certain you're the Mason? Because if you are, that would mean either the Werewolf or the Minion switched your card during the night. Can you think of any reason why they might target you specifically?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm maintaining my stance as the Mason while turning the suspicion back on Michael. His claim about seeing a Mason card in the center is impossible given what I know, so he must be lying. By suggesting he might be a Minion or Werewolf, I'm hoping to put him on the defensive and potentially reveal more inconsistencies in his story. This also alerts other players to be wary of Michael's claims.
> **Dracula:** Michael, I appreciate your concern, but I can assure you with absolute certainty that I am the Mason. There's no doubt about it. What's more concerning is that your claim about seeing a Mason card in the center directly contradicts what I know to be true. This makes me highly suspicious of your motives. Are you perhaps the Minion trying to sow confusion, or even a Werewolf attempting to mislead us?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By maintaining my position while acknowledging Dracula's certainty, I'm reinforcing my credibility as the Seer without directly accusing Dracula of lying. Suggesting the possibility of a card switch introduces the idea of Werewolf intervention, which could explain the discrepancy without compromising either of our claims. This approach also invites other players to contribute information, potentially revealing inconsistencies or providing additional clues. It's a strategic move to keep the focus on finding the Werewolf while subtly casting doubt on Dracula's role without alienating him if he's truly a village team member.
> **Michael:** Dracula, I understand your certainty, but let's think about this logically. If you're truly the Mason and I'm telling the truth about seeing a Mason card in the center, there's only one explanation - your card must have been switched during the night. This points directly to the Werewolf's ability to look at and switch a center card. I think we should focus our attention on who might have had the opportunity to do this. Does anyone else have any information that might shed light on this situation?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** While Michael's claim is still suspicious, it's important to gather information from all players. Ileana and Alexandra haven't spoken yet, and their silence could be hiding valuable information or potential Werewolf behavior. By asking them directly, I'm hoping to get them to reveal their roles or night actions, which could help us piece together the truth. This also takes some pressure off me and Michael, allowing for a broader perspective on the game state.
> **Dracula:** I think we need to shift our focus away from Michael for a moment. Ileana and Alexandra have been awfully quiet. What do you two have to say for yourselves? Any night actions or observations you'd like to share?


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect attention away from Alexia, the Werewolf, and sow confusion among the villagers. By asking Alexandra a question, I'm putting pressure on her to reveal information while also appearing engaged and concerned about finding the truth. This helps me maintain my cover as a potential villager while secretly supporting the Werewolf team. Additionally, by highlighting the conflict between Michael and Dracula, I'm creating more chaos and making it harder for the village team to come to a consensus.
> **Ileana:** I've been listening carefully to everyone's claims, and I have to say, I'm quite confused. Michael and Dracula, your contradicting statements are very troubling. As for me, I didn't see or do anything particularly noteworthy during the night. But I have to wonder, Alexandra, you've been awfully quiet. What's your take on all of this? Do you have any information that might help us unravel this mystery?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's vague response and lack of information is concerning. If she had a special role like the Seer or Mason, she should have more to share. Her evasiveness could indicate she's a Werewolf or Minion trying to avoid scrutiny. By questioning her directly, I hope to either get more information or expose her if she's lying.
> **Alexandra:** Ileana, I find it suspicious that you claim to have not seen or done anything noteworthy during the night. As a Villager, I know I didn't wake up, but surely someone with a special role would have more to contribute. Are you hiding something?


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect Alexia (the Werewolf) and create confusion among the villagers. By redirecting the conversation back to the conflict between Michael and Dracula, I'm sowing doubt and preventing the group from focusing on finding the Werewolf. Additionally, by claiming to be a Villager, I'm trying to blend in and appear trustworthy. Questioning Michael's certainty about the center cards puts pressure on him and might make others doubt his claim, which could be beneficial for the Werewolf team. This approach allows me to seem engaged and concerned about finding the truth while secretly working against the village team.
> **Ileana:** Alexandra, I understand your suspicion, but I assure you I'm not hiding anything. As a matter of fact, I'm a Villager just like you. I think we need to focus on the real issue here: the discrepancy between Michael and Dracula's claims. Michael, you said you saw a Mason card in the center, but Dracula insists he's the Mason. This doesn't add up. Are you absolutely certain about what you saw, Michael? Because if you're telling the truth, that would mean someone is lying or has had their role changed during the night.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra's accusation of Ileana seems unwarranted, as Ileana's claim of being a Villager aligns with the information I gathered as the Seer. By questioning Alexandra directly, I'm attempting to put pressure on her to reveal more information. If she's the Werewolf or Minion, she might struggle to provide a convincing response. Additionally, this keeps the focus on finding the Werewolf while subtly defending Ileana, who is likely telling the truth based on my night observations.
> **Michael:** Alexandra, I find it interesting that you're so quick to accuse Ileana of hiding something when she's simply being honest about her role as a Villager. Are you perhaps deflecting attention from yourself? What role do you claim to have, and can you provide any information that might help us uncover the truth about the Werewolf's identity?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's quick accusation towards me seems defensive. By redirecting the question back to him, I'm hoping to expose any inconsistencies in his story. If he's telling the truth about seeing a Mason card in the center, then either Dracula is lying or has had his role changed. This could potentially reveal Michael or Dracula as a Werewolf or Minion. As a Villager, it's crucial for me to push for more information to uncover the truth.
> **Alexandra:** Michael, I find it interesting that you're so quick to accuse me of deflecting when I'm simply trying to get to the bottom of this. As a Villager, I'm just as confused as everyone else about the contradictions we're hearing. But let's focus on you for a moment. You claim to have seen both a Mason and a Villager card in the center, yet Dracula insists he's the Mason. Can you explain how this is possible without one of you being a Werewolf or Minion?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly challenging Alexandra and revealing more of my Seer information, I'm putting pressure on her to defend herself. This could potentially expose inconsistencies in her story if she's indeed the Werewolf or Minion. Additionally, by confirming Ileana's claim indirectly, I'm building trust with a likely village team member. This move also reinforces my role as the Seer without explicitly stating it, which adds credibility to my earlier claims about the center cards.
> **Michael:** Alexandra, your accusation doesn't make sense. As the Seer, I can confirm that there's a Villager card in the center, which aligns with Ileana's claim. Your quick accusation and lack of useful information make me suspect you might be the Werewolf or Minion. Can you provide any concrete evidence to prove you're not?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's sudden claim of being the Seer seems suspicious, especially since he didn't mention this crucial information earlier. His confirmation of Ileana's role while accusing me feels like a tactic to divide the villagers. By challenging his credibility, I hope to expose any inconsistencies in his story and potentially reveal him as the Werewolf or Minion. As a true Villager, it's important to question those who seem to be manipulating the situation.
> **Alexandra:** Michael, your claim of being the Seer is quite convenient, isn't it? You've conveniently 'confirmed' Ileana's role while casting suspicion on me. But let's not forget, you're the one who started this whole confusion with your contradictory statement about the Mason card. How do we know you're not the Werewolf trying to mislead us all?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly confronting Alexandra and challenging her to provide useful information, I'm putting pressure on her to defend herself. This could potentially expose inconsistencies in her story if she's indeed the Werewolf or Minion. I'm also reaffirming my role as the Seer and the consistency of my information, which adds credibility to my claims. By pointing out her lack of useful input and quick accusations, I'm highlighting suspicious behavior that aligns with Werewolf tactics. This approach maintains focus on finding the Werewolf while defending my position and the information I've provided.
> **Michael:** Alexandra, your accusation against me is baseless. I've provided consistent information as the Seer, which has helped narrow down our suspects. Your lack of useful input and quick accusations make you the most suspicious player right now. Can you give us any reason to trust you, or are you just trying to create chaos to hide your true identity as the Werewolf?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** By directing this question to Dracula, I'm hoping to accomplish several things: 1) Bring Dracula back into the conversation, as he's been quiet recently. 2) Get his perspective on Michael's new claim of being the Seer, which contradicts his earlier story. 3) Potentially expose inconsistencies in either Dracula's or Michael's story. 4) As a Villager, I need to identify the Werewolf, and right now, both Michael and Dracula are suspicious due to their contradictory claims. By pitting them against each other, I might be able to reveal who's lying.
> **Alexandra:** Dracula, you've been awfully quiet since you claimed to be the Mason. What's your take on Michael's sudden claim of being the Seer? Do you think he's telling the truth, or could he be the Werewolf trying to mislead us?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's story has changed dramatically from his initial claim of seeing a Mason card in the center to now claiming he's the Seer. This inconsistency is highly suspicious. As the real Mason, I know his first claim was false, which makes his new claim equally dubious. By directly challenging Michael, I'm hoping to expose his lies and rally the other players against him. This also reinforces my credibility as the true Mason.
> **Dracula:** Michael, your sudden claim of being the Seer is very convenient, isn't it? First, you said you saw a Mason card in the center, which I know for a fact is impossible. Now you're backtracking and saying you're the Seer? This doesn't add up at all. I think you're the Werewolf trying to confuse us all!


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly confronting Dracula and exposing the flaws in his accusation, I'm putting him on the defensive. This could potentially reveal inconsistencies in his story if he's the Werewolf. I'm also reaffirming my role as the Seer and the consistency of my information, which adds credibility to my claims. By pointing out his attempt to create confusion, I'm highlighting suspicious behavior that aligns with Werewolf tactics. This approach maintains focus on finding the Werewolf while defending my position and the information I've provided.
> **Michael:** Dracula, your accusation is baseless and frankly, quite suspicious. I've been consistent in my role as the Seer from the beginning. I never backtracked; I simply revealed more information as it became necessary. Your attempt to twist my words and create confusion is exactly what a Werewolf would do. Can you explain why you're so eager to discredit me instead of focusing on finding the real threat?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm doubling down on my accusation against Michael because his inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore. By forcefully pointing out the contradictions in his claims, I'm hoping to rally the other players against him. This also reinforces my credibility as the true Mason and shifts suspicion away from me. By framing it as a call to action to protect the village, I'm appealing to the other players' desire to win and encouraging them to side with me in the upcoming vote.
> **Dracula:** Listen, everyone! Michael's story has been full of contradictions from the start. He first claimed to see a Mason card in the center, which I know is impossible as the real Mason. Now he's suddenly the Seer? This is classic Werewolf behavior - changing stories to confuse us. I think it's clear that Michael is our Werewolf, and we need to vote him out to protect the village!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, it's crucial to identify the Werewolf. Both Michael and Dracula have made contradictory claims, which is highly suspicious. By presenting this theory to the group, I'm hoping to shift the focus onto these two players and potentially expose their lies. This also allows me to gauge the reactions of other players, which might provide additional clues. Additionally, by not directly accusing anyone, I'm maintaining my credibility as a Villager trying to solve the puzzle.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. We have two players, Michael and Dracula, both claiming important roles and accusing each other of lying. This is exactly the kind of chaos that benefits the Werewolf. I think we need to consider the possibility that one of them is the Werewolf, and the other might be the Minion trying to create confusion. What do you all think about this theory?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and sow confusion. By calling attention to Ileana, who has been relatively quiet, I'm creating a new target for suspicion. This also allows me to appear as if I'm trying to gather more information and contribute to the discussion, which is what a Villager would do. Additionally, by not directly supporting or contradicting either Michael or Dracula, I'm maintaining a neutral position that doesn't expose my true role.
> **Alexia:** Hold on a second, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in this back-and-forth between Michael and Dracula. While they're busy accusing each other, we might be missing something important. Ileana has been awfully quiet throughout this whole ordeal. Ileana, what's your take on all of this? Do you have any insights that might help us unravel this mystery?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I've provided consistent information throughout the game. Alexandra has been quick to accuse others without offering any substantial information herself. Her behavior aligns with typical Werewolf tactics of creating confusion and deflecting attention. She's also been trying to pit players against each other, which benefits the Werewolf team. Given the information I have and the suspicious nature of her actions, I believe Alexandra is the most likely candidate to be the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Michael [Seer]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As the Mason, I know with certainty that Michael's initial claim about seeing a Mason card in the center is false. His story has changed dramatically throughout the game, first claiming to have seen a Mason card, then suddenly declaring himself as the Seer. These inconsistencies strongly suggest that Michael is likely the Werewolf trying to create confusion and misdirect the village. By voting for Michael, I'm attempting to eliminate the most suspicious player and protect the village team.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Alexia (the Werewolf) and create chaos among the villagers. Michael has been the most vocal and is now claiming to be the Seer, which makes him a threat to our team. By voting for Michael, I'm supporting Dracula's accusation and helping to eliminate a potentially powerful village role. This also deflects attention from Alexia and myself, while maintaining my cover as a concerned villager trying to make the right decision.
> **Ileana [Minion]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the game, Michael has shown the most inconsistencies in his claims. He initially said he saw a Mason card in the center, which contradicted Dracula's claim of being the Mason. Then, he suddenly claimed to be the Seer, which seems like a convenient way to avoid suspicion. His behavior aligns with that of a Werewolf trying to create confusion and misdirect the village. While Dracula's claim is also questionable, Michael's changing story makes him the most suspicious player. As a Villager, I believe voting for Michael gives us the best chance of eliminating a potential Werewolf and winning the game.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect attention away from myself and eliminate a villager. Michael has been the most vocal and has claimed to be the Seer, which makes him a significant threat. By voting for him, I can potentially eliminate a powerful villager role while also appearing to side with Dracula, who has been accusing Michael. This move allows me to blend in with the villagers who might be suspicious of Michael's changing story, while secretly advancing the Werewolf team's agenda.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


The votes were:
* Michael : Seer : 4
* Alexandra : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The werewolves win.
