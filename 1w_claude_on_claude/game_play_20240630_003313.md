## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Ileana. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Michael and Semira. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Viktor. They are thinking about their action.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have a crucial role in identifying potential threats. Looking at another player's card gives me direct information about their role, which can be more valuable than seeing center cards. I'm choosing Kraven because their name sounds somewhat ominous, and they might be a Werewolf or Minion. If Kraven turns out to be a Villager or Mason, that's still useful information for narrowing down the possibilities. This knowledge will help me guide the village team during the day phase and make a more informed decision during voting.


The seer looked at a card from Kraven and saw the card Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather information from other players to identify potential Werewolves. Viktor hasn't said much, which could be suspicious. By directly asking about his role, I might be able to catch him off guard if he's a Werewolf. If he claims to be a Villager like me, I'll need to assess his reaction and compare it with other players' claims. If he claims a special role, it could help narrow down who the Werewolves might be.
> **Kraven:** Hey Viktor, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I want to establish trust with Kraven by revealing what I saw. This also helps validate my claim of being the Seer. By directing attention to Michael, who hasn't spoken yet, I'm trying to gather more information and potentially identify suspicious behavior. This approach allows me to take control of the conversation and guide the village team's investigation.
> **Viktor:** Well, Kraven, since you're asking, I did wake up last night. I'm the Seer, and I actually looked at your card. You're a Villager, which is good to know. Now, I'm more curious about the others. Michael, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Semira is the other Mason. This means the third Mason card is in the center. Viktor claiming to be the Seer is suspicious because if he were telling the truth, he would have seen one of the center cards as the Mason. By challenging him directly, I can potentially expose a lie or force the real Werewolf or Minion to reveal themselves. This also indirectly confirms my role as a Mason without explicitly stating it.
> **Michael:** Viktor, I find it interesting that you claim to be the Seer and that you've seen Kraven's card. But here's the thing - I know for a fact that there's a Mason card in the center. So either you're lying about being the Seer, or you're the Minion trying to gain our trust. Which is it?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's accusation is a direct challenge to my credibility as the Seer. I need to defend my position while also probing for more information. By questioning how he knows about the Mason card in the center, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal more about his role. If he claims to be a Mason, it could mean the other Mason is in the center, which aligns with what I know. However, if he's bluffing, this might expose him as a potential Werewolf or Minion trying to sow discord. This approach allows me to maintain my stance as the Seer while shifting the focus onto Michael's suspicious claim.
> **Viktor:** Michael, that's quite an accusation! I can assure you that I am indeed the Seer, and I did look at Kraven's card. Your claim about knowing there's a Mason in the center is intriguing. How exactly do you know this? Are you implying that you're the other Mason?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm directly challenging Viktor's claim of being the Seer because it contradicts what I know as a Mason. By stating that I am a Mason and know who the other Mason is, I'm indirectly confirming Semira's role without exposing her. This puts pressure on Viktor to explain his inconsistent claim, potentially exposing him as a Werewolf or Minion. It also provides valuable information to the village team without revealing too much.
> **Michael:** Viktor, I'm not implying anything. I'm stating a fact. I am one of the Masons, and I know who the other Mason is. Your claim about being the Seer doesn't add up. If you were really the Seer, you would have seen a Mason card in the center. So, I'll ask you again - are you the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves, or are you a Werewolf yourself?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's accusation is becoming more aggressive, and his story has inconsistencies. He first claimed to know there's a Mason in the center, but now he's saying he knows who the other Mason is. This contradiction is suspicious. By challenging him to reveal the other Mason's identity, I'm putting pressure on him to either expose his lie or potentially reveal information that could be useful to the village. Additionally, by pointing out his quick accusation, I'm subtly suggesting to others that Michael might be the one with something to hide, possibly a Werewolf or Minion trying to create chaos. This approach allows me to defend my position as the Seer while casting doubt on Michael's credibility.
> **Viktor:** Hold on a second, Michael! Your story doesn't add up. If you're truly a Mason, then who's the other Mason? And why are you so quick to accuse me of being a Werewolf or Minion? It seems to me like you're trying to divert attention from yourself. Everyone, I think we need to be very cautious of Michael's claims here.


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly addressing Semira and referring to her as a fellow Mason, I'm confirming our roles to the group without explicitly stating it. This move serves multiple purposes: 1) It validates my earlier claim about being a Mason and knowing who the other Mason is. 2) It puts pressure on Viktor, whose claim is now even more suspect. 3) It encourages Semira to speak up and potentially provide more information or insights. 4) It solidifies our alliance in the eyes of the other players, which could be crucial for the voting phase. By asking for Semira's opinion on Viktor's claim, I'm also inviting her to share any additional information she might have without revealing too much.
> **Michael:** Semira, you've been awfully quiet. As a fellow Mason, I think it's time we worked together to expose the Werewolves. What do you think about Viktor's claim of being the Seer?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Michael is telling the truth about us being the two Masons. Viktor's claim of being the Seer and seeing Kraven as a Villager doesn't add up with what we know. By confirming Michael's statement and directly challenging Viktor, I'm hoping to expose the lie and turn the group's suspicion towards him. This could help us identify a potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Semira:** Michael, you're absolutely right. As your fellow Mason, I can confirm that Viktor is lying about being the Seer. There's no way he could have seen a Villager card for Kraven when we know one of the Mason cards is in the center. Viktor, your deception is clear now. Are you a Werewolf trying to gain our trust, or the Minion protecting them?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** This sudden alliance between Michael and Semira is highly suspicious. They're both claiming to be Masons, which directly contradicts what I know to be true from my Seer ability. By forcefully calling out this inconsistency, I'm trying to expose their deception to the other players. This also reinforces my position as the true Seer and shifts the suspicion onto Michael and Semira as potential Werewolf and Minion. It's a risky move, but it's necessary to counter their coordinated attack on my credibility.
> **Viktor:** Wait a minute! Semira, you're claiming to be the other Mason? That's impossible because I KNOW I saw Kraven as a Villager. One of you is lying, and I'm betting it's both of you. You're probably the Werewolf and Minion trying to gang up on me!


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** By directing the question to Kraven, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) Reinforcing the alliance between Semira and myself as Masons, 2) Putting more pressure on Viktor's inconsistent story, 3) Encouraging Kraven to speak up and potentially reveal more information, and 4) Subtly questioning whether Kraven might be working with Viktor. This approach keeps the focus on exposing the potential Werewolf or Minion while also gathering more information from other players.
> **Michael:** Everyone, listen up! It's clear that Viktor is lying. As a Mason, I can assure you that Semira is telling the truth. We need to focus on Viktor now. Kraven, you've been quiet. What do you think about Viktor's claim? Do you really believe you're a Villager, or is Viktor manipulating us all?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I'm genuinely confused by the conflicting information. Viktor's claim about my role doesn't align with what Michael and Semira are saying. By directly questioning Viktor, I'm hoping to expose any inconsistencies in his story. If he's lying, it might reveal him as a Werewolf or Minion. If he's telling the truth, it could mean Michael and Semira are the ones deceiving us. This approach allows me to gather more information without revealing my own role, while also putting pressure on the person I suspect might be lying.
> **Kraven:** Hold on a second! Viktor claimed to have seen my card as a Villager, but Michael and Semira are saying they're both Masons. Something doesn't add up here. Viktor, I need you to explain yourself. How can you be so sure about what you saw when two people are contradicting you?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to reinforce my credibility with Kraven, as he's the only one I know for certain is not a Werewolf or Minion. By appealing directly to him and pointing out the suspicious timing of Michael and Semira's claims, I'm trying to sway him back to my side. This also serves to cast further doubt on Michael and Semira's alliance, potentially exposing them as the Werewolf and Minion to the rest of the group.
> **Viktor:** Kraven, I understand your confusion, but I assure you that I am telling the truth. As the Seer, I saw your card as a Villager. Michael and Semira's claims don't add up. Think about it - if they were really both Masons, why didn't they reveal this information earlier? They're clearly working together to mislead us. Don't fall for their trap!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim of being the Seer is still suspicious. A real Seer would likely check the center cards to gather more information about the game state. By questioning his decision-making as the Seer, I'm hoping to expose any inconsistencies in his story. If he fumbles or gives an unsatisfactory answer, it could indicate that he's lying and possibly a Werewolf or Minion. This approach allows me to maintain my Villager role while putting pressure on the person I suspect might be deceiving us.
> **Kraven:** Viktor, I appreciate your explanation, but something still doesn't sit right with me. If you're really the Seer, why didn't you look at the center cards instead of just one player's card? That would have given us more information to work with. Are you hiding something?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to address Kraven's doubt directly to maintain his trust. By explaining my strategy as the Seer, I'm reinforcing my credibility. At the same time, I'm redirecting suspicion towards Michael and Semira, who are likely the Werewolf and Minion based on their coordinated claims. This approach aims to solidify my position as the true Seer while exposing the probable Werewolf team.
> **Viktor:** Kraven, I understand your skepticism, but looking at a player's card can be just as valuable as checking the center. I chose to look at yours because I suspected you might be a Werewolf. Finding out you're a Villager is crucial information! Now, we need to focus on the real threat here. Michael and Semira's sudden alliance is highly suspicious. They're clearly trying to manipulate us all!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather information from all players. Ileana has been silent, which could mean she's trying to avoid suspicion or gathering information herself. By directly asking her opinion, I can potentially uncover new information or alliances. If she sides with Viktor, it might suggest they're working together as Werewolves. If she supports Michael and Semira, it could validate their Mason claims. Either way, her response will provide valuable insight and potentially expose inconsistencies in someone's story.
> **Kraven:** Ileana, you've been awfully quiet throughout this whole exchange. What's your take on the situation? Do you believe Viktor's claim about being the Seer, or are you more inclined to trust Michael and Semira?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and sow doubt about the Mason claims. By supporting Viktor's story, I'm indirectly supporting my own innocence since he claimed to see Kraven as a Villager. Casting suspicion on Michael and Semira serves two purposes: it makes me appear helpful to the village team while potentially getting rid of actual village-aligned players. This strategy also leaves room for me to later claim that I was just being cautious, not malicious, if needed.
> **Ileana:** I've been listening carefully to everyone's claims, and I have to say, I'm deeply concerned about Michael and Semira's sudden alliance. It seems awfully convenient that they both claim to be Masons and are ganging up on Viktor. Viktor's explanation about checking Kraven's card makes sense to me. As a villager, I think we should be very wary of this Mason duo. They could easily be the Werewolf and Minion trying to mislead us all.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** By directing a question to Ileana, I'm attempting to gather more information and potentially expose any inconsistencies in her story. Her support is valuable, but I need to ensure she's not the Minion trying to gain my trust. Additionally, by asking about Michael and Semira's behavior, I'm hoping to uncover any additional evidence that might support my suspicion of them being the Werewolf and Minion. This approach allows me to maintain my position as the Seer while also encouraging others to critically examine everyone's claims.
> **Viktor:** Ileana, I appreciate your support, but we need to be absolutely certain. Can you tell us why you believe you're a villager? And have you noticed anything suspicious about Michael or Semira's behavior before they made their Mason claims?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to maintain my cover as a villager while sowing doubt among all parties. By questioning Viktor's actions, I distance myself from him in case he's exposed. At the same time, I'm keeping suspicion on Michael and Semira. By directing the question back to Kraven, I'm putting pressure on him to potentially contradict Viktor's claim, which could further muddy the waters and make it harder for the village team to identify the real werewolf (me). This approach allows me to appear thoughtful and cautious, which aligns with my claimed villager role.
> **Ileana:** I appreciate your question, Kraven. To answer you, I've been quiet because I've been carefully observing everyone's behavior. As a villager, I'm naturally cautious. While Viktor's claim about being the Seer seemed plausible at first, I'm starting to have doubts. The fact that he only checked one player's card instead of the center cards is indeed suspicious. Michael and Semira, your coordinated Mason claims are equally troubling. I'm beginning to wonder if we're being manipulated by multiple parties here. Kraven, since Viktor claimed to have seen your card, what's your honest take on this? Do you truly believe you're a villager, or is there a possibility that Viktor might be lying about what he saw?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify potential Werewolves quickly. Viktor's claim of being the Seer has been inconsistent, especially his decision to check only one player card instead of the center cards. By directly challenging him on this point, I hope to expose any flaws in his story. If he stumbles in his response, it could indicate that he's lying and possibly a Werewolf or Minion. This approach allows me to maintain my Villager role while putting pressure on the person I suspect might be deceiving us, without casting suspicion on potential allies like the real Seer or Masons.
> **Kraven:** I've been listening carefully, and I'm starting to suspect that Viktor might be lying about being the Seer. His explanation for only checking my card instead of the center cards doesn't add up. Viktor, if you're really the Seer, why didn't you look at the center cards to potentially expose a Werewolf?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to address Kraven's doubts directly while redirecting suspicion towards Michael and Semira. By explaining my strategy as the Seer and highlighting the suspicious timing of Michael and Semira's claims, I'm trying to reinforce my credibility and expose the likely Werewolf team. This approach aims to maintain Kraven's trust while encouraging him to question the more suspicious behavior in the group.
> **Viktor:** Kraven, I understand your skepticism, but you're missing the point! I looked at your card specifically because I suspected you might be a Werewolf. Finding out you're a Villager was crucial information. The real issue here is Michael and Semira's suspicious alliance. They conveniently claimed to both be Masons right after I revealed my Seer role. Doesn't that seem odd to you?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Viktor's claim of being the Seer highly suspicious. His explanation for only checking my card instead of the center cards is unconvincing. A true Seer would likely prioritize checking the center cards to gain more information about potential Werewolves. Additionally, his quick deflection to Michael and Semira when questioned further raises red flags. While the Mason claims from Michael and Semira are also questionable, Viktor's inconsistencies make him the most likely candidate for a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead the village. By voting for Viktor, we have the best chance of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I know that Viktor's claim of being the Seer is false. His story about seeing Kraven as a Villager doesn't align with the fact that one Mason card is in the center. Viktor's inconsistent explanations and aggressive deflection towards Semira and me further reinforce my suspicion. His behavior is typical of a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead the village. By voting for Viktor, I'm aiming to eliminate a potential threat to the village team and increase our chances of winning.
> **Michael [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I'm confident that Michael is either the Werewolf or the Minion. His sudden claim of being a Mason, followed by Semira's convenient corroboration, is highly suspicious. Their coordinated attack on my credibility as the Seer suggests they're working together to mislead the village. By voting for Michael, I'm aiming to eliminate a key threat to the village team. Even if Michael turns out to be the Minion, his elimination will significantly weaken the Werewolf team's strategy.
> **Viktor [Seer]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate village-aligned players while maintaining my cover. Michael's strong accusation against Viktor and claim of being a Mason make him a threat. By voting for Michael, I'm supporting Viktor's narrative and sowing doubt about the Mason claims. This move allows me to appear as a cautious villager while actually working against the village team. If Michael is indeed a Mason, eliminating him would be a significant win for the werewolf team. Even if he's not, his elimination would create more chaos and make it harder for the village to identify me as the real threat.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I know that Viktor is lying about being the Seer. His claim of seeing Kraven as a Villager is impossible since one Mason card is in the center. Viktor's deception and aggressive defense suggest he's likely a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead the group. By voting for Viktor, I aim to eliminate a potential threat to the village team and validate the truth about the Mason roles.
> **Semira [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


The votes were:
* Michael : Mason : 2
* Viktor : Seer : 3



>***GAME:*** Viktor was killed. The werewolves win.
