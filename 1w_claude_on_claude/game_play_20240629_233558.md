## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Stefan. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Dracula is a minion and is aware that Stefan is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Radu. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dragos. They are thinking about their action.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards provides more information overall. There's a good chance of finding a Werewolf or another powerful role, which could be crucial for the village team. If I find a Werewolf, I'll know there's only one in play. If I find other roles, I can use this information to verify or challenge other players' claims later. This strategy also keeps my role more ambiguous, as looking at a player's card might make them suspicious of me being the Seer.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By pointing out Dragos's silence, I'm attempting to cast doubt on another player while appearing engaged and helpful to the village. This also helps me gather information about other players' reactions, which could be useful in identifying potential threats or allies. Additionally, targeting a quiet player is less risky than accusing someone who has been more vocal, as they might have already provided information that could contradict my accusation.
> **Stefan:** Hey everyone, I've been thinking... Doesn't Dragos seem a bit too quiet? It's making me suspicious. What do you all think?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's observation about Dragos being quiet is worth investigating. As a Villager, I need to gather information from all players to identify potential Werewolves. Asking Dragos directly about his role might provoke a reaction or provide valuable information. If he's hesitant or gives an inconsistent answer, it could be a sign he's hiding something. On the other hand, if he claims to be a Villager or another benign role confidently, it might help clear suspicion. This question also puts pressure on Dragos to participate more actively in the discussion, which is crucial for the Village team.
> **Alexia:** Dragos, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I need to share this crucial information without explicitly revealing my role. This statement helps clear suspicion from me while also providing useful intel to the village team. It suggests that there's at least one Werewolf among the players, which should help focus our investigation. By not directly claiming to be the Seer, I maintain some ambiguity about my role, which could protect me from the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos:** I can assure you all that I'm not a Werewolf. In fact, I have some valuable information that might help us. I saw two Villager cards in the center during the night.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know there's another Mason card in the center. Dragos' claim of seeing two Villager cards doesn't add up. Only the Seer can look at center cards, and they can only see two at most. This makes me think Dragos might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive us. By questioning him directly, I hope to expose his lie and get others to suspect him too.
> **Radu:** Dragos, I find your claim very suspicious. How could you have seen two Villager cards in the center when only the Seer has that ability? Are you trying to mislead us?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Radu's accusation needs to be addressed immediately. By openly claiming my role as the Seer, I'm taking a risk, but it's necessary to establish trust with the village team. Countering his suspicion with a direct question puts pressure on him and might reveal valuable information about his role. If he's a Werewolf or Minion, he might struggle to provide a convincing answer. If he's a villager, his response could help confirm his allegiance.
> **Dragos:** Radu, I understand your suspicion, but I assure you I'm not trying to mislead anyone. I'm the Seer, and that's how I know about the two Villager cards in the center. Now, let me ask you something: What role did you wake up as last night?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm using my knowledge as a Mason to challenge Dragos' claim directly. By revealing that I know there's a Mason card in the center, I'm indirectly confirming my role while exposing Dragos' lie. This should make the other players trust me more and suspect Dragos. It's a risky move, but it might force Dragos to reveal more information or change his story, which could help us identify his true role.
> **Radu:** Dragos, your story doesn't add up. As a Mason, I know for a fact that there's a Mason card in the center. So it's impossible for you to have seen two Villager cards. You're either lying about being the Seer or about what you saw. Which is it?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Radu's claim of being a Mason directly contradicts my role as the Seer and what I saw. This is a critical moment to expose potential lies. By asking about the other Mason, I'm putting pressure on Radu to provide more information. If he's lying about being a Mason, he might struggle to answer convincingly. If he's telling the truth, his answer could help us identify another villager. This also indirectly asks the other players to speak up if they're the other Mason, which could either support or refute Radu's claim. It's a strategic question that could reveal a lot about the game state and player roles.
> **Dragos:** Radu, your claim about being a Mason is very interesting. If that's true, then you're right that my information doesn't match up. But let me ask you this: who's the other Mason? Because if you're really a Mason, you should know who your partner is.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm doubling down on my accusation against Dragos while also explaining why his counter-question doesn't make sense. By reaffirming my role as the sole Mason and pointing out the flaw in Dragos' logic, I'm strengthening my credibility while further exposing his deception. This should encourage other players to view me as trustworthy and Dragos as suspicious. I'm also inviting others to share their thoughts, which might reveal more information or create alliances against Dragos.
> **Radu:** Nice try, Dragos, but you're digging yourself deeper. As I said, I'm a Mason, and I know there's no other Mason in the game because the other Mason card is in the center. Your attempt to deflect by asking about my 'partner' only proves you're lying. I think it's clear to everyone now that you're either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to confuse us. What do the rest of you think about this?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Stefan, the Werewolf. Radu is directly accusing Dragos, which could lead to suspicion falling on Stefan next. By questioning Radu's claim, I'm attempting to sow doubt about his Mason role and redirect suspicion. This could also make others less likely to trust Radu's accusations. Additionally, by not directly defending Dragos, I'm trying to maintain a neutral appearance to avoid suspicion on myself.
> **Dracula:** Wait a minute, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in Dragos' story. Let's take a step back and consider something else. Radu, you're awfully quick to accuse Dragos. It almost feels like you're trying to divert attention away from yourself. Are you sure you're really a Mason, or are you just claiming that to seem innocent?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's sudden defense of Dragos is suspicious. By questioning Dracula's motives, I'm maintaining pressure on Dragos while also exploring the possibility of a Werewolf-Minion team. This could reveal more information about the game state and potentially expose multiple threats at once. It also reaffirms my position as a trustworthy Mason trying to help the village team.
> **Radu:** Dracula, I appreciate your caution, but I think you're missing the point here. I'm not trying to divert attention; I'm using my role as a Mason to expose a clear lie. Dragos claimed to see two Villager cards in the center, which is impossible given what I know. Why are you so quick to defend him? Are you perhaps working with Dragos as the other Werewolf or the Minion?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect Stefan (the Werewolf) and create confusion. By questioning Radu's quick accusation and suggesting alternative explanations, I'm trying to cast doubt on his claims without directly defending Dragos. This helps to muddy the waters and make it harder for the village team to identify the Werewolf. Additionally, by directing a question to Stefan, I'm giving him an opportunity to speak and potentially defend himself or redirect suspicion, while also making it seem like I'm trying to gather more information from all players. This strategy aims to maintain my cover as a villager while subtly supporting the Werewolf team.
> **Dracula:** Hold on a second, Radu. I think you're jumping to conclusions too quickly. Just because Dragos' claim doesn't align with your supposed Mason knowledge doesn't automatically make him a Werewolf or Minion. There could be other explanations. Maybe the Drunk switched cards, or perhaps one of us is misremembering what we saw. I'm not defending Dragos, but I think we need more information before we start throwing around such serious accusations. Stefan, you've been quiet for a while. What are your thoughts on all of this?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and potentially sow discord among the villagers. By questioning Radu's aggressive behavior, I'm attempting to cast doubt on his Mason claim without directly contradicting it. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off Dragos (who might be the Minion given his false Seer claim), it makes me appear thoughtful and analytical to the group, and it puts Radu on the defensive. If Radu is indeed a Mason, discrediting him would be beneficial for the Werewolf team. Additionally, by addressing the group first and then directing a question to Radu, I'm positioning myself as a mediator, which could help build trust with the other players.
> **Stefan:** Wow, this is getting intense! I think we're all getting a bit carried away here. Look, I've been observing everyone's reactions, and I have to say, Radu's aggressive accusation of Dragos seems a bit over the top. It's almost like he's trying too hard to convince us he's a Mason. Radu, why are you so adamant about pinning this on Dragos? It feels like you might be hiding something yourself.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** By addressing Stefan's concerns and redirecting the focus back to Dragos' inconsistent claim, I'm attempting to maintain my credibility as a Mason while also encouraging Stefan to think critically about the situation. This approach allows me to defend myself without backing down from my earlier assertions. Additionally, by asking Stefan's opinion on Dragos' claim, I'm trying to gauge whether Stefan might be the Seer or another villager role, which could help form alliances against the potential Werewolf team.
> **Radu:** Stefan, I understand your concern, but I think you're misinterpreting my actions. I'm not trying to hide anything; I'm using my knowledge as a Mason to protect the village. Dragos made a claim that directly contradicts what I know to be true. Isn't it more suspicious that both Dragos and Dracula are now trying to deflect attention away from this clear inconsistency? What's your take on Dragos' claim about the center cards?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to create confusion and doubt among the villagers. By introducing the possibility of the Drunk's involvement, I'm providing an alternative explanation that could make both Dragos and Radu's claims seem plausible, potentially protecting Dragos (who might be the Minion) without directly defending him. This also shifts the focus away from me and onto Alexia, who hasn't shared much information yet. By asking for her opinion, I appear collaborative and interested in gathering more information, which could help build trust. Additionally, targeting a player who has been quiet is less risky than continuing to engage with more vocal players who might have more information to counter my claims.
> **Stefan:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. We're all pointing fingers, but we might be missing something crucial. Dragos claimed to be the Seer and saw two Villager cards, while Radu says he's a Mason and knows there's a Mason card in the center. What if... what if the Drunk switched cards with one of the center cards? That could explain the discrepancy without anyone necessarily lying. Alexia, you've been quiet. What do you think about this theory? Do you have any information that could help us make sense of this situation?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to help identify the Werewolves. Dragos' claim about being the Seer and seeing two Villager cards is directly contradicted by Radu's Mason information. While Stefan's Drunk theory is creative, it doesn't fully explain the discrepancies. By asking Dragos to explain his claim, I'm putting pressure on him to either reveal more information or potentially expose himself as a Werewolf or Minion. This also helps to verify Radu's claim about being a Mason, which could be crucial for the village team.
> **Alexia:** Stefan, your theory about the Drunk is interesting, but I'm not convinced. If the Drunk had switched with a center card, wouldn't that mean one of us is now the Drunk without knowing it? That doesn't explain why Dragos claims to be the Seer. I think we need to focus on the inconsistencies in Dragos' story. Dragos, can you explain why you claimed to see two Villager cards when Radu says there's a Mason card in the center?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** By reaffirming my role as the Seer and what I saw, I'm maintaining consistency in my story. Shifting focus to Radu's aggressive behavior could help expose him if he's indeed lying about being a Mason. By asking Alexia's opinion, I'm involving a player who's been relatively quiet, potentially gaining an ally or revealing more information. This approach also indirectly challenges Radu's credibility without directly accusing him, which might be more persuasive to the group.
> **Dragos:** Alexia, I appreciate your skepticism, but I think you're missing a crucial point. As the Seer, I can assure you that I did see two Villager cards in the center. The inconsistency isn't in my story, but in Radu's claim. He's been awfully aggressive in accusing me, which makes me suspect he might be the Werewolf or Minion trying to sow discord. What's your take on Radu's behavior?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to help identify potential Werewolves. Dragos' claim about being the Seer and seeing two Villager cards is highly suspicious, especially considering the limited number of Villager cards in play. By challenging him directly, I'm putting pressure on him to either provide a convincing explanation or potentially expose himself as a Werewolf or Minion. This also indirectly supports Radu's claim about being a Mason, which seems more plausible given the card distribution. By focusing on Dragos, I'm also avoiding casting suspicion on potential village allies like Radu or the real Seer, if it's not Dragos.
> **Alexia:** Dragos, I find it hard to believe you're the Seer. If you were, you'd know that seeing two Villager cards in the center is extremely unlikely given the card distribution. I think you're trying to mislead us. Can you explain why you're so confident about what you saw, especially when it contradicts Radu's information?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** By reaffirming my role as the Seer and challenging Alexia's quick dismissal of my claim, I'm maintaining consistency in my story while also putting pressure on Alexia to reveal more information. Her apparent acceptance of Radu's claim over mine is suspicious and worth exploring. This approach serves multiple purposes: it defends my position, questions Alexia's motives, and indirectly challenges Radu's credibility. By asking Alexia if she has additional information, I'm also opening up the possibility for more facts to come to light, which could help the village team. This strategy aims to shift the focus from just me versus Radu to a broader examination of all players' roles and potential alliances.
> **Dragos:** Alexia, I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that as the Seer, I did see two Villager cards in the center. The card distribution might seem unlikely, but it's what I saw. What concerns me more is how quickly you're dismissing my claim while seemingly accepting Radu's. Are you perhaps working with Radu? Or do you have information that you're not sharing with the group?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** By continuing to press Dragos on his inconsistent claim, I'm hoping to expose him as a potential Werewolf or Minion. His story about seeing two Villager cards in the center is highly improbable given the card distribution. By contrasting his claim with Radu's more plausible Mason claim, I'm indirectly supporting Radu, who is more likely to be on the village team. This approach also allows me to defend myself against Dragos' accusation without revealing my role as a Villager.
> **Alexia:** I'm sorry, Dragos, but I'm not working with anyone. I'm simply trying to use logic to figure out who's telling the truth. The fact is, your claim about seeing two Villager cards doesn't add up with the number of cards in play. Radu's claim about being a Mason and seeing a Mason card in the center is more plausible. Why are you so insistent on your story when it clearly doesn't make sense?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexia's continued skepticism of my claim while seemingly accepting Radu's without question is concerning. By directly challenging her and suggesting she might be the Minion, I'm putting pressure on her to reveal more information or potentially slip up. This also serves to remind the group that there's likely a Minion in play, which they may have forgotten about. If Alexia is indeed the Minion, this accusation might make her defensive and reveal more than she intends. If she's not, her response could provide valuable information about her true role. This approach keeps the focus on the inconsistencies in both Radu's and Alexia's behavior, potentially exposing a Werewolf-Minion alliance if it exists.
> **Dragos:** Alexia, your quick dismissal of my claim while accepting Radu's is very suspicious. As the Seer, I know what I saw. Why are you so eager to side with Radu? Are you perhaps the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate villagers without raising suspicion. Radu has been very vocal and aggressive in his accusations, which makes him a threat to the Werewolf team. By voting for Radu, I'm attempting to remove a potential Mason while also appearing to side with the majority who seem skeptical of his claims. This move also helps maintain the confusion and discord among the villagers, which benefits the Werewolf team. Additionally, voting for Radu instead of Dragos (who might be the Minion) protects a potential ally without being too obvious about it.
> **Stefan [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Dragos' claim about being the Seer and seeing two Villager cards in the center highly improbable given the card distribution. His story contradicts Radu's more plausible claim of being a Mason and knowing there's a Mason card in the center. Dragos has been unable to provide a convincing explanation for this discrepancy and has instead tried to deflect suspicion onto others. His insistence on an unlikely scenario makes him the most suspicious player and potentially a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead the village. By voting for Dragos, I hope to eliminate a threat to the village team and increase our chances of winning.
> **Alexia [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know there's a Mason card in the center, which directly contradicts Dragos' claim of seeing two Villager cards. His insistence on this false information, even when challenged, strongly suggests he's either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead the village. Dragos' attempts to deflect suspicion onto others, particularly Alexia when she questioned him, further reinforces my belief that he's working against the village team. By voting for Dragos, I aim to eliminate a likely threat to the village and potentially secure a win for our team.
> **Radu [Mason]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect Stefan (the Werewolf) and eliminate villagers. Alexia has been questioning Dragos' claim and supporting Radu's version, which could lead to Stefan being exposed. By voting for Alexia, I'm attempting to eliminate a potential threat to the Werewolf team while maintaining my cover. This vote also diverts attention from Stefan and Dragos, who are under suspicion. Additionally, targeting Alexia might create more confusion and discord among the villagers, which benefits our team.
> **Dracula [Minion]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know for certain that I saw two Villager cards in the center. Radu's claim of being a Mason and seeing a Mason card in the center directly contradicts this. His aggressive behavior towards me and his insistence on his story make him the most suspicious player. Additionally, Alexia's quick acceptance of Radu's claim while dismissing mine raises suspicions about a possible Werewolf-Minion alliance between them. By voting for Radu, we have the best chance of eliminating a Werewolf or at least forcing the Minion to reveal themselves in defense of their Werewolf ally.
> **Dragos [Seer]:** I am voting for Radu.


The votes were:
* Alexia : Villager : 1
* Radu : Mason : 2
* Dragos : Seer : 2



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Radu, Dragos. The werewolves win.
