## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Viktor. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Dracula is a minion and is aware that Viktor is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Lucian. They are thinking about their action.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards provides more information overall. There's a good chance of uncovering a Werewolf or another powerful role, which can help me deduce the distribution of roles among the players. If I find a Werewolf in the center, I'll know there's only one Werewolf among the players, making it easier to identify them. Additionally, this information can be used to validate or challenge other players' claims during the day phase, giving me a strategic advantage without directly exposing another player's role.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, it's crucial to share this information early. Revealing that I saw a Villager and a Mason in the center narrows down the possible distributions of roles among the players. This information confirms that there's only one Werewolf in play, which is valuable for the village team. It also indirectly validates any Mason claims that might come up, as we know one Mason is in the center. By sharing this, I'm establishing my role as the Seer without directly claiming it, which adds credibility to my future statements and questions.
> **Lucian:** Hey everyone, I've got some interesting information to share. I saw two center cards last night, and they were a Villager and a Mason. This means there's definitely one Werewolf among us, and we need to figure out who it is.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to verify the authenticity of Lucian's claim. If he's telling the truth, he's a valuable ally. However, his statement could also be a clever ploy by a Werewolf to appear trustworthy. By questioning him directly, I hope to gauge his reaction and potentially expose any inconsistencies in his story. This could help identify if he's truly the Seer or possibly a Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Stefan:** Lucian, that's quite a claim you're making. How can we be sure you're really the Seer? It seems convenient that you'd reveal information that doesn't implicate yourself.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan's challenge to my claim needs to be addressed immediately. By turning the question back to him and asking for his role and actions, I'm putting him on the spot. This serves two purposes: it deflects suspicion from me and potentially reveals more information about Stefan's role. If he's a villager or Mason, he should be eager to confirm his innocence. If he hesitates or gives a vague answer, it might indicate he's the Werewolf or Minion trying to sow doubt about the Seer's information.
> **Lucian:** Stefan, I understand your skepticism, but think about it. If I wasn't the Seer, why would I risk making such a specific claim? It's not just convenient information; it's crucial for the village. Can you tell us what your role is and what you did last night?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm continuing to probe Lucian's claim of being the Seer. His initial response didn't fully address my concerns, so I'm asking for more specific details about his night action. If he's truly the Seer, he should be able to provide a logical explanation for his choices. This question also serves to gather more information that could be useful for the village team. If Lucian struggles to provide a convincing answer, it might indicate that he's actually a Werewolf trying to deceive us. However, I'm careful not to accuse him outright, as he could genuinely be our Seer and a valuable ally.
> **Stefan:** Lucian, I appreciate your explanation, but I'm still not entirely convinced. Can you tell us more about why you chose to look at the center cards instead of a player's card? That decision seems a bit odd to me.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan's continued skepticism is concerning. By explaining my strategy and then immediately turning the focus back on him, I'm maintaining my credibility while putting pressure on a potential threat. His reluctance to accept valuable information for the village team is suspicious and could indicate he's trying to protect himself as the Werewolf or Minion. By directly questioning his role and motives, I'm forcing him to either reveal information or appear more suspicious to the other players.
> **Lucian:** Stefan, I chose to look at the center cards because it gives us more information overall. Knowing there's a Mason and a Villager in the center tells us a lot about the game state. But let's focus on you for a moment. You seem awfully eager to cast doubt on my reveal. What's your role, and why are you so suspicious?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm addressing Lucian's accusation while maintaining my role as a Villager. By explaining my motivation for questioning him, I'm trying to appear transparent and trustworthy to the group. I'm also opening up the conversation to other players, which might help uncover more information or potential inconsistencies in other players' stories. This approach allows me to continue gathering information without directly accusing anyone, which is crucial since I don't have any special knowledge as a Villager.
> **Stefan:** Lucian, I understand your reasoning, but I'm just trying to get to the truth. As a Villager, I have no special information to share, which is why I'm asking questions. I'm not trying to cast suspicion on you; I'm trying to verify your claim for the good of the village. Can anyone else corroborate Lucian's story or share any other information?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather more information from other players. Dracula hasn't spoken yet, and his silence could be hiding valuable information or potential werewolf behavior. By directly asking him about his role and observations, I might be able to get some insight that could help identify the werewolf. Additionally, his response and body language might give us clues about his true allegiance.
> **Radu:** Dracula, you've been awfully quiet. What's your role, and did you notice anything suspicious during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect attention away from Viktor, the actual Werewolf. By claiming to be a Villager and expressing concern about Stefan, I'm attempting to cast suspicion on an innocent player while appearing helpful. Directing the question to Radu might make him feel involved and less likely to suspect me. This also helps to create division among the village team, which benefits the werewolf side.
> **Dracula:** Well, Radu, since you're asking, I'm actually a Villager too. I didn't notice anything suspicious during the night, but I'm getting increasingly worried about Stefan's behavior. He's been awfully quick to question Lucian's claim as the Seer, which seems like a classic werewolf tactic to me. What do you think about Stefan's actions so far?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's persistent questioning of Lucian, who claims to be the Seer, is concerning. As a Villager, I need to identify potential threats to the village. By directly confronting Stefan about his suspicious behavior, I might be able to provoke a reaction that could reveal his true intentions. If Stefan is indeed a Werewolf, putting him on the spot might cause him to slip up or provide inconsistent information. Additionally, by showing support for Lucian's claim, I'm aligning myself with a potential ally (the Seer) while also encouraging others to share their thoughts on Stefan's behavior.
> **Radu:** I agree with Dracula that Stefan's behavior is suspicious. Stefan, why are you so quick to doubt Lucian's claim as the Seer? It seems like you're trying to undermine valuable information for the village. Are you perhaps trying to protect yourself?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm addressing the accusations against me while redirecting suspicion towards Dracula and Radu. Their coordinated attack on me seems suspicious, especially since Dracula claims to be a Villager but hasn't contributed any valuable information. By questioning Dracula directly, I'm hoping to expose any inconsistencies in his story and potentially reveal a Werewolf alliance between him and Radu. This also serves to remind the group that we should be focusing on finding the Werewolves, not attacking those who are asking legitimate questions.
> **Stefan:** Look, I understand why my questions might seem suspicious, but I'm just trying to protect the village. Lucian's claim is crucial, and we need to be sure. Dracula and Radu, your sudden shift to accusing me feels off. Are you two working together? Dracula, you say you're a Villager too, but you've offered no useful information. Why is that?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to create confusion and misdirection while appearing helpful. By seemingly defending Stefan, I'm trying to gain his trust and potentially create doubt about Radu's accusation. At the same time, I'm subtly reinforcing Lucian's claim about the center cards, which could lead to identifying the Seer if someone contradicts this information. By asking about the Mason, I'm introducing a new element that could further complicate the discussion and potentially expose the real Mason or Seer, which would be beneficial for the Werewolf team. This approach allows me to appear constructive while actually hindering the village's progress in finding the Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** I think we're getting off track here. Stefan, I understand your skepticism, but constantly questioning Lucian isn't helping us find the Werewolf. And Radu, while I appreciate your concern, I don't think Stefan's behavior is necessarily suspicious. He's just being cautious. What we need to focus on is the information we have. Lucian's claim about the center cards is crucial. If there's a Mason in the center, that means there's only one Mason among us. Has anyone woken up as a Mason? This could help us verify Lucian's claim and narrow down our search for the Werewolf.


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Viktor, the Werewolf, while appearing to be helpful. By directing attention to Viktor's silence, I'm giving him an opportunity to speak and potentially clear himself. At the same time, I'm reinforcing Lucian's claim about the center cards, which could lead to identifying the real Seer if someone contradicts this information. Asking about the Mason adds another layer of complexity that could confuse the villagers. This approach allows me to seem proactive in the search for the Werewolf while actually hindering the village's progress.
> **Dracula:** Hey everyone, I've been thinking... Lucian's claim about the center cards is really important, but we might be overlooking something. If there's a Mason in the center, shouldn't the other Mason have spoken up by now? The silence is making me nervous. Viktor, you've been awfully quiet this whole time. What's your take on all of this? Do you have any information that could help us find the Werewolf?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Dracula's quick accusation of Stefan, I aim to divert suspicion from myself and sow doubt about Dracula, who could potentially be a Villager. This keeps the focus away from me while maintaining the appearance of contributing to the discussion.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone, I've got some thoughts to share. Lucian, if you're really the Seer, your claim about the center cards being a Villager and a Mason makes sense. But we need to consider all possibilities. If one of the Masons is in the center, the other should've spoken up by now. Dracula's been pretty quick to accuse Stefan, but without much evidence. I'm starting to feel like Dracula might be trying to divert attention away from himself. Dracula, can you explain why you're so sure Stefan is suspicious?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Viktor (the Werewolf) while appearing innocent. By turning Viktor's accusation back on him, I'm creating confusion and doubt among the villagers. This also gives Viktor an opportunity to defend himself and potentially clear his name. My goal is to create enough chaos that the villagers struggle to identify the real Werewolf. By asking Viktor about his role, I'm putting him on the spot in a way that seems natural and concerned, rather than protective. This approach allows me to continue appearing as a helpful Villager while actually working against the village's interests.
> **Dracula:** Hold on a second, Viktor. I think you're jumping to conclusions here. I wasn't accusing Stefan outright; I was just expressing concern about his initial skepticism towards Lucian's claim. If anything, your sudden attack on me seems more suspicious. Why are you so quick to point fingers at me when I've been trying to piece things together? And let's not forget, you've been awfully quiet until now. Care to explain what your role is and why you've been so silent?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question back to Dracula, I'm trying to keep the spotlight on him and away from myself. This also gives me a chance to gauge his response and see if he slips up, making him appear more suspicious to the others. Additionally, it keeps the conversation dynamic and prevents the focus from settling on me.
> **Viktor:** Alright, Dracula, you've been quick to point fingers at Stefan and now at me. If you're really a Villager, you should have nothing to hide. Can you tell us why you haven't offered any concrete information yourself? What did you do last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect suspicion away from Viktor (the Werewolf) while maintaining my cover as a Villager. By turning Viktor's accusation back on him and questioning his silence, I'm creating doubt about his intentions without directly accusing him of being a Werewolf. This approach serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear proactive and concerned for the village, it puts pressure on Viktor to defend himself (giving him an opportunity to clear his name), and it creates more confusion among the other players. By asking Viktor about his role, I'm also subtly fishing for information that could be useful to our team. Overall, this strategy aims to muddy the waters and make it harder for the village to identify the true Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting sidetracked here. Viktor's sudden accusation against me is a classic misdirection tactic. I've been trying to piece things together this whole time, while Viktor has been silent until now. That's far more suspicious than anything I've done. Viktor, if you're so eager to point fingers, why don't you tell us what your role is and what you've been doing this whole time? Your silence and then sudden aggression are raising some serious red flags for me.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Lucian's choice to look at the center cards, I aim to cast doubt on his claim as the Seer without directly accusing him. This keeps the focus on Lucian and away from myself while maintaining the appearance of contributing to the discussion.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's not get sidetracked. I think we need to focus on Lucian's claim as the Seer. If he's telling the truth, then knowing there's a Villager and a Mason in the center helps us narrow down the possibilities. But if he's lying, then he's most likely a Werewolf trying to mislead us. Lucian, can you explain why you chose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card?


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor's sudden interest in questioning my decision as the Seer is suspicious, especially after being quiet for most of the game. By turning the question back on him and suggesting he might be the Werewolf, I'm putting him on the defensive and potentially revealing more information about his role. This also shifts the focus from me to Viktor, which could help protect me if other players are starting to doubt my claim. Additionally, by reaffirming my reasoning for looking at the center cards, I'm maintaining consistency in my story, which adds to my credibility as the Seer.
> **Lucian:** Viktor, I've already explained my reasoning for looking at the center cards. It gives us more overall information about the game state. What's more concerning is your sudden interest in questioning me after being silent for so long. Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to cast doubt on the Seer's information?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Stefan directly, I aim to keep the suspicion on him and away from myself. Additionally, pushing for more information from Stefan can help create doubt about his motives if he hesitates or gives an unclear answer.
> **Viktor:** Alright, we need to focus here and think this through logically. Lucian, you're claiming to be the Seer and you've seen a Villager and a Mason in the center. This means there's a good chance the other Mason is among us. If that's true, we should hear from the Mason who woke up and didn't see another Mason. That would help verify your claim and give us more certainty. Stefan, you've been the most skeptical about Lucian's claim. Why don't you tell us what you did last night and what your role is?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's sudden interest in questioning me after being silent is concerning. He's trying to put me on the defensive, which could be a tactic to divert attention from himself. By turning the question back on him, I'm hoping to expose any inconsistencies in his story or force him to reveal information that could help the village. This also serves to remind the group that Viktor hasn't contributed much to the discussion until now, which is suspicious behavior.
> **Stefan:** Viktor, I find it suspicious that you're suddenly so interested in my actions when you've been quiet this whole time. Why don't you tell us what your role is and what you did last night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I've provided valuable information about the center cards, which Viktor has suspiciously questioned after being silent for most of the game. His sudden interest in my decision-making and his refusal to reveal his own role raise red flags. Given that we know there's one Werewolf among us, and Viktor's behavior aligns with typical Werewolf tactics of casting doubt on key village roles, he seems the most likely candidate for the Werewolf. By voting for Viktor, I'm hoping to eliminate the greatest threat to the village team and secure a win for us.
> **Lucian [Seer]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Viktor's behavior the most suspicious. He remained silent for most of the game and then suddenly became very active, questioning others aggressively. His late entry into the discussion and attempt to redirect suspicion onto me when I questioned him seems like a classic Werewolf tactic. While Lucian's claim as the Seer is still not fully verified, Viktor's actions seem more immediately concerning. By voting for Viktor, I hope to either eliminate a potential Werewolf or, at the very least, force him to reveal more information that could help the village team.
> **Stefan [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Viktor's behavior the most suspicious. He remained silent for most of the game and then suddenly became very active, questioning others aggressively. This could be a tactic to divert attention from himself. Additionally, he's been quick to cast doubt on Lucian's claim as the Seer, which could be an attempt to undermine valuable information for the village. While Stefan and Dracula have also shown some suspicious behavior, Viktor's late involvement and targeted questioning make him the most likely candidate for the Werewolf in my opinion.
> **Radu [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I know Viktor is the Werewolf, so I need to protect him. By voting for Viktor, I'm attempting to appear as a concerned villager while actually creating chaos. This vote might make others doubt my earlier defense of Viktor, potentially leading them to suspect me instead. This confusion could help Viktor avoid being eliminated, which is my main goal as the Minion. Additionally, if others follow my vote, it might trigger Viktor to defend himself more vigorously, potentially casting suspicion on other players and further muddying the waters.
> **Dracula [Minion]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian's claim as the Seer and his choice to look at the center cards is suspicious, especially since no one has corroborated seeing the other Mason. By voting for Lucian, I aim to cast doubt on his claim and protect myself as the Werewolf.
> **Viktor [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Seer : 1
* Viktor : Werewolf : 4



>***GAME:*** Viktor was killed. The villagers win.
