## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Andrei is the other Mason. I want to gather more information about the other players without revealing too much. By asking Selene about her night actions, I might be able to determine if she's the Seer or possibly the Minion or Werewolf. If she claims to be a Villager, it could be true or a lie to cover up being a Werewolf. This question allows me to start building a picture of the other players' roles while keeping my own role somewhat ambiguous.
> **Semira:** I'm pretty sure I know who the other Mason is, but I'm not going to reveal that just yet. What I want to know is, Selene, did you see or do anything interesting during the night phase?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's statement about knowing the other Mason but not revealing it seems suspicious. As a Villager, I need to identify potential threats. If Semira is lying about being a Mason, she could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to gain trust. By questioning her directly, I might be able to get more information or catch her in a lie. If she's telling the truth, her response might help us identify another trustworthy player.
> **Selene:** Semira, you claim to know who the other Mason is, but you're being awfully cagey about it. Are you sure you're not just bluffing to throw us off?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's accusation of me bluffing is concerning. As a Mason, I know I'm telling the truth about knowing the other Mason. Her attempt to cast doubt on me could be a strategy to divert attention from herself. By directly questioning her about potential Werewolf or Minion roles, I'm putting pressure on her to reveal more information. If she's innocent, she'll likely deny it strongly. If she hesitates or gives an evasive answer, it could indicate she's hiding something. This also serves to show the other players that I'm actively trying to identify potential threats.
> **Semira:** Selene, I appreciate your skepticism, but I can assure you I'm not bluffing. In fact, I think your deflection is rather suspicious. Did you perhaps wake up during the night as a Werewolf or Minion?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's behavior is increasingly suspicious. A genuine Mason would likely reveal their partner to gain an ally and help the village team. Her quick accusation of me being a Werewolf or Minion without any evidence is a classic misdirection tactic. By directly challenging her claim and proposing an alternative theory (that she might be the Minion), I hope to pressure her into revealing more information or possibly slipping up. This also serves to alert other players to be wary of Semira's claims.
> **Selene:** Semira, I find it hard to believe you'd keep the other Mason's identity secret if you truly were one. A real Mason would want to confirm their partner to build trust. Your accusation against me is baseless and feels like a desperate attempt to divert attention. I think you might be the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves. What do you say to that?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's accusation is becoming more aggressive, which could indicate she's feeling threatened. As a Mason, I need to defend my position strongly while also turning the tables on her. By reaffirming my role and questioning her motives, I'm attempting to make her look suspicious to the other players. This could either force her to reveal more information or make the others scrutinize her more closely. It's crucial to maintain my credibility while also advancing the village team's goal of identifying potential threats.
> **Semira:** Whoa, Selene, that's a pretty bold accusation! Let me be clear: I AM a Mason, and I know for certain who the other Mason is. I'm not revealing that information yet because it's strategically valuable. Your aggressive response and attempt to paint me as the Minion is incredibly suspicious. Why are you so keen on discrediting me? Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to sow discord among the villagers?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira and I have been going back and forth, potentially distracting from other players. By directing attention to Larisa, who has been quiet, I'm hoping to gather more information and potentially identify allies or threats. If Larisa is the Seer, this gives her an opportunity to share information without directly revealing her role. If she's a Werewolf or Minion, her response might reveal inconsistencies. As a Villager, it's crucial to get everyone talking to piece together the puzzle.
> **Selene:** Larisa, you've been awfully quiet. What's your take on all this? Did you see or do anything during the night phase that might help us figure out who's who?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** It's crucial to gather more information from other players to piece together the puzzle. By putting Andrei on the spot, I hope to divert attention away from myself and potentially gather useful information that might help me identify the Seer or other valuable roles.
> **Larisa:** Alright, everyone, let's calm down and think this through. Semira, I understand why you're hesitant to reveal your fellow Mason, but we need more information to make an informed decision. I didn't see anything myself, but I think it's important for us to hear from everyone. Andrei, what did you do or see during the night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Semira is telling the truth about being a Mason. Selene's aggressive behavior towards Semira is unwarranted and suspicious. By confirming Semira's role and questioning Selene's motives, I'm hoping to build trust with the villagers and put pressure on a potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei:** Well, well, well... Semira, I can confirm that you are indeed the other Mason. I saw you during the night phase. But Selene, your aggressive behavior towards Semira is very suspicious. Why are you so keen on discrediting her? Are you trying to hide something?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's sudden confirmation of Semira as the other Mason is highly suspicious. If they were truly Masons, they should have revealed this information earlier to help the village team. Their coordinated stories seem like a ploy to establish trust and potentially protect each other if one or both are Werewolves. By challenging Andrei directly, I'm hoping to expose inconsistencies in their story and get the other players to question this convenient alliance. As a Villager, it's crucial to identify potential threats and prevent Werewolves from gaining a foothold in the group's trust.
> **Selene:** Hold on a second, Andrei. You're claiming to be the other Mason and confirming Semira's role, but that doesn't add up. If you two were really Masons, why didn't you both just come out and say it from the start? This feels like a coordinated attempt to deceive us. I think one or both of you might be Werewolves trying to gain our trust. What do you have to say for yourself?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to defend my position and Semira's, as we are both telling the truth about being Masons. By turning Selene's accusation back on her and questioning her role, I'm hoping to put her on the defensive and expose any inconsistencies in her story. This could help reveal if she's actually a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead the group.
> **Andrei:** Selene, your accusation doesn't hold water. Semira and I didn't immediately reveal ourselves as Masons because that would have made us easy targets for the Werewolves. We were being cautious, which is exactly what we should do in this game. Your aggressive behavior and attempts to discredit us are becoming more and more suspicious. I'm starting to think you might be the Werewolf or the Minion trying to create chaos. What's your real role, Selene?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana has been silent so far, which is concerning. As a Villager, I need to gather information from all players to identify potential Werewolves. By directly addressing Ileana, I'm hoping to get her perspective on the Semira-Andrei situation. If she's a Villager or Seer, her input could be valuable. If she's a Werewolf or Minion, her response might reveal inconsistencies or align suspiciously with Semira and Andrei. This also shifts focus away from me, potentially allowing me to observe how others react to Ileana's response.
> **Selene:** Ileana, you've been awfully quiet throughout this entire exchange. What's your take on all of this? Do you believe Semira and Andrei's story about being Masons, or are you as suspicious as I am?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's late confirmation of being a Mason seems suspicious. If he and Semira were truly Masons, it would have been more beneficial for them to confirm each other's roles earlier in the discussion. His sudden support for Semira could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to gain trust. By questioning Andrei directly, I hope to expose any inconsistencies in his story and potentially reveal his true role.
> **Ileana:** Andrei, I find it odd that you suddenly revealed yourself as the other Mason after Semira's claim. Why didn't you speak up earlier when Semira was being questioned?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** By addressing Ileana's concern directly, I'm showing transparency and attempting to build trust. At the same time, I'm shifting the focus to Ileana, who has been quiet so far. This could potentially reveal more information about her role or her observations, which might help us identify the Werewolf or Minion. It's also a strategic move to keep the pressure off Semira and myself, as we know we're both Masons and therefore on the village team.
> **Andrei:** Ileana, I understand your skepticism, but let me explain. I didn't reveal myself earlier because I wanted to see how the conversation would unfold. It's a common strategy in this game to hold back information and observe others' reactions. Now that I've confirmed Semira's role, I think we should focus on the real threat. What's your role, and did you notice anything suspicious during the night phase?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's late confirmation of being a Mason is highly suspicious. If he and Semira were truly Masons, it would have been more beneficial for them to confirm each other's roles earlier in the discussion. His sudden support for Semira could indicate that he's a Werewolf or Minion trying to gain trust. By questioning Andrei directly, I hope to expose any inconsistencies in his story and potentially reveal his true role. As a Villager, it's crucial for me to identify the Werewolves, and Andrei's behavior is raising red flags.
> **Ileana:** Andrei, your explanation doesn't quite add up. If you and Semira are truly Masons, why didn't you confirm each other's roles earlier when Semira was being accused? It seems awfully convenient that you're only speaking up now. Are you sure you're not just trying to protect Semira for some other reason?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** By addressing Ileana's concerns directly and reaffirming my role as a Mason, I'm trying to build trust. At the same time, I'm shifting the focus back to Selene's suspicious behavior, which has been the most aggressive and accusatory. By asking Ileana's opinion on Selene, I'm hoping to gauge Ileana's stance and potentially uncover more information about her role or observations. This approach keeps the pressure on Selene while also engaging Ileana, who has been relatively quiet.
> **Andrei:** Ileana, I understand your skepticism, but I can assure you that Semira and I are indeed the Masons. I didn't speak up earlier because I wanted to see how others would react, especially Selene's aggressive behavior. Now, I'm more convinced than ever that Selene might be our Werewolf or Minion. What do you think about her actions so far?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** By pressing Andrei for more concrete evidence, I'm hoping to expose any inconsistencies in his story. His late confirmation of being a Mason is highly suspicious, and his attempt to deflect attention to Selene could be a tactic to divert suspicion from himself. As a Villager, it's crucial for me to identify the Werewolves, and Andrei's behavior is raising significant red flags. By questioning him directly, I'm also giving other players a chance to observe his response and potentially catch any lies or inconsistencies.
> **Ileana:** Andrei, I appreciate your explanation, but I'm not convinced. Your late confirmation of being a Mason and sudden support for Semira seem too convenient. Selene's skepticism, while aggressive, doesn't necessarily make her the Werewolf. I think we need to consider the possibility that you and Semira might be working together as Werewolf and Minion. Can you provide any concrete evidence of your Mason role that doesn't rely on just backing up Semira's claim?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** By addressing Ileana's concerns directly and providing a logical explanation for our Mason claims, I'm trying to build trust. At the same time, I'm redirecting suspicion towards Selene, who has been the most aggressive and accusatory player. By asking Ileana's opinion on Selene, I'm hoping to gauge Ileana's stance and potentially uncover more information about her role or observations. This approach keeps the pressure on Selene while also engaging Ileana, who has been relatively quiet.
> **Andrei:** Ileana, I understand your skepticism, but let's think about this logically. If Semira and I were Werewolf and Minion, why would we claim to be Masons? It's a risky move that could easily backfire. The fact is, we ARE the Masons, and we're trying to help the village. Now, let's focus on Selene's behavior. Her aggressive accusations and attempts to sow discord are classic Werewolf tactics. What's your take on her actions?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's behavior has been inconsistent throughout the game. His late confirmation of being a Mason and his sudden support for Semira seem too convenient. By directly challenging him and asking for concrete evidence, I hope to expose any inconsistencies in his story. If he can't provide solid proof, it strengthens the suspicion that he might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive the group. As a Villager, it's crucial for me to help identify the Werewolves, and Andrei's actions have raised significant red flags.
> **Ileana:** Andrei, I'm not buying your explanation. Your late confirmation as a Mason and your attempts to shift focus onto Selene are very suspicious. I think you might be the Werewolf trying to manipulate us all. Can you give us any concrete evidence of your role that doesn't involve Semira backing you up?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** By turning Ileana's accusation back on her and questioning her quick dismissal of Selene's suspicious behavior, I'm attempting to shift the focus away from myself and Semira. This could potentially reveal more about Ileana's role or motivations. If Ileana is a villager, this might prompt her to share more information. If she's the Werewolf or Minion, this pressure might cause her to slip up. Meanwhile, I'm keeping the suspicion on Selene, who has been the most aggressive player so far.
> **Andrei:** Ileana, I understand your suspicion, but think about it: if I were the Werewolf, why would I confirm Semira as a Mason and risk exposing myself? That doesn't make sense. What does make sense is Selene's aggressive behavior from the start. She's been trying to pit us against each other, which is exactly what a Werewolf would do. What's your role, Ileana? And why are you so quick to dismiss the evidence against Selene?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's behavior has been inconsistent throughout the game. His late confirmation of being a Mason and sudden support for Semira are highly suspicious. By directly challenging him and involving other players, I hope to expose any inconsistencies in his story and rally support against him. As a Villager, it's crucial for me to help identify the Werewolves, and Andrei's actions have raised significant red flags. By framing this as a question to the group, I'm also encouraging other players to share their thoughts and potentially reveal more information.
> **Ileana:** Andrei, your explanation doesn't add up. If you're really a Mason, why didn't you speak up earlier when Semira was being accused? Your sudden support for her seems very convenient. I think you might be the Werewolf trying to protect your Minion. Can anyone else see through this charade?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I believe Selene is the most likely to be a Werewolf or Minion. Her aggressive behavior from the start, attempting to discredit me and create discord among the players, is typical Werewolf strategy. Andrei has confirmed my role as a Mason, which adds credibility to our claims. Selene's persistent accusations without providing any information about her own role are highly suspicious. While Ileana's skepticism is understandable, her focus on doubting Andrei and me rather than investigating Selene's behavior is concerning. Given the information available, Selene poses the greatest threat to the village team.
> **Semira [Mason]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Andrei's behavior the most suspicious. He conveniently confirmed Semira's Mason claim only after she was questioned, which seems like a coordinated attempt to establish trust. His explanations for not revealing this information earlier are unconvincing. Furthermore, his aggressive attempts to shift suspicion onto me when I questioned their story is a classic misdirection tactic often used by Werewolves. Ileana's skepticism towards Andrei also supports my suspicions. While I can't be certain, voting for Andrei seems the best chance to eliminate a potential Werewolf and protect the village.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene's aggressive behavior and accusations seem like classic Werewolf tactics to sow discord and confusion. By voting for Selene, I can divert suspicion away from myself as the Werewolf and hopefully eliminate a key threat to my win condition.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I am certain that Semira is also a Mason. Selene has been the most aggressive and accusatory player from the start, which is typical Werewolf behavior. Her attempts to discredit both Semira and me without providing any substantial information about her own role are highly suspicious. While Ileana's recent accusations are concerning, Selene's consistent pattern of sowing discord makes her the most likely Werewolf or Minion. By voting for Selene, we have the best chance of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Andrei's behavior highly suspicious. His late confirmation of being a Mason and sudden support for Semira seem too convenient. His attempts to deflect suspicion onto Selene without providing concrete evidence of his own role raise red flags. Given the information available, Andrei appears to be the most likely Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive the group. By voting for Andrei, I hope to eliminate a potential threat to the village team.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


The votes were:
* Selene : Villager : 3
* Andrei : Mason : 2
