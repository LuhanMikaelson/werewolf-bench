## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Cristina. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Andrei is a minion and is aware that Cristina is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Alexandra and Michael. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dracula. They are thinking about their action.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I think it's more valuable to look at another player's card rather than the center cards. By checking a player's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or confirm a villager role. I'm choosing Alexandra because she's the first player alphabetically, and without any prior information, this choice is as good as any. If she turns out to be a Werewolf or Minion, it will be crucial information for the village team. If she's a villager or another beneficial role, I can use this information to build trust and alliances during the day phase.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know that Michael is the other Mason. By openly confirming this, we can establish trust with each other and potentially with the other villagers. This also indirectly reveals our roles, which might help the Seer or other villagers to focus their suspicions elsewhere. However, it does put a target on our backs for the Werewolves, so we'll need to be cautious.
> **Alexandra:** Hey Michael, I saw you during the night phase. We're both Masons, right? Let's work together to find the Werewolves!


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm confirming our alliance as Masons to build trust with Alexandra and the group. By mentioning Dracula's silence, I'm subtly casting suspicion on him while also inviting Alexandra to share her thoughts. This helps us appear as a united front working for the village team, and might prompt Dracula to defend himself, potentially revealing more information.
> **Michael:** Alexandra, I can confirm that we're both Masons. Now, let's focus on finding the Werewolves. Dracula has been awfully quiet. What do you think about him?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael has raised a valid point about Dracula's silence. As Masons, Michael and I have already established our roles, so it's crucial to gather information from other players. By directly questioning Dracula, we can observe his reaction and potentially catch any inconsistencies in his story. If he claims to be a Villager, it might be suspicious since Villagers don't wake up at night. If he claims to be the Seer or Minion, we'll need to scrutinize his response carefully. This direct approach might also pressure the real Werewolf or Minion into making a mistake.
> **Alexandra:** Dracula, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have valuable information that can help the village team. By confirming Alexandra's role, I'm establishing trust and potentially creating an alliance with both Alexandra and Michael. This also indirectly confirms Michael's claim of being a Mason, as there are two Mason cards in the game. By revealing this information early, I'm hoping to narrow down the potential Werewolves and guide the village team's suspicions towards the other players.
> **Dracula:** I can confirm that Alexandra is indeed a Mason. I used my Seer ability to look at her card during the night phase.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I've already confirmed Alexandra's role as a Mason, which indirectly confirms Michael's claim. By asking about Cristina and Andrei's roles, I'm trying to gather more information and potentially identify the Werewolf or Minion. Their responses and behavior could provide valuable clues. If either of them hesitates or gives a vague answer, it might raise suspicion. On the other hand, if they claim to be Villagers or have clear roles, it could help us narrow down the possibilities for the remaining roles in the center.
> **Dracula:** Cristina and Andrei, you've both been quiet so far. Can either of you share what role you woke up as last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's claim to be the Seer is highly suspicious. As a Mason, I know there are two Mason cards in play (Alexandra and myself), which leaves only one special role card besides the Werewolf and Minion. It's more likely that the remaining special role is a Villager, and Dracula is lying to appear innocent. By challenging him directly, I hope to expose his deception and gather more information from his response and the reactions of other players.
> **Michael:** Dracula, I find it suspicious that you claim to be the Seer when Alexandra and I are confirmed Masons. Are you trying to mislead us?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to address Michael's accusation directly to maintain my credibility as the Seer. By explaining my night action and how it corroborates their Mason claims, I'm reinforcing my role while also redirecting suspicion towards the quiet players. This approach aims to build trust with the confirmed Masons and encourages them to work with me in identifying the Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Michael, I understand your suspicion, but I assure you I am indeed the Seer. I chose to look at Alexandra's card during the night phase, which is how I confirmed she's a Mason. This actually supports your claim of being a Mason as well. I'm trying to help the village team by sharing this information. Now, let's focus on finding the Werewolf. What are your thoughts on Cristina and Andrei's silence?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly confronting Dracula and pointing out the logical inconsistency in his claim, I'm hoping to pressure him into revealing more information or contradicting himself. This also serves to alert the other players to the possibility that Dracula is lying, potentially uniting the village team against him. Additionally, by mentioning the possibility of him being either the Werewolf or Minion, I'm indirectly prompting other players to consider these roles and potentially reveal information about their own roles in response.
> **Michael:** I'm getting really suspicious of you, Dracula. Your claim about being the Seer doesn't add up. If Alexandra and I are Masons, and you're the Seer, that leaves only one special role card. It's more likely you're lying to cover up being the Werewolf or Minion. What do you have to say for yourself?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to defend my position as the Seer while also redirecting suspicion towards the quiet players. By explaining the possibility of the Werewolf card being in the center, I'm countering Michael's logic and maintaining my credibility. This approach aims to shift the focus back to finding the actual threats while encouraging cooperation among the confirmed roles.
> **Dracula:** Michael, I understand your suspicion, but you're missing a crucial point. There are three cards in the center that we haven't seen. One of those could easily be the Werewolf card, which explains why there's still a Minion role available. My role as Seer is vital for the village, and I've already provided valuable information by confirming Alexandra's role. Instead of accusing me, we should focus on Cristina and Andrei, who have been suspiciously quiet. What are your thoughts on their silence?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's attempt to deflect suspicion onto Cristina and Andrei is worth investigating. By directly questioning Cristina, I'm hoping to gather more information and potentially expose another lie or contradiction. This also serves to show that I'm actively working to uncover the truth, reinforcing my credibility as a Mason. If Cristina provides a believable answer, it could help narrow down the possibilities for the Werewolf and Minion roles. If she's evasive or lies, it might indicate that she's one of the werewolf team members.
> **Michael:** Cristina, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night? Your silence is making me very suspicious.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I'm trying to divert suspicion away from myself by getting more players involved. By questioning Andrei, I can gather more information and potentially find inconsistencies in others' statements. This will help me build a case against someone else without drawing attention to myself.
> **Cristina:** Alright, everyone, let's break this down. Alexandra and Michael are claiming to be Masons and supporting each other. Dracula claims to be the Seer and says he saw Alexandra's card and confirmed she's a Mason. However, I find it interesting that Dracula is trying to point fingers at me and Andrei without much evidence. Andrei, we haven't heard from you yet. What role did you wake up as?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I know Cristina is the Werewolf, so I need to protect her. By directing attention back to her but in a way that seems like I'm just being cautious, I can give her an opportunity to defend herself without seeming like I'm allied with her. This also helps maintain my cover as a potential villager, as I'm actively participating in the discussion and questioning others. Additionally, by engaging with Cristina, I'm indirectly supporting Dracula's earlier point about our silence, which might help take some heat off him as he's not a Werewolf and could be a useful ally in confusing the villagers.
> **Andrei:** Whoa, hold on a second! Everyone's pointing fingers, but we're missing something important here. Cristina, you've been awfully quiet, and now you're suddenly trying to deflect attention onto me? That's pretty suspicious if you ask me. Why don't you tell us what role you woke up as last night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Andrei's sudden accusation feels like a classic deflection tactic. By putting him on the spot and asking him to elaborate on his role, I'm attempting to shift the suspicion back onto him and alleviate the pressure on myself. Plus, staying proactive in the conversation helps me appear more credible.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, I think you're trying to deflect the attention away from yourself by accusing me. I woke up as a Villager, and it's quite convenient that you've stayed silent until now. Why don't you tell us more about your role?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Cristina (the Werewolf) while appearing to contribute to the village's cause. By casting doubt on Dracula's claim, I'm redirecting suspicion away from Cristina and myself. This also helps create confusion among the villagers, making it harder for them to identify the true Werewolf. Additionally, by pointing out the logical inconsistency in the role distribution, I'm presenting myself as an observant and thoughtful player, which aligns with how a villager might behave.
> **Andrei:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting sidetracked here. Cristina's sudden accusation towards me is a classic misdirection tactic. I've been observing and thinking carefully before speaking. Now, let's focus on something important: Dracula claimed to be the Seer and confirmed Alexandra as a Mason, right? But if Alexandra and Michael are both Masons, and Dracula is the Seer, that leaves only one special role card for the rest of us. Doesn't that seem odd to anyone else? I think we should be more suspicious of Dracula's claim. What if he's actually the Werewolf trying to gain our trust?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing the group and questioning the validity of Dracula's claim, I can sow doubt about his role while also casting suspicion on Andrei. This helps divert attention away from myself and aligns with my goal of creating confusion among the Villagers. Additionally, being proactive in the discussion makes me appear more credible and involved.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, let's take a moment to think this through. Alexandra and Michael claim to be Masons, and Dracula says he's the Seer who confirmed Alexandra. But there's something fishy about Dracula's claim. If he's the Seer and saw Alexandra's card, why is he so quick to point fingers without solid evidence? Andrei, you've been quiet for most of the discussion and only spoke up when I called you out. That seems like classic deflection to me.


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Cristina (the Werewolf) while appearing to contribute to the village's cause. By casting doubt on Dracula's claim, I'm redirecting suspicion away from Cristina and myself. This also helps create confusion among the villagers, making it harder for them to identify the true Werewolf. Additionally, by pointing out the logical inconsistency in Dracula's behavior, I'm presenting myself as an observant and thoughtful player, which aligns with how a villager might behave. This strategy aims to keep the focus on Dracula, who isn't a Werewolf, while subtly defending Cristina without appearing too obvious about it.
> **Andrei:** Hey everyone, I think we're getting too caught up in accusations without solid evidence. Let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Alexandra and Michael claim to be Masons, which could be true. But Dracula's claim of being the Seer doesn't add up. If he really saw Alexandra's card, why is he so quick to point fingers at others without any proof? That's not how a true Seer would act. I think we should be more careful about trusting Dracula's words. What if he's actually the Werewolf trying to mislead us?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei has been quiet for most of the game and only spoke up when accused. His sudden focus on Dracula could be a tactic to divert attention from himself. As a Mason, I need to be wary of players who might be Werewolves or the Minion. Andrei's behavior is suspicious, and by questioning him directly, I might be able to provoke a reaction that reveals more about his true role. Additionally, this keeps the pressure on potential Werewolves while indirectly supporting Dracula, who claimed to confirm my role as Mason.
> **Alexandra:** Hold on a second, Andrei! You're suddenly very vocal about Dracula being suspicious, but you've been quiet this whole time. That seems pretty convenient to me. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Cristina (the Werewolf) while appearing to contribute to the village's cause. By redirecting Alexandra's suspicion towards Dracula, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) Keeping the focus off Cristina and myself, 2) Creating doubt about Dracula's role, which adds confusion and helps the Werewolf team, 3) Presenting myself as a logical thinker who's trying to help the village, which aligns with how a villager might behave. This approach also allows me to engage with Alexandra directly, potentially swaying her opinion and creating more chaos among the villagers.
> **Andrei:** Hey Alexandra, I understand your suspicion, but let's think about this logically. I've been quiet because I've been carefully observing everyone's behavior. Dracula's claim about being the Seer is what really doesn't add up here. If he truly saw your card, why is he so quick to accuse others without any real evidence? That's not how a genuine Seer would act. Don't you think it's more likely that Dracula is the Werewolf trying to gain our trust?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's behavior is highly suspicious. He was quiet for most of the game and only became vocal when accused. His sudden attack on Dracula, who claimed to confirm my role as Mason, could be a tactic to divert attention from himself. By directly challenging Andrei, I'm hoping to provoke a reaction that might reveal more about his true role. This also indirectly supports Dracula, who, if telling the truth, is a valuable ally for the village team. As a Mason, it's crucial to identify potential threats to the village, and Andrei's behavior fits that profile.
> **Alexandra:** Andrei, I appreciate your attempt at logic, but your sudden focus on Dracula seems like a classic misdirection. You've been silent until now, and suddenly you're an expert on how a Seer should act? That's pretty convenient timing. Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to throw us off your scent?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to create confusion and protect Cristina, the Werewolf. By suggesting that the Werewolf might be in the center, I'm introducing doubt and potentially steering the conversation away from player accusations. Targeting Michael, one of the claimed Masons, serves two purposes: it makes me appear engaged and logical, like a concerned villager, while also potentially creating discord between the two claimed Masons. If Michael disagrees with this possibility, it could cast doubt on his claim. If he agrees, it might make Alexandra suspicious of him. Either way, it helps to create more chaos and confusion, benefiting the Werewolf team.
> **Andrei:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting too caught up in personal accusations. Let's take a step back and look at the facts. We have two claimed Masons, a claimed Seer, and the rest of us. What if the Werewolf is actually in the center, and we're all just running in circles? I think we need to consider that possibility before we start pointing fingers. Michael, as one of the claimed Masons, what are your thoughts on this? Do you think it's possible we're overlooking something important?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I find Andrei's behavior highly suspicious. He remained silent for most of the game and only became vocal when accused, suddenly attacking Dracula who had confirmed my role. This seems like a classic misdirection tactic. His attempt to shift focus to the possibility of the Werewolf being in the center feels like a last-ditch effort to avoid suspicion. Given the limited information we have, Andrei's actions align most closely with what we'd expect from a Werewolf or Minion trying to confuse the village team.
> **Alexandra [Mason]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have confirmed Alexandra's role as a Mason, which indirectly supports Michael's claim. Andrei has been suspiciously quiet for most of the game and only became vocal when accused. His sudden focus on discrediting me seems like a classic Werewolf tactic to create doubt and chaos. While Cristina has also been quiet, Andrei's behavior is more concerning. By voting for Andrei, we have the best chance of eliminating a potential threat to the village team.
> **Dracula [Seer]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I believe Dracula is the most suspicious player. His claim to be the Seer doesn't align with the known roles in play. With Alexandra and myself as Masons, it's highly unlikely that Dracula is also a special role. His attempts to deflect suspicion and lack of substantial information make him the most likely candidate for either the Werewolf or Minion. By voting for Dracula, we have the best chance of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Michael [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's claim of being the Seer and confirming Alexandra as a Mason is suspicious because it doesn't align with the already confirmed roles of Alexandra and Michael as Masons. It seems more likely that Dracula is trying to mislead the group, possibly as the Minion or even the Werewolf. By voting for Dracula, I can help divert suspicion from myself and create confusion among the Villagers.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect Cristina (the Werewolf) and create confusion among the villagers. Voting for Dracula serves multiple purposes: 1) It maintains my cover as a potential villager by acting on the suspicions I've raised about him. 2) It diverts attention away from Cristina. 3) It eliminates a non-Werewolf player, which benefits our team. 4) If Dracula is indeed the Seer, eliminating him removes a threat to our team. This vote aligns with my previous arguments and doesn't raise suspicion about my true role.
> **Andrei [Minion]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Dracula : Seer : 3
* Andrei : Minion : 2



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
