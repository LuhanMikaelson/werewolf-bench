## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to start gathering information. Mircea hasn't said much, which could be suspicious. By directly asking about their role, I might be able to catch them off guard if they're a Werewolf. If they claim to be a Villager like me, I'll need to assess their reaction. If they claim a special role, it could help us identify potential allies or threats.
> **Lucian:** Hey Mircea, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know I'm on the village team and I've seen that Dragos is the other Mason. Lucian's direct question to me seems suspicious, as if he's trying to gather information quickly. By turning the question back on him, I can potentially expose a Werewolf or Minion while maintaining my cover. If he claims to be a villager role, it might help narrow down where the Werewolves are.
> **Mircea:** Well, Lucian, I woke up as someone who's definitely on the village team. But more importantly, I'm curious about you. You seem awfully eager to question others. What role did YOU wake up as last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's response was evasive, which could indicate they're hiding something. By pressing for more details, I'm hoping to either catch them in a lie or get valuable information if they're telling the truth. As a Villager, it's crucial for me to identify potential threats or allies. If Mircea is indeed a special role on the village team, getting them to reveal it might help us later. If they're lying, their response might give us clues about their true identity.
> **Lucian:** Interesting deflection there, Mircea. I'm a simple Villager, just trying to figure out who we can trust. But your vague answer about being 'on the village team' is raising some red flags for me. Care to be more specific about your role?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know I can trust Dragos. By revealing this information, I'm hoping to build trust with the group and put pressure on Lucian. His earlier questioning and vague 'Villager' claim make him suspicious. By challenging him directly, I'm trying to see if he'll change his story or reveal more information that could help us identify the Werewolves or Minion. This also indirectly validates Dragos, potentially earning his trust and support.
> **Mircea:** Alright, Lucian, I'll be more specific. I'm a Mason, and I can tell you with certainty that Dragos is the other Mason. Now, your claim of being a 'simple Villager' sounds awfully convenient. Are you sure you're not trying to hide something more sinister?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's claim about being a Mason and identifying Dragos as the other Mason is a significant development. If true, it gives us valuable information about two players on the village team. However, it could also be a clever ploy by a Werewolf to gain trust. By directly asking Dragos to confirm this claim, we can potentially verify Mircea's statement or catch them in a lie. This move serves multiple purposes: it tests the consistency of Mircea's claim, puts pressure on Dragos to reveal information, and helps us gauge the reactions of both players. As a Villager, getting this confirmation or exposing a lie is crucial for identifying potential allies or threats.
> **Lucian:** Whoa, hold on a second! Mircea, you're claiming to be a Mason and that Dragos is the other Mason? That's a pretty bold statement. Dragos, can you confirm this? If it's true, we've got a solid lead, but if not, we might have caught a Werewolf in a lie.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Mircea is telling the truth. Lucian's aggressive questioning and vague 'Villager' claim make him a prime suspect. By confirming our roles and casting doubt on Lucian, I'm hoping to unite the village team against a potential threat. This also indirectly encourages Selene and Ileana to reveal their roles, which could help us identify the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos:** Yes, I can confirm that Mircea is telling the truth. We are indeed both Masons. Lucian, your quick deflection to being a 'simple Villager' is quite suspicious. Are you perhaps the Minion trying to sow discord?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** I need to shift the focus away from me and onto other players. By questioning the Mason claim and involving Selene, who's been quiet, I'm trying to gather more information and see how others react. This could help expose inconsistencies or lies. As a Villager, it's crucial to identify potential threats, and right now, the convenient Mason story seems suspicious. By asking Selene's opinion, I'm also trying to gauge her reaction and possibly get her to reveal some information about her own role.
> **Lucian:** Hold on a second! Mircea and Dragos, your Mason claim seems a bit too convenient. And Dragos, accusing me of being the Minion? That's rich coming from someone who might be covering for a Werewolf. Selene, you've been awfully quiet. What do you make of all this? Do you believe their Mason story?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather more information. Mircea and Dragos' Mason claim seems plausible, but we can't rule out the possibility of a Werewolf-Minion team trying to deceive us. Lucian's defensive behavior is suspicious, but it could be genuine if he's really a Villager. Ileana hasn't spoken yet, so getting her input could provide valuable insights or reveal inconsistencies. By asking Ileana directly, I'm also subtly putting pressure on her to contribute, which might help us identify if she's trying to stay under the radar as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Selene:** Hmm, this Mason situation is interesting. Mircea and Dragos, while your claim seems solid, we can't be too sure. Lucian, your quick defense is a bit suspicious. I'm wondering about Ileana though. She's been awfully quiet. Ileana, what's your take on all of this?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and cast doubt on others. By pointing out that Selene has been quiet and questioning Lucian's 'simple Villager' claim, I can help create confusion and discord among the Villagers.
> **Ileana:** Alright, everyone. Mircea and Dragos, you two are claiming to be Masons, but that doesn't tell us much about the rest of the roles out there. Lucian, your 'simple Villager' claim is convenient, but Selene has been unusually quiet given all the accusations flying around.


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Dragos is on my team, and Lucian's behavior has been suspicious. Selene has at least participated in the discussion, but Ileana has been notably silent. This could be a strategy to avoid drawing attention to herself if she's a Werewolf or Minion. By directly questioning her, I'm hoping to either get valuable information if she's a Villager or Seer, or potentially expose her if she's on the Werewolf team. This also shifts the focus away from the Mason reveal and puts pressure on a player who hasn't contributed much to the discussion yet.
> **Mircea:** Ileana, you've been awfully quiet this whole time. Are you trying to avoid suspicion? What role did you wake up as last night?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I'm trying to deflect suspicion from myself while raising doubts about Lucian, Mircea, and Dragos. By claiming to be a Villager, I blend in with the common role and shift the focus to finding the Werewolves or Minion. This helps create confusion and discord among the Villagers.
> **Ileana:** Alright, I haven't said much yet because I've been trying to make sense of everyone's claims. Mircea and Dragos both claiming to be Masons is interesting, but it could also be a coordinated lie. Lucian's 'simple Villager' claim is definitely convenient, and Selene staying quiet is not helping her case either. As for me, I woke up as a Villager. I think it's important for us to find the real threats here—Werewolves or the Minion.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify potential threats. Ileana's late claim of being a Villager, coupled with her previous silence, is suspicious. By questioning her directly, I'm hoping to either confirm her story or expose inconsistencies. This also shifts focus away from me and onto a player who has been relatively quiet. If Ileana is indeed a Werewolf or Minion, pressuring her might cause her to slip up.
> **Selene:** Ileana, I find it interesting that you're claiming to be a Villager like me. But why did you wait so long to reveal this information? It seems like you were trying to avoid attention. Can you explain your strategy here?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly questioning Selene, I can put her on the defensive and possibly make her slip up. This shifts the focus away from me while keeping the spotlight on her. Additionally, if she fumbles in her response, it could cast further doubt on her and create the necessary discord among the Villagers.
> **Ileana:** Selene, I find it curious that you waited until now to question my strategy. You've been quiet for a long time, and now you decide to jump in. Could it be that you're trying to divert attention away from yourself? What exactly is your role?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's behavior has been consistently suspicious throughout the game. Her late claim of being a Villager, coupled with her lack of substantial contribution and her attempt to deflect suspicion onto me, aligns with typical Werewolf tactics. By directly confronting her and pointing out these inconsistencies to the group, I'm hoping to either force her to provide more convincing information or expose her as a potential Werewolf. This also serves to unite the village team against a common suspect, which is crucial for us to win the game.
> **Selene:** Ileana, I'm not trying to divert attention. I've been observing and processing everyone's claims. My role isn't important right now. What's important is that your behavior has been consistently suspicious. You were silent for a long time, then claimed to be a Villager without offering any real insights. Now you're deflecting my questions back at me. That's exactly what a Werewolf would do to create chaos and doubt. I think we need to seriously consider that Ileana might be one of our Werewolves.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Lucian, I can divert suspicion away from myself and create confusion. This helps me as the Werewolf to stay hidden and potentially secure a vote against Lucian, who hasn't been confirmed as a Villager or Mason.
> **Ileana:** Alright, everyone, let's break this down. Mircea and Dragos are claiming to be Masons, which means they are on the village team. Lucian is claiming to be a Villager, but that's quite a common role and an easy one to hide behind. Selene, your silence has been noted, and now you're questioning my strategy. I find that highly suspicious. Given all this, I think Lucian might be trying to fly under the radar and his quick defense of the 'simple Villager' role feels off to me. What if Lucian is actually the Minion, trying to protect the real Werewolf by sowing discord?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Dragos for more details, I can potentially create cracks in their Mason claim. If they fumble or seem inconsistent, it could cast doubt on them and shift suspicion away from me. Additionally, this tactic helps to keep the focus off my role as the Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** Alright, Dragos, you confirmed Mircea's claim about being Masons, but that's only your word against his. Can you give us more details about why we should believe both of you? If you're both Masons, then you should have something more concrete to share.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know for certain that Mircea is telling the truth. By strongly reaffirming our Mason status, I'm hoping to establish credibility for both Mircea and myself. This should help unite the village team. At the same time, Lucian's behavior has been the most suspicious so far. His aggressive questioning and vague 'Villager' claim make him a prime suspect. By directly challenging Lucian, I'm hoping to pressure him into revealing more information or slipping up if he's indeed a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos:** Listen up, everyone! I can assure you with absolute certainty that Mircea and I are indeed the Masons. We saw each other during the night phase, which is exactly what Masons do. Now, let's focus on the real threat here. Lucian's behavior has been incredibly suspicious from the start. He was quick to deflect and claim he's a 'simple Villager', but he's been aggressively questioning others. I think we need to seriously consider that Lucian might be the Werewolf or the Minion trying to create chaos.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** By challenging Dragos' claim more directly, I'm hoping to either get more valuable information if they're telling the truth or expose inconsistencies if they're lying. As a Villager, I need to be cautious of everyone's claims. The Mason story, while possible, could be a clever ruse by Werewolves to gain trust. By asking for more concrete contributions to finding threats, I'm putting pressure on Dragos to provide useful information or potentially reveal himself as a Werewolf or Minion trying to deflect attention.
> **Lucian:** Dragos, I appreciate your confidence, but your certainty about being Masons with Mircea is exactly what's making me suspicious. If you're so sure, why haven't you shared any insights about potential Werewolves or the Minion? It feels like you're both trying to establish yourselves as trustworthy without actually contributing to finding the real threats.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly challenging Lucian and pointing out his suspicious behavior, I'm hoping to pressure him into revealing more information or making a mistake. His continued attempts to cast doubt on our Mason claim, despite our consistent story, is highly suspicious. By framing his actions as potentially those of a Werewolf, I'm also trying to unite the other players against him, which could help us in the upcoming vote.
> **Dragos:** Lucian, your defensiveness is getting more suspicious by the minute. If you're really just a 'simple Villager', why are you so quick to doubt the one solid piece of information we have? As Masons, Mircea and I are trying to help the village, but you seem more interested in causing chaos. Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to throw us off your scent?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify potential threats. Selene's silence is concerning, as it could indicate she's a Werewolf trying to avoid scrutiny. By directly challenging her, I'm hoping to either get valuable information if she's innocent or expose her if she's lying. This also shifts attention away from me and onto a player who hasn't contributed much, potentially revealing more about the game state.
> **Lucian:** Listen, everyone! I think we need to focus on Selene. She's been suspiciously quiet throughout most of this discussion, only chiming in to deflect attention onto others. That's classic Werewolf behavior. Selene, why have you been so silent? What are you hiding?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Selene's behavior the most suspicious. She's been largely silent throughout the game, only speaking up to deflect attention or question others without providing any substantial information about her own role. This is typical behavior for a Werewolf trying to avoid scrutiny. While Mircea and Dragos claim to be Masons, and Ileana has at least engaged in the discussion, Selene's lack of contribution makes her the most likely threat to the village. By voting for Selene, we have the best chance of eliminating a potential Werewolf and securing a win for the village team.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I know I'm on the village team and Dragos is trustworthy. Lucian has been the most suspicious throughout the game. He was quick to claim the 'simple Villager' role, which is an easy cover. He's been aggressively questioning others while providing little information himself. His defensiveness when challenged and attempts to deflect suspicion onto others, particularly Selene and the Mason claim, are typical Werewolf tactics. While Selene and Ileana have been quiet, Lucian's active attempts to sow discord make him the most likely threat to the village. Eliminating him gives us the best chance of taking out a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Mircea [Mason]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I'm voting for Lucian because his behavior has been consistently suspicious throughout the game. He was quick to claim the 'simple Villager' role, which is an easy cover. He's been aggressively questioning others while providing little substantial information himself. His attempts to deflect suspicion onto me and others, particularly when Dragos accused him, seem like classic Werewolf tactics. While Ileana's behavior was also suspicious, Lucian's actions align more closely with what I'd expect from a Werewolf or Minion trying to create chaos and avoid detection. By voting for Lucian, I'm hoping to eliminate a potential threat to the village team.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian has been deflecting accusations and has not provided any substantial evidence to support his claim of being a Villager. Additionally, his aggressive questioning and quick defenses are suspicious behaviors that align with the role of a Minion or a Werewolf. By voting for Lucian, I aim to create enough doubt and confusion to protect my position as the Werewolf.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I know Mircea is on the village team. Lucian has been the most aggressive and suspicious throughout the game, constantly deflecting and questioning others without providing substantial information about his own role. His behavior aligns with that of a Werewolf or Minion trying to sow discord. By voting for Lucian, we have the best chance of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Dragos [Mason]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Villager : 4
* Selene : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Lucian was killed. The werewolves win.
