## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Lucian. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Ileana. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Emil. They are thinking about their action.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards provides more information overall. There's a good chance of finding a Werewolf or another powerful role, which could help narrow down the possibilities for the other players' roles. If I find a Werewolf in the center, I'll know there's only one Werewolf among the players. Additionally, this information can be used to corroborate or disprove other players' claims later in the game, giving me a strategic advantage without directly revealing anyone's role.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, it's crucial to share this information early in the game. Revealing that there's a Minion in the center eliminates the possibility of a Minion among the players, which narrows down our search for the Werewolf. Additionally, knowing there's only one Werewolf increases the pressure on them and might make them more likely to slip up. This information also helps the village team to focus their efforts on finding the single Werewolf rather than worrying about multiple threats.
> **Emil:** Hey everyone, I've got some interesting information to share. I looked at two center cards during the night, and I found a Minion and a Villager there. This means there's definitely one Werewolf among us, and they're working alone. We need to be extra careful and observant.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's claim to be the Seer is suspicious. If he's telling the truth, it's valuable information, but it could also be a ploy by the Werewolf or Minion to mislead us. By questioning him directly, I hope to gauge his reaction and see if he can provide more convincing details. As a Villager, it's crucial for me to identify potential threats, and Emil's statement, if false, could be dangerous.
> **Dracula:** Emil, that's quite a bold claim. How can we be sure you're really the Seer? It seems convenient that you're saying there's only one Werewolf. Could you be trying to protect someone?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's immediate challenge to my claim is suspicious. As the Seer, I need to defend my position and the information I've shared. By turning the question back on Dracula and suggesting he might be the Werewolf, I'm putting pressure on him to explain his skepticism. This could potentially reveal more information about his role or motivations. Additionally, by confidently reaffirming my role as the Seer, I'm making it harder for the real Werewolf to claim this role later in the game.
> **Emil:** Dracula, I understand your skepticism, but I assure you I am the Seer. Why are you so quick to question my claim? It seems like you might be trying to cast doubt on valuable information. Are you perhaps the lone Werewolf trying to create confusion?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm maintaining my role as a villager by seeking more information. By asking Emil for more specific details about his Seer action, I'm giving him a chance to either solidify his claim or potentially expose inconsistencies. This could help us determine if he's really the Seer or if he might be the Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive us. It's crucial to gather as much information as possible to identify the true threats to the village.
> **Dracula:** Emil, I'm not trying to create confusion, I'm just being cautious. As a villager, I need to be sure we're not being misled. Can you tell us more about what you saw in those center cards? Any details about their position or anything else unusual?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** By providing more details about the center cards, I'm reinforcing my claim as the Seer. However, I don't want to spend too much time defending myself, as it might make me look suspicious. Instead, I'm shifting the focus to Ileana, who hasn't spoken yet. This serves two purposes: it takes the pressure off me and potentially reveals more information about other players' roles. Ileana's response could give us clues about her allegiance or role.
> **Emil:** Listen, I understand the need for caution, but as the Seer, I can only share what I saw. The Minion card was on the left, and the Villager on the right. That's all I can say about their positions. Now, Ileana, you've been awfully quiet. What's your take on this situation?


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know there's another Mason card in the center. Emil's claim about seeing a Minion card doesn't align with this knowledge. By questioning this discrepancy, I'm trying to expose a potential lie without revealing my role. If Emil is lying about being the Seer, he might be the Werewolf or the Minion trying to create confusion. This question also puts pressure on the real Minion, if there is one, to reveal themselves or stay silent, which could provide more information.
> **Ileana:** Emil, I appreciate your information as the Seer, but I'm curious about something. You said you saw a Minion card in the center, which means there should be a Minion among us. Has anyone claimed to be the Minion yet? It seems odd that they haven't spoken up to support the Werewolf.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana's statement contains a significant error that could mislead other players. By pointing this out, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) Reinforcing my role as the Seer and the accuracy of my information, 2) Putting pressure on Ileana to explain her mistake, which could reveal more about her role or intentions, and 3) Keeping the focus on finding the lone Werewolf rather than getting sidetracked by non-existent roles. If Ileana is the Werewolf, this mistake could be an attempt to create confusion, and calling her out might make her slip up further.
> **Emil:** Ileana, you're mistaken. I said I saw the Minion card in the center, which means there is NO Minion among us. This is crucial information. Are you trying to confuse everyone, or did you genuinely misunderstand? Either way, it's quite suspicious.


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's inconsistency in his statements about the Minion card is a red flag. As a Mason, I know there's a Mason card in the center, which conflicts with his initial claim. By pointing out this contradiction, I'm trying to expose his potential lie without revealing my role. This could lead others to question Emil's credibility and possibly uncover the true Werewolf or Minion. It's crucial to address this discrepancy to progress the game and gather more information from other players' reactions.
> **Ileana:** Emil, I apologize for the confusion, but I didn't misunderstand. You specifically said, and I quote, 'I looked at two center cards during the night, and I found a Minion and a Villager there.' Now you're saying there's NO Minion among us? This contradiction is very suspicious. Are you changing your story, or is there something else going on here?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana's insistence on misinterpreting my clear statement about the Minion card being in the center is highly suspicious. By directly confronting her and reiterating my consistent stance, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) Reinforcing my role as the Seer and the accuracy of my information, 2) Putting more pressure on Ileana to explain her persistent confusion, which could reveal more about her role or intentions, 3) Suggesting to other players that Ileana might be the Werewolf, which could lead to more scrutiny of her actions. If Ileana is indeed the Werewolf, this direct confrontation might cause her to make more mistakes or reveal her true role.
> **Emil:** Ileana, I think you're trying to twist my words. I've been consistent from the start - I saw the Minion card in the center, which means there's NO Minion among us players. Your attempt to create confusion is making you look very suspicious. Are you the Werewolf trying to muddy the waters?


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know there's a Mason card in the center, which contradicts Emil's initial claim about seeing a Minion and a Villager. His changing story about the Minion card is a clear red flag. By directly confronting Emil and pointing out these inconsistencies to the group, I'm trying to expose him as a potential Werewolf or Minion without revealing my own role. This accusation might prompt others to share their thoughts or reveal information they've been holding back, helping us identify the true threat.
> **Ileana:** Emil, your inconsistency is very troubling. First, you claimed to see a Minion and a Villager in the center, now you're saying there's no Minion among us. This doesn't add up. I think you might be the Werewolf trying to confuse us all. What do the rest of you think about this?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Alexia and Lucian directly, I'm attempting to shift the focus of suspicion onto Ileana while also engaging the other players who have been quiet so far. This serves multiple purposes: 1) It reinforces my consistent stance as the Seer, 2) It puts more pressure on Ileana to explain her behavior, 3) It encourages Alexia and Lucian to share their thoughts, potentially revealing more information about their roles or suspicions. If Ileana is indeed the Werewolf, this collective scrutiny might force her to make more mistakes or reveal her true role. Additionally, by involving the other players, I'm fostering a sense of unity among the village team against a potential threat.
> **Emil:** I can't believe you're still trying to twist my words, Ileana. Let me be crystal clear: I saw the Minion card IN THE CENTER, which means there is NO Minion among us players. Your persistent attempts to create confusion are extremely suspicious. Alexia and Lucian, what do you think about Ileana's behavior? Doesn't it seem like she's desperately trying to discredit me and confuse everyone?


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly involving Alexia and Lucian, I'm attempting to gather more information and potentially expose Emil's lies. As a Mason, I know there's a Mason card in the center, which contradicts Emil's claims about the center cards. By asking Alexia and Lucian about their roles and observations, I'm hoping to either confirm Emil's deception or gain new information that could help identify the Werewolf. This approach also shifts the focus from Emil's accusation against me and puts pressure on the other players to contribute to the discussion.
> **Ileana:** Alexia and Lucian, we need your input here. Emil's story keeps changing, and he's trying to deflect suspicion onto me. What roles do you have? Have you noticed anything suspicious during the night phase?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to get to the bottom of this confusion. Emil's claims about being the Seer are crucial, but there seems to be some inconsistency in his statements. By asking him to clarify one more time, I'm giving him a chance to explain himself clearly. If he continues to be inconsistent, it might indicate that he's lying and could potentially be the Werewolf. On the other hand, if he clarifies convincingly, it could help us identify Ileana as the possible Werewolf trying to create confusion. This question is aimed at resolving the conflict and helping us villagers identify the true threat.
> **Alexia:** Emil, I've been listening carefully to your claims and Ileana's responses. Can you clarify one more time what exactly you saw in the center cards? Your story seems to have some inconsistencies that are making me uneasy.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** By reiterating my statement clearly and directly to Alexia, I'm addressing her concerns while also maintaining my consistent narrative. This serves to reinforce my credibility as the Seer and highlight Ileana's suspicious behavior. By asking Alexia for her opinion on Ileana, I'm encouraging her to take a stance and potentially reveal more information about her own role or observations. This could help unite the village team against the most likely Werewolf candidate, Ileana.
> **Emil:** Alexia, I appreciate your request for clarification. I'll say it one more time, slowly and clearly: I, as the Seer, looked at two center cards during the night. Those cards were a Minion and a Villager. This means there is NO Minion among us players, and there is only ONE Werewolf in play. Ileana's persistent attempts to twist this simple information are extremely suspicious. What's your take on her behavior?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to remain neutral and gather more information. Emil's inconsistencies are troubling, but Ileana's aggressive questioning could be a Werewolf tactic to create chaos. By asking for input from the quieter players, Lucian and Dracula, I'm hoping to get fresh perspectives and potentially uncover new information that could help us identify the Werewolf. This approach also avoids directly accusing anyone while still addressing the suspicions raised so far.
> **Alexia:** Emil, I appreciate your clarification, but I'm still not entirely convinced. Your story has changed slightly each time you've explained it, which is concerning. Ileana, while your suspicion is valid, your aggressive approach isn't helping us uncover the truth. I think we need to hear from Lucian and Dracula now. What are your thoughts on this situation?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil has repeatedly changed his story and has been very defensive, which is a common tactic for someone trying to cover up their true role. By casting suspicion on Emil, I can divert attention away from myself and possibly from any allies, making it harder for the Villagers to identify the real Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** Alexia, I think you raised some very valid points about Emil's inconsistencies. Emil, you've been very defensive and your story seems to change slightly each time you explain it. This makes me very suspicious of you. Are you trying to hide something from us?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's sudden accusation aligns suspiciously with Ileana's attempts to discredit me. By directly challenging Lucian and suggesting a potential alliance with Ileana, I'm aiming to put him on the defensive and possibly reveal more about his role. This also serves to reinforce my consistent stance as the Seer and redirect suspicion away from me and back onto the players who are creating confusion. If Lucian is indeed the Werewolf, this direct confrontation might cause him to make a mistake or reveal his true intentions.
> **Emil:** Lucian, I've been nothing but consistent from the start. I saw a Minion and a Villager in the center, period. It's Ileana who's been twisting my words and creating confusion. And now you're jumping on that bandwagon? That's awfully convenient. Are you perhaps working with Ileana as the Werewolf?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By highlighting Emil's inconsistencies and defensiveness, I can cast doubt on his credibility and draw attention away from myself. This will make it harder for the Villagers to identify the real Werewolf, and potentially get them to suspect Emil as the Werewolf instead.
> **Lucian:** I think Emil's story is quite shaky, and it's making me suspicious. You've repeatedly stated that you saw a Minion and a Villager in the center cards, but the inconsistencies in your explanation suggest that you might be trying to mislead us.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly challenging Lucian and linking his behavior to Ileana's, I'm attempting to expose a potential Werewolf alliance. This serves multiple purposes: 1) It reinforces my consistent stance as the Seer, 2) It puts pressure on Lucian to explain his sudden accusation, 3) It suggests to other players that Lucian and Ileana might be working together, which could lead to more scrutiny of their actions. If either of them is the Werewolf, this direct confrontation might cause them to make more mistakes or reveal their true role. Additionally, by questioning Lucian's motives, I'm encouraging other players to reconsider the validity of his accusations against me.
> **Emil:** Lucian, your sudden alignment with Ileana's accusations is very suspicious. Why are you so eager to discredit me when I've been consistent about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center? It seems like you two might be working together to confuse everyone. Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to throw us off your scent?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Emil's inconsistencies and accusing him directly, I can draw attention away from myself and cast doubt on his credibility. This aligns with my goal of hiding my identity as the Werewolf and potentially getting the Villagers to suspect and vote for Emil instead.
> **Lucian:** Alexia, I think it's crucial we address Emil's inconsistencies. Emil, you've claimed multiple times that you saw a Minion and a Villager in the center. However, your story keeps shifting slightly each time you explain it, which is incredibly suspicious. If you were truly consistent and honest, there wouldn't be these discrepancies. I'm starting to believe that you're trying to cover up your true role and create confusion among us.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I've consistently maintained that I saw a Minion and a Villager in the center cards. Ileana has been the most persistent in twisting my words and creating confusion. Her initial misinterpretation of my statement and continued attempts to discredit me are highly suspicious. While Lucian has also raised doubts, Ileana's behavior from the start has been more consistently aligned with what I'd expect from a Werewolf trying to create chaos and doubt. By voting for Ileana, I'm hoping to eliminate the most likely Werewolf threat and protect the village team.
> **Emil [Seer]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Emil's inconsistent story about being the Seer highly suspicious. His claims about seeing a Minion and Villager in the center have been inconsistent throughout the discussion, and he's become increasingly defensive when questioned. This behavior suggests he might be the Werewolf trying to mislead the group. By voting for Emil, I hope to eliminate the most likely threat to the village and secure a win for the village team.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know there's a Mason card in the center, which contradicts Emil's claim about seeing a Minion and a Villager there. His inconsistent story and defensive behavior strongly suggest he's lying about being the Seer. He's likely the Werewolf or Minion trying to create confusion. Voting for Emil is the best chance to eliminate the threat to the village team.
> **Ileana [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Emil's inconsistencies in his Seer claim to be the most suspicious. His story about the center cards has slightly changed throughout the discussion, and his defensive behavior when questioned raises red flags. While Ileana and Lucian have been aggressive in their questioning, their suspicions seem more justified given Emil's shifting narrative. Emil's attempts to deflect suspicion onto others when cornered also seem like a classic Werewolf tactic. Given the information available, voting for Emil seems like the best chance to eliminate the Werewolf and secure a victory for the village team.
> **Alexia [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil's story has been inconsistent and defensive throughout the discussion. His constant changes and accusations make him appear suspicious and potentially the Werewolf trying to mislead us. By voting for Emil, I aim to divert attention away from myself and increase the chances of the Villagers suspecting him instead.
> **Lucian [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Emil : Seer : 4
* Ileana : Mason : 1



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The werewolves win.
