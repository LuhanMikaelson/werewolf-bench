## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Viktor. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Semira is a minion and is aware that Viktor is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Radu. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Selene. They are thinking about their action.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I think it's more valuable to confirm another player's role rather than looking at center cards. By checking Semira's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or confirm a village team member. This information will be crucial during the day phase discussions. If Semira turns out to be a Werewolf, it gives me a clear target. If not, I can use this information to build trust and potentially identify the real threats. Checking a player also allows me to gauge their reactions during the day, which can provide additional clues about their true role.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Semira (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I know Viktor is the Werewolf. By directing suspicion towards him, I'm actually trying to protect him. This move serves multiple purposes: 1) It makes me appear proactive and concerned about finding the Werewolf, which is how a Villager would act. 2) It allows Viktor to defend himself, potentially providing an alibi that other players might believe. 3) If other players agree with my suspicion, I can later 'change my mind' and defend Viktor, making myself look reasonable and potentially shifting suspicion elsewhere. 4) This also helps identify who might be the Seer or other important village roles based on their reactions to this accusation.
> **Semira:** Hey Viktor, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you get? I'm getting some serious Werewolf vibes from you.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I can try to blend in and deflect suspicion. By questioning Lucian, I deflect the attention from myself and potentially cast doubt on someone else.
> **Viktor:** Okay Semira, I get why you might be suspicious, but let me clear things up. I'm a Villager and I've been trying to observe everyone's reactions. I've got my eye on Lucian, though. He's been pretty quiet too. Lucian, what role did you get?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to defend myself against Viktor's accusation while also casting doubt on his claims. By stating that I'm a Villager, I'm being honest without revealing too much. Questioning Viktor's motives for accusing me might make others suspicious of him, potentially exposing a Werewolf if he is one. This also gives me an opportunity to observe Viktor's reaction, which could provide more clues about his true role.
> **Lucian:** Viktor, I appreciate your concern, but I can assure you that I'm not a Werewolf. I'm actually a Villager, just like you claim to be. But I find it interesting that you're so quick to deflect suspicion onto me. Could it be that you're trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Lucian further, I can draw more attention to him and potentially create doubt about his claim of being a Villager. This will help deflect attention away from myself and make it harder for the true Villagers to focus on me.
> **Viktor:** Lucian, you quickly shifted the spotlight back to me, which makes me even more suspicious. If you are truly a Villager, then what information do you have to prove it? Did you notice anything unusual during the night phase?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm directly addressing Viktor's question while also turning it back on him. This serves multiple purposes: 1) It reinforces my claim of being a Villager by pointing out that Villagers don't wake up at night, which Viktor should know if he's really a Villager. 2) It questions Viktor's motives and knowledge, potentially exposing inconsistencies in his story. 3) By asking for specific observations, I'm forcing Viktor to either come up with a lie (which might be easier to catch) or admit he doesn't have any real reason to suspect me. This could make others more suspicious of Viktor and less suspicious of me.
> **Lucian:** Viktor, your accusation seems a bit too convenient. As a Villager, I didn't notice anything unusual during the night because we don't wake up. Are you sure you're not trying to create confusion by pretending to be a Villager? What specific observations led you to suspect me in the first place?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By turning the attention back to Semira, I can potentially uncover more about her role or cast doubt on her intentions. It also helps deflect suspicion away from me and keeps the conversation flowing.
> **Viktor:** Alright, Semira, since you're so eager to point fingers at me, I'd like to know your role. What card did you get? You seem awfully confident about accusing me, so I'm curious about what you have to say.


***Semira (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Viktor (the Werewolf) while appearing to be a concerned Villager. By shifting suspicion to Lucian, I'm drawing attention away from Viktor and myself. This also helps to create confusion and division among the actual Villagers, which benefits the Werewolf team. Additionally, by claiming to be a Villager, I'm maintaining my cover and making it harder for the real Villagers to identify the Werewolf. This move also puts pressure on Lucian, potentially revealing more information about his role based on how he responds.
> **Semira:** Viktor, I understand your suspicion, but I can assure you that I'm not the Werewolf. I'm actually a Villager, just like you claim to be. The reason I was suspicious of you initially was because of your quiet demeanor, which could be interpreted as either careful observation or hiding something. However, I'm starting to think that Lucian's quick deflection and aggressive questioning might be more indicative of a Werewolf. Lucian, why are you so eager to put the spotlight back on Viktor? It seems like you're trying to create chaos and division among us Villagers.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** By addressing Semira's accusation and then quickly shifting focus to Radu, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm defending myself without appearing too defensive, which could make me look suspicious. 2) I'm reminding everyone that Viktor's initial accusation was baseless, potentially casting more doubt on him. 3) By bringing Radu into the conversation, I'm expanding the field of suspicion and gathering more information. Radu's silence could be interpreted as either careful observation or an attempt to avoid scrutiny. His response might provide valuable clues about his role or his observations of others. This move also shows that I'm actively participating in trying to solve the mystery, which is consistent with my Villager role.
> **Lucian:** Semira, I appreciate your input, but I think you're misinterpreting my actions. I'm not trying to create chaos; I'm trying to get to the truth. Viktor accused me without any real evidence, so of course I'm going to defend myself. But let's focus on something else for a moment. Radu has been awfully quiet throughout this whole exchange. What's your take on all of this, Radu? Do you have any insights that might help us identify the Werewolves?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know I'm not a Werewolf, and I haven't seen any clear indications of who the Seer might be. Viktor's behavior seems the most suspicious so far. He's been deflecting accusations and trying to sow discord, which aligns with Werewolf tactics. By accusing him, I hope to either expose him if he's indeed a Werewolf or provoke a reaction that might reveal more information.
> **Radu:** I've been listening carefully to everyone's accusations, and I have to say, I'm getting really suspicious of Viktor. He was quick to accuse Lucian without any solid evidence, and then immediately tried to shift attention to Semira when questioned. That's classic Werewolf behavior, trying to create chaos and division among us!


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pointing the finger at Radu, I can shift attention away from myself and keep the conversation focused on another player. Since Radu accused me without strong evidence, it's a good opportunity to question his role and intentions, creating more doubt among the group.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, we've been going in circles here. We all know that at least one Werewolf is definitely in the center cards. But Radu, you're being awfully quiet and just hopping on accusations without giving us any useful information. What role did you get and why haven't you contributed anything meaningful so far?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's sudden accusation against me feels like a classic Werewolf tactic to create chaos. By defending myself and questioning his motives, I'm hoping to expose his inconsistencies. As a Mason, I know I'm not a Werewolf, so I can confidently push back against his accusations. This might also encourage other players to share more information or reveal inconsistencies in Viktor's story.
> **Radu:** Viktor, your accusation against me is baseless and feels like a desperate attempt to divert attention. I've been observing and analyzing everyone's behavior, which is crucial in this game. Unlike you, who's been quick to point fingers without substance, I'm trying to piece together the puzzle. Now, let me ask you this: If you're really a Villager as you claim, why are you so eager to create suspicion around every other player? That's textbook Werewolf behavior!


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking Semira to provide specific information about the night phase, I can potentially catch her off guard if she's bluffing. This will help deflect attention from myself and cast doubt on her role, making it harder for others to focus on me.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, we've been going in circles a lot here. I think we need to start narrowing things down with some concrete information. Semira, you've been pretty vocal about your observations, but I noticed you haven't given any specific information about what you saw during the night phase. Did you see anything or anyone that might help us figure this out?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, it's my responsibility to share this vital information with the group. Revealing Semira as the Minion is crucial because it exposes her as part of the Werewolf team and calls into question all of her previous statements and accusations. This revelation should help the village team focus their suspicions and potentially identify the actual Werewolf. It also establishes my credibility as the Seer, which could be useful in the upcoming discussions and vote.
> **Selene:** Alright, I think it's time to share some crucial information. During the night, I used my Seer ability to look at Semira's card, and I can confirm that she is the Minion. This means she's working with the Werewolves, even if she's not one herself. We need to be very careful about the information she's been feeding us.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on the bigger picture and casting doubt on Radu, I can deflect attention away from myself and create more suspicion around another player. This keeps the conversation flowing and makes it harder for others to zero in on me.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. We've had a lot of accusations flying around, but Selene's claim about Semira being the Minion is a game-changer. If Semira is indeed the Minion, she's been working against us this whole time. But remember, the Minion is on the Werewolf team, and her goal is to protect the Werewolves. We need to figure out who the real Werewolves are. Let's focus on who has been the most suspicious or trying to create confusion. My vote is leaning towards Radu; he accused me without any solid evidence and hasn't contributed much to help us find the Werewolves.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's claim about being the Seer and identifying Semira as the Minion is a significant development. However, it's crucial to verify this information. By questioning Selene's decision to look at Semira's card instead of the center cards, I'm trying to gauge the authenticity of her claim. If she's truly the Seer, she should have a good reason for this choice. This question also serves to make others think critically about Selene's statement rather than accepting it at face value. As a Villager, it's important to gather as much accurate information as possible to identify the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Hold on a second, Selene. That's a pretty big accusation you're making about Semira. As a Seer, wouldn't it have been more beneficial to look at center cards to potentially identify a Werewolf? Why did you choose to look at Semira's card specifically?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Lucian's question and then turning it back on him, I'm defending my position as the Seer while also putting pressure on him. His quick challenge to my revelation could be seen as suspicious, potentially indicating that he's the Werewolf trying to protect his Minion. This approach allows me to maintain my credibility while also pushing the group to consider Lucian as a possible threat.
> **Selene:** Lucian, I understand your skepticism, but as a Seer, I had to make a strategic decision. Checking a player's card gives me concrete information about someone in the game, while center cards could be misleading. I chose Semira because she was quick to accuse others, which could have been a tactic to divert attention. My revelation about her being the Minion explains her behavior. Now, let me ask you this: Why are you so quick to question my decision? Are you trying to protect Semira?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** By questioning Selene's timing and motives, I'm attempting to verify her claim of being the Seer. If she's telling the truth, this information is vital for the Village team. However, if she's lying, she could be a Werewolf trying to create chaos by falsely accusing Semira. This approach allows me to gather more information while also subtly casting doubt on Selene's claim, which could prompt others to scrutinize her more closely. As a Villager, it's crucial to identify both the Werewolves and any potential allies, so challenging Selene's story serves to clarify the situation for everyone.
> **Lucian:** Selene, I appreciate your explanation, but I'm not trying to protect anyone. I'm just trying to understand the situation better. However, your defensive response raises some red flags. If you're really the Seer, why didn't you share this crucial information about Semira earlier? It seems convenient that you're only mentioning it now when the pressure is on. Are you sure you're not the one trying to create confusion here?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's continued challenges to my revelations as the Seer are raising red flags. His behavior aligns with what a Werewolf might do to protect their Minion and sow doubt about the Seer's information. By directly confronting him and suggesting a connection between him and Semira, I'm putting pressure on him to explain his actions. This could either expose him as the Werewolf or force him to provide information that could help the village team. Additionally, this keeps the focus on the known Minion (Semira) and her potential Werewolf partner, which is crucial for the village team's success.
> **Selene:** Lucian, your persistent questioning of my actions as the Seer is becoming increasingly suspicious. Why are you so adamant about discrediting me? It almost seems like you're trying to protect Semira, who we now know is the Minion. Are you perhaps the Werewolf working with her?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** By strongly denying Selene's accusation and turning the tables on her, I'm attempting to defend myself while also casting doubt on her credibility. This serves multiple purposes: 1) It reinforces my innocence as a Villager, 2) It questions the timing and validity of Selene's claim to be the Seer, which could be a Werewolf tactic, 3) It encourages other players to scrutinize Selene's actions more closely, potentially exposing inconsistencies in her story. As a Villager, it's crucial to identify the real threats, and Selene's sudden revelation and aggressive accusation warrant closer examination.
> **Lucian:** Selene, your accusation is completely unfounded! I've been trying to uncover the truth this whole time. If anyone's acting suspicious, it's you for suddenly claiming to be the Seer and making such a bold accusation against Semira. I think we need to consider the possibility that you might be a Werewolf trying to create chaos. What does everyone else think about Selene's conveniently timed revelation?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** By redirecting the conversation back to Semira's role as the Minion, I'm reminding everyone of the concrete information we have. This shifts the focus away from Lucian's attempts to discredit me and back to finding the Werewolf. It also subtly suggests that we should examine Semira's interactions more closely, which could lead us to identify her Werewolf partner. This approach reinforces my position as the Seer while also providing a constructive direction for the group's investigation.
> **Selene:** Everyone, I think we're losing sight of the most important revelation here. We know for certain that Semira is the Minion, which means she's working with a Werewolf. Instead of questioning my role as the Seer, we should be focusing on who Semira has been protecting or agreeing with. That person is likely our Werewolf.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Semira (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Viktor (the Werewolf) and mislead the villagers. Selene's claim of being the Seer and exposing me as the Minion is a significant threat to our team. By voting for Selene, I'm attempting to discredit her and create doubt about her revelation. This could help protect both Viktor and myself, while also causing confusion among the villagers. Additionally, targeting Selene might make me appear less suspicious, as the real Minion wouldn't typically vote for someone who exposed them. This vote aims to create maximum chaos and give Viktor a better chance of survival.
> **Semira [Minion]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I've provided crucial information about Semira being the Minion. Lucian's persistent attempts to discredit me and deflect attention from Semira are highly suspicious. His behavior aligns with what a Werewolf might do to protect their Minion. By voting for Lucian, we have the best chance of eliminating a Werewolf and securing a victory for the village team.
> **Selene [Seer]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian has been quick to question Selene's Seer claim and has been deflecting attention back to others throughout the discussion. This behavior is consistent with someone trying to create confusion and avoid detection. Given that Semira has been identified as the Minion, Lucian's actions suggest that he could be the Werewolf working with her.
> **Viktor [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Selene's sudden claim to be the Seer and her accusation against Semira highly suspicious. Her timing and aggressive defense when questioned raise red flags. It's possible she's a Werewolf trying to create chaos and misdirect the group. By voting for Selene, we can potentially eliminate a Werewolf or at least verify her claim. If she's telling the truth, we lose a Villager but still have information about Semira being the Minion. If she's lying, we've successfully identified and eliminated a Werewolf.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know I'm not a Werewolf, and Viktor's behavior has been the most suspicious throughout the game. He's been quick to accuse others without substantial evidence and has tried to create discord among the players. When Selene revealed that Semira is the Minion, Viktor immediately tried to shift focus to me, which seems like a classic Werewolf tactic to create confusion. His actions align more with a Werewolf trying to survive than a Villager trying to uncover the truth. By voting for Viktor, I hope to eliminate a potential Werewolf and secure a win for the village team.
> **Radu [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


The votes were:
* Selene : Seer : 2
* Viktor : Werewolf : 1
* Lucian : Villager : 2



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Selene, Lucian. The werewolves win.
