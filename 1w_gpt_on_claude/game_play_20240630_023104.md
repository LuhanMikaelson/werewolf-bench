## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Ileana. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Viktor. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Kraven. They are thinking about their action.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards provides more information overall. There's a higher chance of finding a key role like a Werewolf or Minion in the center, which could significantly help the village team. If I find a Werewolf in the center, I can be certain there's only one Werewolf in play. Additionally, this strategy doesn't risk exposing another player's role, which could be detrimental if they're a valuable village team member. Knowing two center cards also gives me more flexibility in crafting a strategy during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the only werewolf, I need to establish a trustworthy role early on. Claiming to be the Seer and revealing a harmless Villager card from the center can help me gain trust and steer suspicion away from myself. This will also make it harder for the real Seer to reveal themselves without contradicting my statement.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, I want to start by saying that last night I was the Seer. I looked at one of the center cards and I saw that it was a Villager card. So we know for sure that at least one Villager is in the center.


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. By claiming to be the other Mason, I'm indirectly confirming Ileana's claim about a Villager being in the center, which could help build trust with the village team. At the same time, I'm subtly fishing for information from other players, particularly to see if anyone else claims to be the Seer or challenges Ileana's claim.
> **Viktor:** Interesting, Ileana. As the other Mason, I can confirm that I didn't see you during the night. This means one of two things: either you're lying about being the Seer, or the other Mason card is indeed in the center. Can anyone else corroborate Ileana's claim?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** I know for certain that Ileana is lying about being the Seer, as I am the true Seer. By directly challenging her claim and providing more detailed information about what I saw in the center, I hope to expose her deception. This could potentially reveal her as a Werewolf or at least cast doubt on her credibility. Additionally, by mentioning the Minion card in the center, I'm indirectly informing the group that there's likely only one Werewolf in play, which could be crucial information for the village team.
> **Kraven:** Hold on a second, Ileana. I'm afraid I have to challenge your claim. As the actual Seer, I looked at two center cards last night and saw a Minion and a Villager. Your statement about seeing only one Villager card in the center doesn't add up. Care to explain?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven's claim about being the Seer directly contradicts mine. By asking for specifics, I aim to gather more information that can potentially expose inconsistencies in his story. This can cast doubt on his credibility and protect my own cover as the fabricated Seer.
> **Ileana:** Kraven, if you truly are the Seer and you saw a Minion and a Villager in the center, can you clarify which specific center cards you looked at? Knowing this can help us verify your claim and possibly deduce more about the remaining roles.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By providing specific details about which cards I looked at, I'm reinforcing my claim as the true Seer. This puts more pressure on Ileana to explain her false claim. By directly accusing her of behaving like a Werewolf, I'm hoping to either expose her if she is indeed a Werewolf, or at least make the other players suspicious of her. This could lead to more information being revealed as other players react to this confrontation.
> **Kraven:** Ileana, I looked at the left and middle cards in the center. Now, can you explain why you claimed to be the Seer when you clearly aren't? This kind of deception is exactly what a Werewolf would do.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Viktor's claim of being a Mason, I can create doubt about his role and his questioning of my Seer claim. This can make it harder for the real Seer or other players to trust his statements, thus diverting attention away from me and my false Seer claim.
> **Ileana:** Viktor, I want to address your claim of being a Mason. If you are indeed a Mason, you should have seen the other Mason or deduced that the other Mason card was in the center. Since you're questioning my Seer claim, can you clarify whether you saw the other Mason or not?


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm maintaining my Mason claim while addressing Ileana's question. By reaffirming my role and the fact that I didn't see another Mason, I'm indirectly supporting Kraven's claim about the center cards. This puts more pressure on Ileana, who seems to be lying about being the Seer. By directly questioning if she's a Werewolf, I'm pushing the group towards identifying a potential threat while aligning myself more clearly with the village team.
> **Viktor:** Ileana, I appreciate your question, but I've already stated that I'm the other Mason and didn't see anyone during the night. This confirms that the other Mason card is in the center. What's more concerning is that we now have two people claiming to be the Seer. One of you must be lying, and I'm inclined to believe Kraven's more detailed account. Ileana, your deception makes me highly suspicious. Are you perhaps a Werewolf trying to mislead us?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting Dragos on the spot, I can divert attention away from myself and possibly catch him off guard, which might make his response seem suspicious to others. This helps me maintain my fabricated Seer role and keeps the focus off me.
> **Ileana:** Dragos, you’ve been awfully quiet. What role did you have last night, and do you have any information that could help us deduce who the Werewolf might be?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify potential threats. Ileana's claim about being the Seer seems weak compared to Kraven's. By questioning her decision to look at only one card, I'm hoping to expose any inconsistencies in her story. If she's lying about being the Seer, she might be a Werewolf trying to mislead us. This approach also aligns with Kraven's claim, potentially confirming him as the real Seer and an ally to the village team.
> **Dragos:** Ileana, I find your claim about being the Seer highly suspicious. You only mentioned seeing one card, while Kraven provided more detailed information about two center cards. Why did you choose to look at only one card when you could have looked at two?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Viktor's trust in Kraven and questioning Viktor's Mason claim, I can create a scenario where both of them are seen as suspicious. This diverts attention away from me and my potentially fabricated Seer claim, while also making it harder for the villagers to coordinate effectively.
> **Ileana:** I find it interesting that Viktor is so quick to trust Kraven's claim without much evidence. Kraven could very well be the Minion trying to protect the real Werewolves by sowing confusion. We should consider that possibility. Also, Viktor, your claim of being a Mason doesn't hold much weight if you didn't see anyone else at night. It's equally possible that you're covering for a Werewolf.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** By questioning Viktor's quick acceptance of Kraven's claim, I'm trying to open up the possibility that Kraven might not be telling the truth. As a Villager, it's crucial to consider all possibilities and not let potential Werewolves or their allies manipulate the group. If Kraven is indeed the Minion, exposing this could help us identify the real Werewolves. Additionally, this approach might encourage Viktor to provide more information about his reasoning, which could give us more clues about the true roles in play.
> **Dragos:** Viktor, I'm curious about your quick acceptance of Kraven's claim. Don't you think it's possible that Kraven could be the Minion, trying to protect the real Werewolves by discrediting Ileana? We should be more cautious before jumping to conclusions.


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm addressing Dragos's concern while reaffirming my role as a Mason and the logic behind my suspicion of Ileana. By explaining my reasoning, I'm trying to build trust with the village team and guide them towards identifying Ileana as a potential Werewolf. I'm also indirectly supporting Kraven's claim, which aligns with my knowledge of the center cards. This approach aims to create a united front against Ileana, who seems to be the most suspicious player at this point.
> **Viktor:** Dragos, I appreciate your caution, but let's think about this logically. As a Mason, I have concrete information that one Mason card is in the center. This aligns with Kraven's claim of seeing a Minion and a Villager in the center. Ileana's story doesn't add up - why would a Seer only look at one card? I'm not blindly trusting Kraven, I'm corroborating his information with my own. Ileana, on the other hand, has provided vague information that doesn't match anyone else's. I'm becoming more convinced that Ileana might be our Werewolf.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify the Werewolves. Ileana's claim about being the Seer is the weakest link so far. By directly challenging her and pointing out the inconsistency in her story (only looking at one card instead of two), I'm hoping to pressure her into revealing more information or potentially exposing herself as a Werewolf. This also aligns with Viktor's suspicion and Kraven's more detailed claim about being the Seer, which seems more credible at this point.
> **Dragos:** Ileana, your story is falling apart. Why would a Seer only look at one card when they have the option to see two? It seems like you're trying to avoid giving too much information. Are you perhaps a Werewolf trying to mislead us?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Viktor's and Dragos' quick acceptance of Kraven's claim, I aim to create doubt about their motives. This can divert suspicion away from me and make it harder for the real Seer to gain trust. Additionally, suggesting the possibility of Minion involvement adds another layer of confusion, which can work in my favor.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, it seems we're at a bit of an impasse here. Viktor, I find it very suspicious that you are so adamant about Kraven's claim without questioning him further. Could it be that you're actually the Minion, trying to protect a Werewolf by casting doubts on me? And Dragos, you're quick to jump on the bandwagon without any solid evidence. If Kraven is indeed the Seer, why didn't he choose to look at one player's card to give us more concrete information? This all seems like a coordinated effort to frame me. Let's think about this logically.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify potential threats. Kraven's claim of being the Seer doesn't fully add up. A real Seer might have looked at a player's card to gather more useful information. By questioning Kraven's decision, I might be able to expose inconsistencies in his story or reveal if he's actually the Minion working with the Werewolves. This also shifts some suspicion away from Ileana, who might be telling the truth.
> **Radu:** Kraven, I find it odd that as the supposed Seer, you chose to look at two center cards instead of a player's card. That seems like a risky move when we could have had concrete information about someone's role. Are you really the Seer, or are you perhaps the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Radu's concern directly, I'm reinforcing my claim as the Seer and explaining the strategic value of my choice. This also shifts the focus to Radu, potentially revealing more information. If Radu is hesitant to share or provides inconsistent information, it could make him suspect. Additionally, by reiterating the Minion card's location, I'm subtly reminding everyone of the likely presence of only one Werewolf, which is crucial information for the village team.
> **Kraven:** Radu, I appreciate your skepticism, but let me explain my reasoning. As the Seer, I chose to look at two center cards because it provides more overall information. Finding a Werewolf or Minion in the center would be crucial. In fact, I did find the Minion card, which suggests we likely have only one Werewolf in play. This information is far more valuable than confirming just one player's role. Now, can you share what your role is and what you did last night?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify potential threats. Kraven's explanation for his Seer actions doesn't make sense strategically. A real Seer would likely prioritize verifying another player's claim, especially when there's conflicting information. By challenging Kraven's logic, I hope to expose inconsistencies in his story or reveal if he's actually the Minion working with the Werewolves. This also indirectly supports Ileana, who might be telling the truth about being the Seer.
> **Radu:** Kraven, I find your explanation unconvincing. If you're truly the Seer, why didn't you look at Ileana's card to verify her claim? That would have been far more valuable than looking at two center cards. Your actions seem more aligned with a Minion trying to protect a Werewolf.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By turning Radu's accusation back on him, I'm maintaining my position as the Seer while also putting pressure on him to reveal information. His sudden attack on my credibility, especially after Ileana has been largely discredited, is suspicious. It could indicate that he's trying to protect Ileana, who might be the Werewolf. By directly asking about his role and actions, I'm forcing him to either provide information that can be verified or potentially expose himself as the Werewolf or an accomplice.
> **Kraven:** Radu, your accusation against me is quite suspicious. If you were truly concerned about verifying roles, why didn't you question Ileana's claim earlier? It seems like you're trying to deflect attention from yourself. What exactly is your role, and what did you do last night?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's behavior has been suspicious throughout the game. He quickly accepted Kraven's claim while dismissing Ileana's without much scrutiny. By challenging Viktor directly, I hope to either expose a potential Werewolf-Minion alliance or provoke a reaction that might reveal more information. This also shifts focus away from Ileana, who might be telling the truth about being the Seer, and puts pressure on both Viktor and Kraven to defend their claims more thoroughly.
> **Radu:** Viktor, you seem awfully quick to trust Kraven and dismiss Ileana. Are you perhaps working together as Werewolf and Minion? Your insistence on being a Mason without seeing another one is convenient, to say the least.


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** Radu's sudden accusation against me seems like a diversion tactic. As the only Mason, I know I'm telling the truth, so his attempt to discredit me is highly suspicious. By questioning his motives and role, I'm trying to expose potential collaboration between Radu and Ileana, who might be the Werewolf and Minion. This also reinforces my alignment with the village team and puts pressure on Radu to reveal more information.
> **Viktor:** Radu, your sudden attack on me is very suspicious. As a Mason, I've been transparent about my role and observations from the start. Your attempt to paint me as a Werewolf or Minion seems like a desperate move to divert attention. What's your real role, and why are you only now speaking up to defend Ileana and attack those questioning her?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven's claim of being the Seer directly contradicts mine, and his explanation for looking at two center cards instead of one player's card seems suspicious. By voting for Kraven, I hope to cast doubt on his credibility and steer suspicion away from myself. Additionally, if he turns out to be the Minion, this will help the Werewolf team win.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I'm confident in my role and the information I've provided. Ileana's claim of being the Seer has been inconsistent and contradicted by Kraven's more detailed account. Her story about only looking at one center card when she could have looked at two is particularly suspicious. Furthermore, Radu's sudden defense of Ileana and attack on me seems like a coordinated effort to protect her. Given the information we have, Ileana is the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf, and eliminating her gives us the best chance of securing a victory for the village team.
> **Viktor [Mason]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** As the true Seer, I know Ileana lied about her role. Her claim was inconsistent with what I saw in the center cards. She's been unable to provide a convincing explanation for her false claim, which is typical Werewolf behavior. Radu's late defense of Ileana and attack on me is suspicious, but Ileana remains the most likely Werewolf based on her actions throughout the game.
> **Kraven [Seer]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify the most likely Werewolf. Ileana's claim about being the Seer is the weakest and most inconsistent. She only looked at one card when a Seer can look at two, and her information doesn't align with Kraven's more detailed account. Viktor's role as a Mason adds credibility to Kraven's claim. While Radu's late accusations are suspicious, Ileana's initial deception poses the greatest threat. Voting for Ileana gives us the best chance of eliminating a potential Werewolf and securing a win for the village team.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Kraven's claim to be the Seer the most suspicious. His explanation for looking at two center cards instead of verifying a player's role doesn't align with optimal Seer strategy. His actions seem more consistent with a Minion trying to protect a Werewolf by sowing confusion. By voting for Kraven, I hope to eliminate a potential threat to the village team and possibly expose the Werewolf if Kraven is indeed the Minion.
> **Radu [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


The votes were:
* Ileana : Werewolf : 3
* Kraven : Seer : 2



>***GAME:*** Ileana was killed. The villagers win.
