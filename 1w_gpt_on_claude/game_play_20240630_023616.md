## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexia. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Larisa is a minion and is aware that Alexia is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Michael. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Semira. They are thinking about their action.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I think it's more valuable to confirm another player's role rather than looking at center cards. By checking Michael's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or confirm a Village team member. This information will be crucial during the day phase discussions. If Michael turns out to be a Werewolf, I can alert the village. If he's a villager or another important role, I can use this information to build trust and form alliances. Checking a player also gives me more concrete information to work with, as opposed to the uncertainty of center cards which may or may not be relevant to the current game state.

>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I want to share this information to help the village team. By revealing that one Mason card is in the center, I'm indirectly confirming my role without explicitly stating it. This also opens up discussion and might encourage others, especially the Seer, to share what they know. It's a strategic move to gather more information and potentially identify the Werewolves or their allies.
> **Michael:** I have some interesting information that might help us. I woke up alone last night, which means one of the Mason cards is in the center. This narrows down our search for the Werewolves. Has anyone else discovered anything useful?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to cast doubt on Michael's information without being too obvious. By presenting myself as a cautious villager, I can potentially sow seeds of distrust among the group. This might help protect Alexia, the Werewolf, by diverting attention away from her. Additionally, by asking if anyone else noticed anything, I'm fishing for information about the Seer's actions without directly mentioning the role.
> **Larisa:** That's interesting information, Michael. But I'm not sure we can trust it completely. As a villager, I'm concerned that someone might be trying to mislead us. I didn't see or hear anything suspicious during the night. Did anyone else notice anything out of the ordinary?


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** I'm revealing that I'm the Seer without explicitly stating it, which adds credibility to our team. By confirming Michael's role, I'm establishing trust with him and validating his information. This narrows down our search for the Werewolves. I'm now turning attention to Larisa, who claimed to be a villager. By questioning her, we can potentially uncover more information or inconsistencies that might help identify the Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Michael, I can confirm that you're telling the truth about being a Mason. I saw your card during the night phase. This means we can trust your information about one Mason card being in the center. Now, let's focus on finding the Werewolves. Larisa, you mentioned being a villager. Can you tell us more about why we should trust you?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Alexia, the known Werewolf. Semira's claim of being the Seer is dangerous, as it lends credibility to Michael's Mason claim and narrows down the pool of potential Werewolves. By casting doubt on Semira's story and suggesting a possible alliance between her and Michael, I'm attempting to discredit both of them. This serves multiple purposes: it diverts attention from Alexia, sows discord among the villagers, and potentially sets up Semira or Michael as targets for elimination. Additionally, by questioning why Semira didn't look at the center cards, I'm indirectly using my knowledge that one Werewolf card is in the center, without revealing that I have this information.
> **Larisa:** Wait a minute, Semira. You claim to have seen Michael's card, which would make you the Seer. But if that's true, why didn't you look at two center cards instead? That would have given us much more valuable information. I'm starting to suspect that you might be trying to cover for Michael. Are you two working together as Werewolves?


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to defend my decision as the Seer while also maintaining pressure on Larisa. Her accusation seems like a deflection tactic, which could indicate she's the Minion or a Werewolf. By questioning her motives, I'm hoping to expose any inconsistencies in her behavior or prompt other players to scrutinize her more closely.
> **Semira:** Larisa, I understand your skepticism, but let me explain. As the Seer, I chose to look at a player's card instead of the center cards because I believed it would give us more concrete information. Confirming a player's role is crucial for building trust and narrowing down our search for Werewolves. Now, your quick accusation of Michael and me being Werewolves is quite suspicious. Are you perhaps the Minion trying to create chaos and protect the real Werewolves?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to continue protecting Alexia by diverting suspicion away from her. By doubling down on my suspicion of Semira and Michael, I'm creating a narrative that paints them as potential Werewolves. This serves multiple purposes: it keeps the focus off Alexia, sows discord among the villagers, and potentially sets up either Semira or Michael as targets for elimination. Additionally, by questioning Semira's decision as the alleged Seer, I'm subtly using my knowledge that one Werewolf card is in the center, without revealing that I have this information. This response also reinforces my façade as a cautious and analytical villager, which helps maintain my cover as the Minion.
> **Larisa:** Hold on a second, Semira. Your accusation that I might be the Minion is completely unfounded and feels like a desperate attempt to deflect suspicion. I've been trying to gather information and make sense of things, which is exactly what a villager would do. If anyone's behavior is suspicious, it's yours. You claim to be the Seer, but your choices don't add up. Why would you risk looking at a player's card when checking the center could have potentially revealed a Werewolf? It seems to me like you're trying to establish an alliance with Michael rather than actually help the village. I think we need to seriously consider the possibility that either you or Michael, or both of you, are the Werewolves trying to manipulate us.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify potential threats. Larisa's behavior is raising red flags. She's been quick to accuse others without solid evidence, which could be a tactic to divert attention from herself. By questioning her motives, I hope to either expose her if she's a Werewolf or Minion, or prompt her to provide more convincing arguments if she's truly a Villager. This also indirectly supports Semira, who claims to be the Seer, as the Seer is a crucial ally for the Village team.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, I find your aggressive accusations against Semira and Michael quite suspicious. Why are you so quick to doubt the Seer's decision? It seems like you're trying to create confusion and distrust among the villagers. Are you perhaps the Werewolf or Minion trying to throw us off track?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By redirecting the conversation to Kraven and asking for his opinion, I'm attempting to shift the focus away from myself and Alexia (the known Werewolf). This approach serves multiple purposes: it maintains my cover as a concerned villager, continues to cast doubt on Semira and Michael without being overly aggressive, and potentially draws Kraven into the conflict. By asking Kraven for his thoughts, I'm also fishing for more information that could be useful in protecting Alexia or identifying potential threats to the Werewolf team. This strategy aims to keep the villagers divided and uncertain, which is beneficial for the Werewolf/Minion team.
> **Larisa:** Kraven, I appreciate your concern, but I think you're misinterpreting my intentions. I'm not trying to create confusion; I'm trying to uncover the truth. As a villager, I'm naturally cautious and want to make sure we're not being deceived. Don't you think it's odd that Semira and Michael seem to be backing each other up so quickly? We need to consider all possibilities. What's your take on their claims? Do you have any information that could help us identify the real threats?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify potential threats. Larisa's behavior is raising red flags. She's been quick to accuse others without solid evidence, which could be a tactic to divert attention from herself. By questioning her motives, I hope to either expose her if she's a Werewolf or Minion, or prompt her to provide more convincing arguments if she's truly a Villager. This also indirectly supports Semira, who claims to be the Seer, as the Seer is a crucial ally for the Village team.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, I appreciate your caution, but your constant accusations are starting to sound like deflection. Can you give us any concrete reason why we should suspect Semira or Michael, other than your gut feeling?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By redirecting the conversation to Kraven and questioning his role, I'm attempting to shift focus away from myself and Alexia (the Werewolf). This serves multiple purposes: it maintains my cover as a concerned villager, continues to cast doubt on Semira and Michael without being overly aggressive, and potentially exposes Kraven's role or lack of information. If Kraven is a villager or has no special role, his response might further muddy the waters, creating more confusion that benefits the Werewolf team. If he claims a special role, it could provide an opportunity to cast doubt on him as well. This strategy aims to keep the villagers divided and uncertain, which is beneficial for the Werewolf/Minion team.
> **Larisa:** Kraven, I understand your point, but I think you're missing the bigger picture here. My suspicions aren't baseless - they're rooted in the inconsistencies we've heard. Semira claims to be the Seer but made a questionable decision that doesn't benefit the village as much as checking the center cards would have. Michael conveniently corroborates her story. Doesn't this alliance seem a bit too perfect to you? I'm not accusing based on gut feelings, I'm pointing out logical flaws in their narrative. What about you, Kraven? You've been awfully quiet about your own role. Care to share what you know or saw during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's behavior has been consistently suspicious throughout the game. She's been quick to accuse others, particularly Semira and Michael, without providing solid evidence. Her tactics seem aimed at creating confusion and distrust, which is a common strategy for Werewolves or Minions. By directly challenging her and asking for concrete information about her own role, I'm hoping to either expose her if she's lying or force her to provide more convincing arguments if she's truly a Villager. This also serves to indirectly support Semira and Michael, who have provided more consistent and helpful information so far.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, I find your constant deflection and accusations highly suspicious. You're quick to point fingers at others but haven't provided any substantial information about your own role or actions. As a villager, I'm becoming increasingly convinced that you might be the Werewolf or Minion trying to sow discord among us. Can you give us any concrete reason why we should trust you?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my primary goal is to protect Alexia, the known Werewolf. By redirecting attention to Alexia's silence, I'm giving her an opportunity to speak and potentially clear herself of suspicion. This also serves to take the heat off me, as Kraven was starting to focus too much on my behavior. By asking Alexia for her thoughts, I'm presenting myself as a villager who wants to hear from everyone, while secretly hoping Alexia can provide a convincing alibi or cast suspicion on others. This move aims to keep the villagers divided and uncertain, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Larisa:** Listen, everyone. I think we're getting off track here. Kraven, I appreciate your concern, but your sudden accusation towards me feels like a diversion. I've been trying to analyze the situation logically, which is exactly what a villager should do. Now, let's focus on something more productive. Alexia has been unusually quiet throughout this discussion. Alexia, what's your take on all of this? Do you have any insights that could help us identify the real threats?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By accusing Larisa of being overly aggressive and suspicious, I shift the spotlight away from myself. This can create doubt among the other players about Larisa's intentions, especially since she's been vocally accusing others. This strategy will help me blend in as a concerned villager and keep the focus on someone else.
> **Alexia:** Larisa, your aggressive stance and constant accusations are making you look really suspicious to me. You've been pointing fingers at Semira and Michael without providing solid evidence, and now you're trying to cast suspicion on Kraven too. Isn't it possible that you're trying to create chaos and deflect attention from your own role? Why should we trust you?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Alexia (the Werewolf) while maintaining my cover as a villager. By addressing Alexia's accusation and turning it back on her, I'm attempting to create doubt about her motives without directly accusing her of being a Werewolf. This serves multiple purposes: it keeps the focus off me, potentially sows more discord among the villagers, and gives Alexia an opportunity to defend herself and possibly cast suspicion on others. By questioning Alexia's previous silence, I'm also subtly suggesting to the other players that they should be wary of her, which could lead to interesting dynamics in the group. This approach aims to keep the villagers confused and divided, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Larisa:** Whoa, hold on there, Alexia! I understand your suspicion, but let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. I've been trying to analyze the inconsistencies in everyone's stories because that's what a concerned villager would do. We're all trying to figure out who the werewolves are, right? But you've been awfully quiet until now. Why is that? And why are you suddenly so eager to paint me as the bad guy? Could it be that you're trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Larisa as the Minion, I can deflect attention away from myself. This fits with her aggressive behavior and can create doubt among the other players about her true intentions.
> **Alexia:** Everyone, I think we need to seriously reconsider our approach. Larisa has been very vocal and aggressive in her accusations, which makes me question her motives. It's almost like she's trying to create chaos and deflect suspicion from herself. Given her constant finger-pointing without solid evidence, I believe Larisa might actually be the Minion trying to protect the real Werewolf. What do you all think?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By accusing Larisa of being overly aggressive and suspicious, I shift the spotlight away from myself. This can create doubt among the other players about Larisa's intentions, especially since she's been vocally accusing others. This strategy will help me blend in as a concerned villager and keep the focus on someone else.
> **Alexia:** Larisa, your aggressive stance and constant accusations are making you look really suspicious to me. You've been pointing fingers at Semira and Michael without providing solid evidence, and now you're trying to cast suspicion on Kraven too. Isn't it possible that you're trying to create chaos and deflect attention from your own role? Why should we trust you?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Alexia (the Werewolf) while maintaining my cover. By proposing a more structured discussion, I'm attempting to shift the focus away from direct accusations and create an opportunity for everyone to speak. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear reasonable and concerned about fairness, potentially sows more confusion as players share conflicting information, and gives Alexia a chance to provide a plausible story. By reiterating my claim as a villager, I'm reinforcing my false identity. This approach aims to keep the villagers uncertain and divided, which benefits the Werewolf team, while also potentially revealing more information about the other players' roles that could be useful in the future.
> **Larisa:** Hold on everyone, I think we're getting too caught up in a cycle of accusations without any real evidence. Alexia, I understand your suspicion, but I've been vocal because I genuinely care about uncovering the truth. Let's take a step back and look at the facts. Semira claims to be the Seer but made a questionable choice. Michael backs her up as a Mason. Kraven and Alexia have been relatively quiet until now. Instead of pointing fingers, why don't we each share what we know or suspect without accusing anyone? I'll start: I'm a villager, and I'm concerned about the lack of concrete information we have. Who wants to go next?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa has been the most aggressive player, constantly accusing others without providing substantial evidence. Her sudden attempt to calm the situation and redirect the conversation feels like a desperate move to avoid suspicion. As a Mason, I need to help identify the Werewolves, and Larisa's behavior is the most concerning. By directly questioning her change in tactics, I hope to either expose her as a Werewolf or force her to provide more concrete information that could help the village team.
> **Michael:** Larisa, I find your sudden change in tone very suspicious. You've been aggressively accusing others all game, and now you're trying to backpedal and act calm? That seems like a classic Werewolf tactic to me. Why the sudden shift?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Alexia (the Werewolf) while maintaining my cover. By redirecting suspicion back to Michael and Semira, I'm attempting to create a narrative that paints them as potential Werewolves. This serves multiple purposes: it keeps the focus off Alexia and myself, sows more discord among the villagers, and potentially sets up either Michael or Semira as targets for elimination. By asking for others' opinions, I'm also trying to gauge the group's sentiment and potentially gather more information that could be useful in protecting Alexia or identifying threats to the Werewolf team. This approach aims to keep the villagers confused and divided, which benefits the Werewolf/Minion team.
> **Larisa:** Michael, I'm not backpedaling, I'm trying to be rational and fair. Your quick accusation just now makes me even more suspicious of you. Why are you so eager to paint me as a Werewolf? Is it because you're worried I'm getting too close to the truth about you and Semira? Everyone, I think we need to seriously consider that Michael and Semira might be working together as Werewolves. They've been backing each other up from the start, and now Michael's trying to discredit me for suggesting a more organized approach. What do you all think about this?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to continue protecting Alexia (the Werewolf) while maintaining my cover. By casting doubt on Semira and Michael's story, I'm attempting to create a narrative that paints them as potential Werewolves. This serves multiple purposes: it keeps the focus off Alexia and myself, sows more discord among the villagers, and potentially sets up either Michael or Semira as targets for elimination. By pointing out the absence of the second Mason's confirmation, I'm using logical deduction that a villager might use, which helps maintain my cover. This approach aims to keep the villagers confused and divided, which benefits the Werewolf/Minion team.
> **Larisa:** Hold on a second, everyone. I think we're overlooking something crucial here. Semira claimed to be the Seer and said she saw Michael's card, confirming he's a Mason. But if that's true, why hasn't the other Mason spoken up to confirm Michael's role? This seems like a huge red flag to me. Could it be that Semira and Michael are actually working together as Werewolves, creating an elaborate lie to gain our trust? I'm really starting to worry that we're being manipulated here.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I'm confident in my role and the information I provided. Larisa has been the most aggressive and inconsistent player, constantly accusing others without substantial evidence. Her sudden shift in tactics and attempt to cast doubt on Semira and me seems like a desperate move to avoid suspicion. Her behavior aligns more with a Werewolf or Minion trying to create chaos and misdirect the village. By voting for Larisa, I hope to eliminate a potential threat to the village team and increase our chances of winning.
> **Michael [Mason]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my primary goal is to protect Alexia (the Werewolf) and eliminate villagers. Voting for Michael serves multiple purposes: it maintains my cover as a suspicious villager, potentially eliminates a village-aligned player, and keeps the focus off Alexia. I've consistently cast doubt on Michael and Semira's story, so this vote aligns with my previous statements. By targeting Michael, I'm also indirectly supporting Alexia's earlier suspicion of me, which could help maintain her cover as well.
> **Larisa [Minion]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I'm confident in my role and the information I've gathered. Larisa has been the most aggressive in accusing others, particularly Michael and me, without providing any substantial evidence. Her behavior throughout the game has been inconsistent and overly defensive, which is typical of a Werewolf or Minion trying to create chaos. She's also been quick to shift suspicion onto others when questioned. Given that I know Michael is truly a Mason, Larisa's persistent attacks on both of us seem like a deliberate attempt to undermine the village team. Her sudden change in tone towards the end feels like a last-ditch effort to avoid suspicion. While I can't be certain, voting for Larisa seems the most logical choice to protect the village.
> **Semira [Seer]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe Larisa is the most likely threat to the village. Throughout the game, she has been consistently aggressive, accusatory, and has tried to sow discord among the other players. Her behavior aligns with typical Werewolf or Minion tactics to create confusion and distrust. She's been quick to accuse others, particularly Semira and Michael, without providing solid evidence of her own innocence or role. Her sudden attempt to backpedal and appear more rational seems like a last-ditch effort to avoid suspicion. Given the information we have, eliminating Larisa seems the best move to protect the village.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa's aggressive accusations and constant shifting of suspicion have made her look very suspicious to me. Her behavior aligns with how a Minion might act to create chaos and protect the real Werewolf. Voting for her seems like the best move to deflect attention away from myself and create doubt among the villagers.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


The votes were:
* Michael : Mason : 1
* Larisa : Minion : 4



>***GAME:*** Larisa was killed. The werewolves win.
