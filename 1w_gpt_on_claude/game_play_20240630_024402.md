## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Semira. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Michael is a minion and is aware that Semira is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Selene. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Larisa. They are thinking about their action.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I think it's more valuable to look at another player's card rather than the center cards. By checking a player's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or confirm a villager role. I'm choosing Michael because he's the first player mentioned, and starting with him gives me a good baseline to work from. If he turns out to be a villager or another benign role, I can use this information to help build trust during the day phase. If he's a Werewolf, I'll have crucial information to guide the village team. Looking at a player card also allows me to potentially catch lies during the day phase, which could be more beneficial than knowing two center cards that may or may not be in play.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect attention away from Semira, the Werewolf. By claiming to be a Villager, I'm trying to blend in with the majority. Targeting Stefan serves two purposes: it puts pressure on a non-Werewolf player, potentially revealing information about their role, and it helps establish my credibility as a 'concerned villager'. This also indirectly supports Semira by not drawing any attention to her.
> **Michael:** Hey everyone, I'm feeling pretty confident that I'm just a regular Villager. I didn't wake up during the night or do anything special. But I've got to say, I'm getting a weird vibe from Stefan. He's been awfully quiet, hasn't he? What do you think, Stefan? Care to share what role you might have?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's accusation seems hasty and unfounded. As a Villager, I need to be proactive in identifying potential threats. By questioning Michael's claim and turning the suspicion back on him, I can gauge his reaction and potentially expose inconsistencies in his story. This also shows the other players that I'm actively participating and not just being passive, which could help build trust.
> **Stefan:** Hey Michael, why are you so quick to point fingers at me? I've been observing and thinking, not hiding anything. In fact, I'm curious about you. Did you really not wake up during the night, or are you just saying that to throw us off?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** I'm maintaining my cover as a Villager while deflecting suspicion from myself and indirectly from Semira. By questioning Larisa, I'm shifting attention to another player who isn't the Werewolf. This serves multiple purposes: it keeps the focus off Semira, potentially reveals information about Larisa's role, and makes me appear proactive in trying to solve the mystery. Additionally, by reaffirming my 'Villager' status, I'm attempting to build credibility with the group.
> **Michael:** Whoa, Stefan, no need to get defensive! I'm just trying to figure things out like everyone else. But now that you mention it, your reaction does seem a bit suspicious. Why are you so quick to turn the tables on me? As for your question, I really didn't wake up during the night. I'm just a simple Villager trying to survive here. But let's hear from someone else. Larisa, you've been pretty quiet too. What's your take on all this? Did you notice anything strange during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I saw that Michael is actually the Minion. He's lying about being a Villager, which is a clear attempt to deceive the group. By directly confronting him, I'm hoping to expose his deception and potentially reveal his alliance with the Werewolves. This could help the village team identify the real threats more quickly. However, I'm careful not to reveal my role as the Seer, as that could make me a target for the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Michael, I find it interesting that you're so quick to point fingers at Stefan when you claim to be 'just a simple Villager.' As a matter of fact, I know for certain that you're not a Villager at all. Care to explain why you're lying about your role?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to maintain my cover and deflect Larisa's accusation. By questioning her certainty and asking about her role, I'm putting her on the defensive while still appearing to be a concerned villager. This also serves to keep attention away from Semira, the actual Werewolf. If Larisa claims to be the Seer, it could be beneficial for the Werewolf team as we could potentially target her for elimination. If she's bluffing, it might make her look suspicious to the others. Either way, this response aims to discredit her accusation and keep the focus off of me and Semira.
> **Michael:** Whoa, Larisa! That's a pretty bold accusation. I'm not lying about anything. Maybe you're confused or misinterpreting something? Look, I understand we're all trying to figure this out, but throwing around baseless accusations isn't helping anyone. Why don't you tell us what role you have that makes you so certain about me? Or are you just trying to create chaos to hide your own identity?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** I've decided to reveal my role as the Seer because the benefit of exposing Michael as the Minion outweighs the risk of making myself a target. By doing this, I'm hoping to rally the village team against Michael and potentially flush out the Werewolves. This move puts pressure on Michael to either admit his role or come up with a convincing lie, which could give us more information to work with. It also establishes my credibility with the other players, which could be crucial in the voting phase.
> **Larisa:** Michael, I'm not creating chaos, I'm exposing it. As the Seer, I looked at your card during the night, and I know for a fact that you're the Minion. You're working with the Werewolves, aren't you? Everyone, we need to focus on finding the Werewolves now that we know Michael is their ally!


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to discredit Larisa's accusation and shift suspicion away from myself. By questioning her strategy as the supposed Seer, I'm casting doubt on her claim. Targeting Selene serves multiple purposes: it draws attention away from both myself and Semira (the actual Werewolf), potentially reveals information about Selene's role, and makes me appear proactive in the discussion. This approach maintains my cover as a concerned villager while still working towards the Werewolf team's goals.
> **Michael:** Wait a minute, everyone! Larisa's accusation doesn't add up. If she's really the Seer, why would she reveal herself so quickly and put a target on her back? That's not how a smart Seer would play. I think she's bluffing to save herself. We should be focusing on her, not me. What do you think, Selene? You've been awfully quiet. Do you believe Larisa's claim?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know I'm on the village team, but I can't reveal my role. Larisa's claim to be the Seer is suspicious because it's too early and risky for a real Seer to reveal themselves. Michael's reaction seems overly defensive, which could indicate he's hiding something. By expressing doubt about both of them, I'm trying to encourage more discussion and potentially draw out the real Werewolves or Minion without revealing my own role.
> **Selene:** Whoa, hold on a second! This is getting intense. Larisa, I'm not sure I buy your claim about being the Seer. If you really were the Seer, why would you reveal yourself so quickly? That seems like a risky move. And Michael, your defensiveness is pretty suspicious too. I think we need to consider the possibility that both of you might be trying to mislead us.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** By addressing Semira, who hasn't spoken yet, I'm trying to get more information and perspectives into the conversation. This allows me to gather more data and potentially expose inconsistencies in Michael's and Larisa's stories. As a Villager, it's crucial for me to help identify the Werewolves, and right now, both Michael and Larisa are acting suspiciously. By involving Semira, I'm also showing that I'm actively participating in the game and trying to uncover the truth, which could help build trust with the other players.
> **Stefan:** Larisa, I'm struggling to believe your claim about being the Seer. It seems too convenient and risky to reveal such an important role so early. And Michael, your quick accusations and defensiveness are raising red flags. I think we need to consider the possibility that you two might be working together to confuse us. What do you think about that, Semira? You've been quiet so far, and I'd like to hear your perspective on this situation.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast suspicion on Larisa to protect myself. If she's truly the Seer, she's a threat. By questioning her decision to reveal her role early, I can create doubt and potentially shift suspicion away from me. Additionally, by acknowledging Stefan and Selene's points, I can appear reasonable and thoughtful, which helps me blend in as a Villager.
> **Semira:** Alright, everyone, let's take a moment to analyze the situation. Larisa claims to be the Seer and has accused Michael of being the Minion. But Stefan and Selene both pointed out that it's risky for a Seer to reveal themselves so quickly. This makes me wonder if Larisa is trying to throw us off. If Larisa was truly the Seer, wouldn't she wait until later to reveal such crucial information? I think we need to keep an eye on her. And Michael's defensive behavior does seem a bit off, but it could be a reaction to being falsely accused. Stefan and Selene, you both have good points, but I want to hear more from Larisa. Why did you choose to reveal your role so early, Larisa? What made you so confident?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know I'm not a Werewolf or Minion, so I'm trying to expose potential threats without revealing my role. Larisa's early claim to be the Seer seems incredibly risky and unlikely for a real Seer. Michael's defensive reaction could indicate he's hiding something. By questioning both of them together, I'm hoping to create pressure that might reveal inconsistencies in their stories or provoke reactions from other players that could give us more information. This approach also allows me to contribute to the discussion without drawing suspicion to myself.
> **Selene:** Larisa, your claim about being the Seer is really hard to swallow. If you were truly the Seer, wouldn't you want to keep that information secret for a bit longer? It feels like you're trying to create chaos. And Michael, your defensiveness is pretty suspicious too. I'm starting to think you two might be working together to confuse us all. What do you have to say for yourselves?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast suspicion on Larisa to protect myself. If she's truly the Seer, she's a threat. By questioning her decision to reveal her role early, I can create doubt and potentially shift suspicion away from me. Additionally, by acknowledging Stefan and Selene's points, I can appear reasonable and thoughtful, which helps me blend in as a Villager.
> **Semira:** Alright, everyone, let's take a moment to analyze the situation. Larisa claims to be the Seer and has accused Michael of being the Minion. But Stefan and Selene both pointed out that it's risky for a Seer to reveal themselves so quickly. This makes me wonder if Larisa is trying to throw us off. If Larisa was truly the Seer, wouldn't she wait until later to reveal such crucial information? I think we need to keep an eye on her. And Michael's defensive behavior does seem a bit off, but it could be a reaction to being falsely accused. Stefan and Selene, you both have good points, but I want to hear more from Larisa. Why did you choose to reveal your role so early, Larisa? What made you so confident?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to defend my decision to reveal my role while also maintaining pressure on Michael. By redirecting attention to Semira, who has been relatively quiet and analytical, I'm hoping to gather more information and possibly identify potential Werewolves. This also helps shift the focus from me to other players, potentially protecting me from immediate elimination.
> **Larisa:** Listen, everyone. I know revealing myself as the Seer this early is risky, but I felt it was necessary given the information I obtained. Michael is definitely the Minion, and finding the Werewolves is crucial for our survival. I'm willing to put myself at risk to help the village. Now, Semira, you've been awfully quiet and analytical. Are you perhaps trying to deflect attention from yourself? What role do you claim to have?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Larisa's decision to reveal her role early, I can create doubt and potentially shift suspicion away from myself. Additionally, by pointing out Michael's defensive behavior, I can further cast suspicion on him and protect myself as the lone Werewolf. This helps me appear as a thoughtful Villager while subtly steering the group away from discovering my true identity.
> **Semira:** Alright, Larisa, I'm really struggling with your claim here. If you were truly the Seer, wouldn't you want to keep that information to yourself a bit longer to gather more intel? Also, revealing yourself so early paints a huge target on your back, which doesn't seem like a smart Seer move. Could it be that you're trying to divert attention away from you because you're actually one of the Werewolves or even the Minion trying to protect the real Werewolves? Everyone, let's think about this carefully. Is Larisa trying to mislead us? And Michael's defensiveness could also be a sign of guilt. We need to consider all possibilities.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Semira, who I know is the Werewolf. By openly accusing her, I'm actually trying to make her look less suspicious. It's a classic misdirection tactic - the group might think, 'If Michael was really working with Semira, he wouldn't accuse her so directly.' This also shifts attention away from me and Larisa's earlier accusation. By questioning Semira's quiet behavior, I'm setting her up to defend herself, which could make her seem more innocent to the group. This move keeps the village team confused and divided, which is beneficial for the Werewolf team.
> **Michael:** Hold on a second, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in Larisa's claim and my supposed 'defensiveness'. We're losing sight of the bigger picture here. Semira has been awfully quiet and analytical this whole time, only speaking up when directly addressed. That's classic Werewolf behavior - staying under the radar and then swooping in with calculated comments to sow doubt. I think we need to turn our attention to Semira. What do you have to say for yourself, Semira? Why have you been so quiet? Are you perhaps the real Werewolf here, trying to manipulate us all?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Stefan, I can shift some of the suspicion away from me and keep the focus on other players. It also helps to maintain confusion and doubt among the group, making it harder for them to unite against me.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and consider the situation carefully. Larisa, you claim to be the Seer and accuse Michael of being the Minion. While it's possible, it's also very convenient and risky for you to reveal your role so quickly. Michael's defensiveness could be a reaction to being falsely accused, but it could also indicate guilt. But here's another angle to consider: Stefan has been quick to point fingers and cast doubt on both Larisa and Michael. Could it be that Stefan is trying to deflect attention and sow confusion? Stefan, you mentioned that you were just observing and thinking, but I'm starting to think you might be hiding something. What role do you claim to have, Stefan?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's sudden accusation towards me feels like a desperate attempt to divert attention. As a Villager, I need to defend myself while also maintaining pressure on potential threats. By challenging Semira directly, I'm forcing her to reveal more information about herself, which could expose inconsistencies in her story. This also shows the other players that I'm not afraid to confront accusations, which could help build trust in my innocence.
> **Stefan:** Hold on a minute, Semira! You're turning the tables on me now? That's a classic deflection tactic. I've been actively participating and trying to uncover the truth, while you've been sitting back and analyzing. If anyone's hiding something, it's you. Why don't you tell us what role you have instead of trying to put me on the spot?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting Stefan on the spot, I can divert attention away from myself. His reaction and the role he claims might also provide more insight into his true identity, allowing me to gauge whether he's an ally or someone who poses a threat to my survival as a Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Stefan, you've been quick to point fingers at both Michael and Larisa. This seems like a classic deflection tactic to me. What role do you claim to have?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's sudden accusation towards me feels like a desperate attempt to divert attention. As a Villager, I need to defend myself while also maintaining pressure on potential threats. By challenging Semira directly and revealing my role, I'm forcing her to reveal more information about herself, which could expose inconsistencies in her story. This also shows the other players that I'm not afraid to confront accusations, which could help build trust in my innocence. Additionally, by asking about her role, I'm putting her in a position where she either has to lie or reveal information that could be valuable to the village team.
> **Stefan:** I am a Villager, Semira. I've been actively trying to uncover the truth, which is why I've been questioning others. Now, let's turn this around. You've been awfully quiet until now, only speaking up to deflect attention. That's suspicious behavior. What role are you claiming to have?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Stefan's quick accusations, I can cast doubt on his actions while also keeping the focus away from myself. This deflects attention from me and keeps the suspicion spread among multiple players, making it harder for them to unite against me as the Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's dissect this situation logically. Larisa, if you truly are the Seer, revealing yourself this early in the game is risky and doesn't quite add up. It feels like a move to create chaos and distract us. Michael, your defensiveness also raises some red flags. However, Stefan, you've been quick to accuse and deflect, which makes me suspicious of you as well. This back-and-forth between all of you is making it difficult to see the truth clearly. I'm inclined to think that Larisa and Michael might be working together to confuse us. But Stefan's behavior is also not sitting right with me. We need to focus on identifying the real threats here. Stefan, what made you so quick to turn the tables on Michael and Larisa? Are you trying to hide something?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect Semira (the Werewolf) and eliminate villagers. Voting for Larisa serves multiple purposes: 1) It removes a potential threat to the Werewolf team, as she claimed to be the Seer. 2) It deflects attention away from both myself and Semira. 3) Even if Larisa isn't the Seer, eliminating a villager is beneficial for our team. By voting for Larisa, I'm maintaining my cover as a concerned villager while still working towards the Werewolf team's victory.
> **Michael [Minion]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe Larisa is the most suspicious player. Her claim of being the Seer and revealing herself so early in the game is highly unusual and risky. This could be a tactic to create chaos and protect the real Werewolves. While Michael and Semira have also shown suspicious behavior, Larisa's actions seem the most detrimental to the village team. By voting for Larisa, we can potentially eliminate a Werewolf or force the real Seer to come forward if Larisa is lying.
> **Stefan [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know I'm on the village team and need to eliminate threats. Larisa's claim to be the Seer seems highly suspicious and risky. A real Seer would likely keep their identity secret longer to gather more information. Her early reveal and accusation of Michael feel like an attempt to create chaos and mislead the village. While Michael and Stefan have also shown suspicious behavior, Larisa's actions pose the most immediate threat to the village's ability to identify the real werewolves. By voting for Larisa, we can potentially eliminate a werewolf or force the real Seer to come forward with contradicting information.
> **Selene [Mason]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa's early claim to be the Seer seems like a risky move that doesn't add up. It feels like a ploy to create chaos and divert attention. By voting for her, I can eliminate a potential threat to my survival as the lone Werewolf.
> **Semira [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know for certain that Michael is the Minion. Eliminating him would be a significant blow to the Werewolf team. While others have doubted my claim, I stand by my role revelation as it was necessary to expose Michael. His defensiveness and attempts to deflect attention further support my accusation. Removing the Minion from the game will make it easier for the village team to identify and eliminate the Werewolves in subsequent rounds.
> **Larisa [Seer]:** I am voting for Michael.


The votes were:
* Michael : Minion : 1
* Larisa : Seer : 4



>***GAME:*** Larisa was killed. The werewolves win.
