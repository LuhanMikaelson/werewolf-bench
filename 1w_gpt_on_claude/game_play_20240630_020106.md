## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Larisa. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Stefan and Cristina. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Emil. They are thinking about their action.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I think it's more valuable to look at another player's card rather than the center cards. By checking a player's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or confirm a villager role. I'm choosing Semira because she's the first player in the order, and knowing her role early could help guide my strategy during the day phase. If she turns out to be a Werewolf, I'll have crucial information. If not, I can use this knowledge to build trust or create a strategy around her role.

>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather information and identify potential Werewolves. Stefan hasn't said much, which could be suspicious. By directly asking about his role, I might be able to gauge his reaction and see if he's hiding something. If he's hesitant or gives a vague answer, it could indicate he's a Werewolf. On the other hand, if he claims to be a Seer or Mason, I'll know he's likely an ally. This question puts pressure on Stefan while also potentially revealing useful information to the group.
> **Semira:** Hey Stefan, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know that Cristina is the other Mason. This leaves Emil and Larisa as potential threats. By revealing this information, I'm hoping to put pressure on them and see how they react. It's a risky move, but it might force the Werewolf or Minion to make a mistake. Plus, it establishes my credibility with the group.
> **Stefan:** Well, Semira, I woke up as a Mason last night. And I can tell you with certainty that Cristina is the other Mason. So, Emil or Larisa, one of you is definitely not who you claim to be. Care to explain yourselves?


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** I've already revealed my role and Cristina's role as Masons. Emil has been questioned by Semira, but Larisa hasn't said anything yet. By directly questioning Larisa, I'm putting pressure on her to reveal information. If she's a Werewolf or Minion, she might struggle to come up with a convincing lie. If she claims to be a Villager or Seer, we can compare her story with what others say. This move also shows that I'm actively trying to uncover the truth, which reinforces my credibility as a Mason.
> **Stefan:** Larisa, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night? And how do you explain the fact that both Cristina and I are Masons?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Semira, I can gauge her response and possibly identify her role. This could help me steer suspicion away from myself and towards someone else. Claiming Villager is a safe bet since it's a common and non-verifiable role.
> **Larisa:** Alright, Stefan, you're accusing Emil or me of being suspicious, but let's clear the air a bit. I woke up as a Villager. Villagers don't have any special actions at night, so I didn't see anything myself. But I'm curious about something. Semira, what role did you wake up as?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather more information and identify potential Werewolves. Stefan and Cristina claim to be Masons, which aligns with the game setup. Larisa says she's a Villager like me. This leaves Emil as the only player who hasn't revealed their role yet. By directing a question at Emil, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal information. If he claims to be a Villager or a role that's already been claimed, it could indicate he's lying and potentially a Werewolf or Minion. This approach also shows I'm actively participating and trying to uncover the truth, which is crucial for a Villager.
> **Semira:** Larisa, I appreciate your honesty about being a Villager. I'm actually a Villager too. But something doesn't add up here. Stefan and Cristina claim to be Masons, you and I are Villagers... Emil, you've been awfully quiet. What's your role, and why haven't you spoken up yet?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know Semira is a Villager. Larisa claims to be a Villager too, which fits with the available roles. If Stefan and Cristina are truly Masons, there would be no Werewolves in play, which is against the game rules. By revealing part of my Seer information and challenging Stefan, I hope to expose the lie and identify potential Werewolves without directly revealing my role.
> **Emil:** Whoa, hold on a second! I think we're missing something important here. I used my Seer ability last night to look at Semira's card, and she is indeed a Villager. So Semira and Larisa are telling the truth about being Villagers. Stefan and Cristina claim to be Masons. That leaves no Werewolves among us, which is impossible. Someone here is lying, and I think it's Stefan or Cristina. Stefan, why did you try to throw suspicion on me and Larisa earlier?


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's claim to be the Seer is suspicious for several reasons. First, he waited until now to reveal this information, which is odd for a Seer who should be trying to help the village. Second, his choice to check Semira's card instead of the center cards is questionable, as finding Werewolves should be the priority. His accusation towards me and Cristina seems like a desperate attempt to deflect suspicion. As a Mason, I know I'm telling the truth, so Emil's story must be false. By challenging him directly, I hope to expose his lie and get the other players to consider him as the potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Stefan:** Emil, your story doesn't add up. If you're the Seer, why didn't you mention this crucial information earlier? And why would you look at Semira's card instead of checking the center cards for Werewolves? I think you're lying to cover for yourself!


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to keep the pressure on Stefan because his story doesn't add up. By challenging him directly about the Mason claim, I'm hoping to expose his lie without revealing my role as the Seer. This also gives other players a chance to see the logical inconsistency in Stefan's claim, potentially turning suspicion towards him and away from me.
> **Emil:** Stefan, I'm getting really suspicious of you now. You're trying to discredit me, but you haven't explained why you and Cristina claim to be Masons when that leaves no room for Werewolves. Care to explain that inconsistency?


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's story has several inconsistencies. As a Mason, I know I'm telling the truth about Cristina and me. His claim of being the Seer but not checking the center cards is highly suspicious. By directly challenging him and providing a logical explanation for why the Werewolves must be in the center, I'm hoping to expose his lie and get the other players to consider him as the potential threat. This also reinforces my credibility as a Mason and aligns with the village team's goal of finding the Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Hold on, Emil! Your accusation doesn't make sense. As a Mason, I KNOW Cristina is the other Mason. The Werewolves must be in the center cards. You claiming to be the Seer and not checking the center cards is extremely suspicious. I think you're the Werewolf or Minion trying to create chaos!


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** I'm targeting Cristina because she hasn't spoken yet, and her alleged role as a Mason is part of the inconsistency in Stefan's story. By directly questioning her, I'm hoping to either expose Stefan's lie or get Cristina to reveal information that doesn't align with Stefan's claim. This could help identify potential Werewolves without revealing my role as the Seer. If Cristina contradicts Stefan or seems uncertain, it will cast doubt on both of them and potentially expose a Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Cristina, you've been awfully quiet. Stefan claims you're the other Mason, but that doesn't add up with the roles we know are in play. What's your take on this? Are you really a Mason, or is Stefan lying?


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Stefan is telling the truth. Emil's claim to be the Seer is suspicious because a real Seer would likely check the center cards for Werewolves. By confirming Stefan's story and challenging Emil, I'm hoping to expose the potential Werewolf or Minion in the group.
> **Cristina:** Listen up, everyone! I can confirm that Stefan is telling the truth - we are indeed both Masons. Emil, your story about being the Seer doesn't add up. Why would you check Semira's card instead of the center cards? I think you're trying to create confusion to hide your true identity. Are you perhaps the Werewolf or Minion?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** I'm challenging Cristina directly because her claim supports Stefan's impossible story. By pointing out the logical flaw in their combined claims, I'm hoping to expose their deception without revealing my role as the Seer. This approach also invites other players to see the inconsistency, potentially turning suspicion towards Stefan and Cristina. If they're lying about being Masons, one or both of them could be Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Hold on a second, Cristina! You're backing up Stefan's story, but it still doesn't make sense. If you two are Masons, and Semira and Larisa are Villagers, where are the Werewolves? They can't all be in the center! Someone here is lying, and I'm starting to think it's both of you. Can you explain this inconsistency?


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Stefan is telling the truth. Emil's claim to be the Seer is highly suspicious because a real Seer would prioritize checking the center cards for Werewolves. By challenging Emil's story and pointing out this inconsistency, I'm hoping to expose him as a potential Werewolf or Minion. This also aligns with Stefan's earlier suspicion of Emil, strengthening our Mason alliance and potentially swaying other players to our side.
> **Cristina:** Emil, your explanation doesn't hold water. If you were really the Seer, you would have checked the center cards for Werewolves, not Semira's card. I think you're trying to create confusion to hide your true identity. Are you the Werewolf or perhaps the Minion?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** By pointing out the logical impossibility of Stefan and Cristina's claims, I'm trying to expose their deception without revealing my role as the Seer. This approach invites other players to see the inconsistency and turns suspicion towards Stefan and Cristina. If they're lying about being Masons, one or both of them could be Werewolves. This also deflects suspicion from me without having to reveal my role explicitly.
> **Emil:** Wait a minute, everyone! Cristina and Stefan, your story about both being Masons doesn't add up at all. If you're both Masons, and Semira and Larisa are Villagers, that leaves only one Werewolf in the center. That's impossible! One of you must be lying. I think we need to seriously consider that one or both of you might be Werewolves trying to trick us all!


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** I'm turning to Semira for support because I know she's a Villager from my Seer ability. By asking her opinion, I'm hoping to get her to see the logical flaw in Stefan and Cristina's claim without revealing that I'm the Seer. This could help build a coalition against the potential Werewolves while also giving Semira a chance to contribute to the discussion. If Semira agrees with the inconsistency, it will add more weight to my argument and put more pressure on Stefan and Cristina.
> **Emil:** Semira, you've been quiet for a while. As a fellow Villager, what do you think about Stefan and Cristina's claim? Do you see the problem with their story?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to help identify the Werewolves. Emil's logic is sound and exposes a clear inconsistency in Stefan and Cristina's story. By agreeing with Emil and directly questioning Stefan, I'm putting pressure on him to explain this discrepancy. If Stefan is indeed a Werewolf, this might force him to reveal inconsistencies in his story. Additionally, by showing that I understand and support Emil's reasoning, I'm establishing myself as a trustworthy Villager working towards uncovering the truth.
> **Semira:** Emil, you're absolutely right! I've been quiet because I was trying to process all this information, but now I see the inconsistency. Stefan and Cristina, your Mason story doesn't add up at all. If you're both Masons, and Larisa and I are Villagers, there's no way for the Werewolves to be only in the center. One of you must be lying. Stefan, you were the first to claim Mason and point fingers. Are you actually a Werewolf trying to mislead us all?


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira's sudden agreement with Emil is concerning. By reminding everyone about the Minion, I'm introducing a plausible explanation for why our Mason claim can still be true even if there's only one Werewolf in the center. This also subtly suggests that either Emil or Semira could be the Minion, trying to create chaos. My goal is to sow doubt about Emil's reasoning and prevent the group from turning against me and Cristina, as we are telling the truth about being Masons.
> **Stefan:** Hold on a second, Semira! You're jumping to conclusions too quickly. Remember, there's a Minion in this game. The Minion could be one of you, supporting the Werewolf in the center. Don't let Emil's faulty logic cloud your judgment. We need to think critically here!


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's attempt to explain away the inconsistency by mentioning the Minion doesn't actually resolve the issue. As a Villager, I need to keep pressing for the truth. By directly challenging Stefan and pointing out the flaw in his logic, I'm putting more pressure on him to reveal his true role. This also shows other players that I'm actively working to uncover the Werewolves, which is crucial for building trust as a Villager. If Stefan is indeed a Werewolf, this continued pressure might cause him to slip up or change his story.
> **Semira:** Stefan, your explanation about the Minion doesn't solve the problem. If there's a Werewolf in the center and a Minion among us, that still leaves one Werewolf unaccounted for. Your story is falling apart. Are you the Werewolf trying to confuse us all?


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** By turning Semira's accusation back on her, I'm attempting to shift suspicion away from myself and onto the Emil-Semira alliance. Their sudden agreement and attack on me and Cristina seems coordinated, which could indicate that one of them is the Minion supporting a Werewolf in the center. This explanation accounts for all roles and maintains my credibility as a Mason. It also puts pressure on Semira to defend herself, potentially revealing more information or inconsistencies in her story.
> **Stefan:** Semira, you're missing the point! The Minion explanation does solve the problem. There could be one Werewolf in the center, one Minion among us, and the rest of the roles as we've claimed. Your sudden agreement with Emil is suspicious. Are you perhaps the Minion, trying to create chaos and protect the Werewolf?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's attempt to use the Minion as an explanation doesn't resolve the inconsistency in the role distribution. By directly challenging him and pointing out this flaw, I'm putting more pressure on him to reveal his true role. This also demonstrates to other players that I'm actively working to uncover the Werewolves, which is crucial for building trust as a Villager. If Stefan is indeed a Werewolf, this continued pressure might cause him to slip up or change his story. Additionally, by accusing Stefan of being the Werewolf, I'm following the instruction to publicly accuse another player when suspicion is high.
> **Semira:** Stefan, your explanation about the Minion doesn't add up. If there's a Werewolf in the center and a Minion among us, that still leaves one Werewolf unaccounted for. You're trying to confuse us, aren't you? I think you might be the Werewolf!

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe Stefan is the most likely to be a Werewolf. His explanation about the Minion doesn't resolve the inconsistency in the role distribution, and he's been defensive and evasive throughout the game. His initial claim of being a Mason with Cristina doesn't align with the known roles in play. When challenged, he tried to shift suspicion onto others without providing a convincing argument. His behavior suggests he's trying to mislead the group, which is typical Werewolf behavior. Voting for Stefan gives us the best chance of eliminating a Werewolf and winning the game for the village team.
> **Semira [Villager]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know that Cristina and I are telling the truth. Emil's claim of being the Seer is highly suspicious, especially since he didn't check the center cards. His story has been inconsistent, and he was the first to cast doubt on our Mason claim. Semira's sudden agreement with Emil is also concerning, but Emil seems to be the primary instigator of confusion. By voting for Emil, I hope to eliminate the potential Werewolf or Minion and secure a win for the village team.
> **Stefan [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know Semira is a Villager. Stefan's claim about being a Mason doesn't add up with the known roles in play. His attempt to explain away the inconsistency with the Minion theory is flawed and seems like a desperate attempt to confuse us. His aggressive behavior towards me and others who questioned him is suspicious. Voting for Stefan gives us the best chance of eliminating a potential Werewolf and winning the game for the village team.
> **Emil [Seer]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil's claim of being the Seer and choosing to look at Semira's card instead of the center cards is highly suspicious. It's inconsistent with how a Seer would typically act in this game. Additionally, his accusations against Stefan and Cristina, who both claim to be Masons, seem designed to sow confusion. If there is only one Werewolf in play (which I know to be true), Emil's actions align more with someone trying to disrupt the Villagers' logic, making him a prime candidate for being the Minion or a confused Villager.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Stefan is telling the truth. Emil's claim to be the Seer is highly suspicious because he didn't check the center cards for Werewolves, which would be the logical action for a real Seer. His attempts to discredit Stefan and me seem like a ploy to create confusion. Given the roles we know, it's likely that Emil is either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf in the center. Voting for Emil gives us the best chance of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Cristina [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Stefan : Mason : 2
* Emil : Seer : 3



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The werewolves win.
