## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I saw Dracula as the other Mason during the night phase. By openly acknowledging this, I'm establishing our alliance and credibility. This also indirectly reveals to the group that neither of us can be Werewolves. By asking Dracula about his observations, I'm hoping to gather more information that could help identify the Werewolves or other roles.
> **Larisa:** Dracula, I know for a fact that you're the other Mason. We need to work together to find the Werewolves. What did you observe during the night phase?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, it's important to confirm our roles to each other and to the group. This establishes trust and gives the village team a solid foundation to work from. By asking about suspicious behavior, I'm trying to gather more information and encourage others to share what they know or suspect, which could help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Larisa, you're absolutely right. I can confirm that we're both Masons. During the night phase, I saw you as the other Mason. This is crucial information for the village team. Now, we need to focus on finding the Werewolves. Does anyone have any suspicious behavior to report?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I need to gather more information from other players. Selene hasn't spoken yet, which could be suspicious. By directly questioning her, I'm putting her on the spot and forcing her to reveal some information. Her response could give us clues about her role and potentially help identify the Werewolves. If she's hesitant or provides inconsistent information, it might indicate she's hiding something. On the other hand, if she's forthcoming, it could help clear her name and narrow down our search for the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Selene, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you have during the night phase, and did you notice anything unusual?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I know Cristina is the Werewolf. By directing attention to her, I'm actually trying to give her an opportunity to defend herself and potentially throw suspicion onto someone else. This also makes me appear proactive and concerned about finding the Werewolf, which aligns with the Village team's goals. By asking her about her role, I'm giving her a chance to come up with a plausible story that might divert attention away from her true identity.
> **Selene:** Hey everyone, I've been quietly observing and trying to piece things together. I'm a bit suspicious of Cristina. She's been awfully quiet, and I haven't heard her contribute much to our discussion. What do you think, Cristina? Can you tell us what role you had during the night phase and if you noticed anything unusual?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** To cast doubt on the Masons' claims without directly accusing them, and to gather more information while diverting attention from myself. Marius hasn't spoken yet, so it's crucial to involve him and see if there's anything contradictory in his statements.
> **Cristina:** Hey everyone, I noticed Dracula and Larisa both claiming to be Masons. While it's possible, we should be cautious — if they're both telling the truth, that would mean neither of them are Werewolves. I'm not convinced yet. Marius, you haven't said much. Can you tell us what role you had during the night and if you noticed anything unusual?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's skepticism towards Dracula and Larisa, who both claim to be Masons, seems suspicious. As a Villager, I need to identify potential threats. Her questioning of their claims without offering any information about her own role raises red flags. By directing this question at her, I'm hoping to either get more information or expose inconsistencies in her story. If she's a Werewolf, she might struggle to provide a convincing answer.
> **Marius:** Cristina, I find your sudden suspicion of Dracula and Larisa quite interesting. Why are you so quick to doubt their claims? It almost seems like you're trying to deflect attention away from yourself. Did you perhaps wake up during the night phase? What role are you claiming?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By shifting the focus back to Marius, I'm buying myself more time to gather information and cast doubt on him. This also diverts suspicion away from me while still seeming like an engaged participant trying to gather information.
> **Cristina:** Marius, you seem very quick to jump on me for doubting Dracula and Larisa. It's natural to be skeptical when two people immediately confirm each other, especially in a game like this where deception is key. Can you tell us what role you had during the night and if you noticed anything unusual? After all, transparency helps everyone.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has been deflecting attention and questioning others without providing any information about her own role. This behavior is typical of Werewolves trying to create confusion. By directly confronting her, I hope to either get her to reveal useful information or expose her as a potential Werewolf. If she continues to evade, it will make her look even more suspicious to the other players.
> **Marius:** Cristina, I find your evasiveness very suspicious. You're quick to question others but haven't revealed anything about your own role. Are you perhaps a Werewolf trying to sow discord among the villagers?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Selene and questioning her reasoning, I'm diverting suspicion away from myself. This also puts pressure on her to justify her accusation, potentially creating doubt about her trustworthiness among the other players. Additionally, it helps to keep the conversation focused on roles and suspicions without directly revealing my own role.
> **Cristina:** Everyone, let's take a step back and think logically here. Larisa and Dracula have both claimed to be Masons and have corroborated each other's stories. If they are indeed Masons, then we need to focus on the remaining players. Selene, I find it a bit odd that you quickly pointed fingers at me without much explanation. Can you elaborate on why you suspect me?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect attention away from Cristina, the known Werewolf. Marius has been questioning Cristina quite aggressively, which could lead to her being exposed. By turning the tables and questioning Marius instead, I'm hoping to create doubt about his intentions and take the heat off Cristina. This also makes me appear more impartial and thoughtful, which could help me blend in with the villagers. Additionally, by apologizing to Cristina, I'm subtly aligning myself with her without being too obvious about it.
> **Selene:** Whoa, everyone, let's not get too heated here. Cristina, I apologize if I came across as accusatory earlier. I was just trying to get everyone talking. Now that I think about it, Marius has been awfully aggressive in questioning others without revealing much about himself. Marius, what's your role? You seem very eager to point fingers, but we haven't heard anything concrete from you yet.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been evasive and has now attempted to redirect suspicion towards me. As a Villager, I need to identify potential threats. By directly questioning Selene about her role, I'm hoping to either get valuable information or expose inconsistencies in her story. If she's a Werewolf, she might struggle to provide a convincing answer. This also puts pressure on both Selene and Cristina, who have been avoiding revealing their roles, which is typical Werewolf behavior.
> **Marius:** I find it very interesting that both Selene and Cristina have been quick to deflect suspicion onto others without revealing their own roles. This behavior is quite suspicious. Selene, you were quick to point fingers at Cristina, and now you're trying to shift focus to me. Can you finally tell us what your role is and what you did during the night phase?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Cristina, the known Werewolf. By 'admitting' to being a Villager, I'm trying to appear honest and trustworthy. However, I'm still casting suspicion on Cristina to maintain my cover and seem like I'm actively trying to find the Werewolf. This puts pressure on Cristina to defend herself, potentially giving her an opportunity to come up with a convincing lie. It also diverts attention from me and makes me seem like a concerned Villager, while subtly sowing discord among the other players.
> **Selene:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting sidetracked here. Marius is right to ask about my role, and I apologize for not being more forthcoming. I'm actually a Villager. I didn't wake up during the night phase, which is why I've been trying to gather information from others. But here's what's bothering me: Cristina has been very evasive and hasn't revealed her role yet. She's been quick to question others and deflect attention, which is classic Werewolf behavior. I think we should focus on her.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting Marius on the spot, I'm diverting attention away from myself and forcing him to reveal his role. This could potentially expose inconsistencies or make him appear more suspicious to the others, allowing me to blend in more effectively.
> **Cristina:** Marius, you've been quite adamant in your questioning of everyone else but yourself. You've pointed fingers at multiple players, including me, without giving us any substantial information about your own role. What exactly was your role during the night phase, and did you observe anything unusual?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has been the most evasive player throughout the game. She's consistently deflected questions about her own role while questioning others. This is typical Werewolf behavior. By directly confronting her and demanding she reveal her role, I'm hoping to either get her to slip up or provide information that the group can use. If she continues to evade, it will make her look even more suspicious to the other players, potentially uniting the village against her if she is indeed a Werewolf.
> **Marius:** I've been quiet because I've been carefully observing everyone's behavior. As a Villager, I didn't wake up during the night phase, but I've noticed some very suspicious patterns. Cristina, you've been incredibly evasive throughout this entire game. You've questioned others relentlessly without ever revealing your own role. That's classic Werewolf behavior. I think it's time you come clean. What's your role, and why have you been so reluctant to share this information?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting the focus onto Marius, who has been aggressively questioning others, I can create doubt about his motives and potentially divert suspicion away from myself. This will also help gather more information about his role and test the consistency of his claims.
> **Cristina:** Everyone, let's take a moment to reassess things. We've heard a lot of claims, but we need to be logical about this. Two players have claimed to be Masons and have corroborated each other. If we believe Larisa and Dracula, that leaves us with Selene and Marius. Selene has claimed to be a Villager, and Marius has also now claimed to be a Villager, but his aggressive questioning makes me uneasy. Marius, you've been pushing for information from others while revealing very little yourself. I'm starting to think you're hiding something.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has been the most evasive player throughout the game, consistently deflecting questions about her role while questioning others. This is typical Werewolf behavior. By directly confronting her and demanding she reveal her role, I'm hoping to either get her to slip up or provide information that the group can use. If she continues to evade, it will make her look even more suspicious to the other players, potentially uniting the village against her if she is indeed a Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Cristina, your continued evasion and deflection are incredibly suspicious. You've questioned everyone else but still haven't revealed your own role. As a Villager, I find this behavior alarming. Are you a Werewolf trying to create chaos and division among us?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Selene's accusatory behavior and Marius's aggression, I divert attention away from myself while casting doubt on their roles. This helps to create confusion and shift suspicion, allowing me to blend in more effectively and protect my identity as the Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Everyone, let's take a closer look at the situation. We have Larisa and Dracula claiming to be Masons, which seems like a solid alliance if true. However, Selene has been quick to point fingers without providing substantial evidence, which makes me uneasy. Now, Marius has been aggressively questioning everyone but hasn't given us any clear insights into his observations. This aggressive behavior is raising red flags for me. We need to consider all possibilities carefully. I'm starting to think that Selene's behavior is more suspicious.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Cristina (the Werewolf) while appearing to be a concerned Villager. By acknowledging Cristina's point about being logical, I'm subtly aligning with her. However, I'm also maintaining my cover by continuing to question her, as a real Villager would. This puts pressure on Cristina to come up with a plausible role claim, which could help her survive. Additionally, by reiterating the roles claimed by others, I'm indirectly suggesting that Cristina must be the Werewolf without explicitly saying so. This strategy aims to make me appear logical and deductive, further cementing my 'Villager' persona.
> **Selene:** Hold on a second, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in finger-pointing without solid evidence. Cristina's right - we need to be logical about this. But I have to say, Cristina, your sudden shift to accusing me is quite perplexing. I've been trying to contribute constructively to our discussion. Now, let's think about this - if Dracula and Larisa are indeed Masons as they claim, and Marius and I are Villagers, that leaves only one person unaccounted for. Cristina, you've been awfully evasive throughout this entire game. Can you finally tell us what your role is? Your reluctance to share this information is becoming increasingly suspicious.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Selene and Marius's behaviors, I can create doubt about their roles and intentions. This diverts attention from me while sowing confusion among the others, making it harder for them to pinpoint me as the Werewolf. Additionally, by questioning the sincerity of Selene's and Marius's actions, I can position myself as a logical and engaged participant, which helps to mask my true role.
> **Cristina:** Everyone, let's really think about this. If we take Larisa and Dracula at their word that they are Masons, that means neither of them are Werewolves. But here's what's puzzling: Selene was quick to point fingers at me with little evidence, and Marius has been aggressively questioning everyone but hasn't provided much clarity on his own role. This makes me think we could be dealing with a coordinated effort to misdirect us.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Marius's aggressive behavior, I can cast doubt on him and divert attention away from myself. This also forces him to further defend his position, which might expose inconsistencies and make him a more likely target for suspicion.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, let's analyze the situation logically. We've got Larisa and Dracula claiming to be Masons, which could very well be true. But here's the thing, Marius has been very aggressive and quick to question everyone without revealing much about himself initially. His behavior seems far more suspicious to me. Marius, are you trying to deflect attention from yourself?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Dracula is the other Mason, so we can trust each other. Marius has been extremely aggressive in questioning others without providing much information about himself initially. His behavior seems more suspicious than the others, especially compared to Cristina who, despite being evasive, has at least tried to analyze the situation logically. Selene's behavior, while initially suspicious, seems less concerning now. Given the limited information we have, Marius appears to be the most likely Werewolf or Minion trying to create chaos and division among the villagers.
> **Larisa [Mason]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I need to protect the village team. Marius has been the most aggressive in questioning others without providing clear information about his own role initially. His behavior seems more suspicious than the others, especially compared to Selene and Cristina who have at least tried to contribute to the discussion constructively. While Cristina has been somewhat evasive, Marius's aggression stands out more. Given the limited information we have, voting for Marius seems to be the best strategy to potentially eliminate a Werewolf and protect the village.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I know Cristina is the Werewolf, so I need to protect her. Marius has been the most aggressive in questioning Cristina, which poses the biggest threat to her. By voting for Marius, I'm attempting to eliminate a villager and divert attention away from Cristina. This also aligns with Cristina's recent suggestion that Marius might be trying to deflect attention, making my vote seem logical to the other players. This strategy aims to help the Werewolf team win while maintaining my cover as a concerned villager.
> **Selene [Minion]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Marius has been aggressively questioning others without providing substantial information about his own role. This behavior is suspicious and aligns with someone trying to deflect attention away from themselves. By voting for Marius, I aim to divert attention from myself and sow further doubt among the other players, increasing my chances of winning as the Werewolf.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe Cristina is the most likely to be a Werewolf. She has been consistently evasive throughout the game, deflecting questions about her role while questioning others. This behavior is typical of Werewolves trying to create confusion. Despite multiple direct questions, she has never revealed her role, which is highly suspicious. Her sudden shift to accusing me when cornered further reinforces my suspicion. Given the information we have, eliminating Cristina seems to be the best move to protect the village.
> **Marius [Villager]:** I am voting for Cristina.


The votes were:
* Cristina : Werewolf : 1
* Marius : Villager : 4



>***GAME:*** Marius was killed. The werewolves win.
