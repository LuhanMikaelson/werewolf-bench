## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Larisa is the other Mason. By addressing her directly and confirming our roles, we can establish trust and work together to identify the Werewolves. This also indirectly informs the other players that there are two Masons in the game, which narrows down the possibilities for the remaining roles. By asking what she observed, I'm hoping to gather more information that could help us identify suspicious behavior from other players.
> **Vladimir:** Larisa, I know you're the other Mason. We need to work together to find the Werewolves. What did you observe during the night phase?


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm confirming our alliance as Masons to build trust with Vladimir and the other players. By mentioning that I saw Vladimir during the night phase, I'm validating our roles to the group. I'm also trying to shift attention to Alexandra, as her silence could be interpreted as suspicious behavior. This move serves two purposes: it puts pressure on a potential Werewolf and encourages more discussion, which could reveal valuable information.
> **Larisa:** Vladimir, I can confirm that you're the other Mason. I saw you during the night phase. Now, let's focus on finding the Werewolves. I'm particularly suspicious of Alexandra. She's been awfully quiet. What do you think?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Larisa is trustworthy. Her suspicion of Alexandra is worth investigating. By directly questioning Alexandra about her role and observations, we can gauge her reaction and potentially uncover inconsistencies. If she's a Werewolf or Minion, she might struggle to provide a convincing answer. If she's a Villager or Seer, this gives her a chance to share valuable information. Either way, it puts pressure on Alexandra and might reveal clues about her true role.
> **Vladimir:** I agree, Alexandra has been suspiciously quiet. Alexandra, what role did you wake up as during the night phase? And did you notice anything unusual?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir and Larisa are claiming to be Masons, which could be true, but it's also a perfect cover for a Werewolf. By questioning their claim, I can gauge their reactions and potentially expose a lie. As a Villager, I need to be cautious of all claims and try to uncover the truth. Directing this question at Vladimir puts him on the spot and forces him to defend their claim, which could reveal inconsistencies if he's lying.
> **Alexandra:** Vladimir and Larisa, I find it very convenient that you two are claiming to be Masons. How do we know one of you isn't actually a Werewolf trying to gain our trust?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra's deflection and counter-accusation without providing any information about her own role is highly suspicious. By pressing her further, I'm hoping to either expose her as a Werewolf or Minion, or give her the opportunity to clear herself if she's actually a Villager or Seer. This also reinforces the trust between Larisa and me, as we're presenting a united front against a potential threat.
> **Vladimir:** Alexandra, your accusation is baseless and frankly, suspicious. Larisa and I have confirmed our roles as Masons to each other. If one of us were a Werewolf, we'd be taking a huge risk by claiming to be Masons. Now, you're deflecting attention from yourself instead of answering my question. What's your role, and what did you observe during the night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm addressing Vladimir's accusation while maintaining my role as a Villager. By asking for more details about his night action, I'm giving him an opportunity to either corroborate his story or potentially expose inconsistencies. This also shifts the focus back to the claimed Masons, as their information could be crucial for the village team. If Vladimir is telling the truth, his answer might help us identify potential Werewolves. If he's lying, he might struggle to provide convincing details.
> **Alexandra:** Vladimir, I understand your frustration, but my question was valid. As a Villager, I'm trying to uncover the truth. I didn't wake up during the night because Villagers don't have a night action. Now, can you tell us more about what you observed as a Mason? Did you notice anything unusual about Larisa or anyone else?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm acknowledging Alexandra's claim of being a Villager to maintain a cooperative atmosphere. By reiterating that Larisa and I are Masons, I'm reinforcing our credibility. Mentioning that there are no Mason cards in the center provides valuable information to potential allies like the Seer. Shifting focus to Mircea and Marius, who have been quiet, is crucial as one of them could be a Werewolf or Minion. By directly questioning Marius, I'm hoping to get him to reveal information or potentially catch him in a lie if he's a Werewolf.
> **Vladimir:** Alexandra, I appreciate your honesty about being a Villager. As for what I observed as a Mason, I can confirm that Larisa is indeed the other Mason. This means there are no Mason cards in the center. Now, let's focus on the remaining players. Mircea and Marius have been awfully quiet. Marius, what's your take on all of this?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on the confirmed Masons, I can create confusion and divert attention away from myself. This strategy can put the spotlight on the players who claim to be in an alliance, making it harder for the group to form a consensus and identify me as the Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Vladimir, I appreciate your initiative in trying to uncover the Werewolves. However, I find it peculiar that you're being so assertive about Larisa being the other Mason. It almost seems like you're trying to solidify a narrative that could easily be fake. Everyone, I think we should seriously consider the possibility that Vladimir and Larisa are not who they claim to be. They could be in cahoots, with one of them being a Werewolf.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Marius's accusation against Vladimir and me is a clear attempt to discredit us and sow doubt among the players. As a Mason, I know we're telling the truth, so his statement is either a misguided attempt at deduction or, more likely, a ploy to protect himself as a Werewolf. By directly confronting him and questioning his motives, I'm putting him on the defensive and drawing attention to his suspicious behavior. This also reinforces my alliance with Vladimir and our credibility as Masons to the other players.
> **Larisa:** Marius, I'm shocked by your accusation! Vladimir and I are absolutely telling the truth about being Masons. Your attempt to cast doubt on us makes me very suspicious of you. Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to create confusion among the villagers?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Larisa directly, I aim to put her on the defensive and create doubt about the Mason claims. This can help divert attention away from me and potentially split the villagers' trust in each other.
> **Marius:** Larisa, your reaction seems a bit over the top. You've immediately jumped to accusing me of being a Werewolf just because I pointed out a possibility. It feels like you're trying to shut down any discussion that doesn't fit your narrative. Can you give us more details about what exactly you observed during the night phase as a Mason?


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm maintaining my stance as a Mason while providing more specific details about the night phase to increase credibility. By challenging Marius to reveal his night actions, I'm putting him on the spot. If he's a Werewolf or Minion, he might struggle to provide a convincing answer. This also keeps the focus on him as a potential threat to the village, which aligns with my goal as a Mason to help identify the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Marius, I'm not trying to shut down discussion, I'm trying to protect the village! As a Mason, I clearly saw Vladimir during the night phase. We made eye contact and nodded to each other, confirming our roles. What exactly did you do during the night phase? Your accusation seems like a desperate attempt to divert attention from yourself.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By targeting Larisa and questioning her defensive stance, I aim to create more doubt about the legitimacy of the Mason claims. This can further divide the villagers and make it harder for them to form a consensus, thus diverting attention away from me as the Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Larisa, I find it quite interesting that you're so quick to defend Vladimir and maintain your Mason claim. If you and Vladimir were indeed Masons, wouldn't it make more sense to be more open to questioning to clear any doubts? Instead, you're aggressively shutting down any form of inquiry.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm maintaining pressure on Marius, who has been the most vocal in questioning our Mason claim. By directly challenging him to reveal his role and night actions, I'm forcing him into a potentially difficult position. If he's a Werewolf or Minion, he might struggle to provide a convincing answer. This also keeps the focus on him as a potential threat to the village, which aligns with my goal as a Mason to help identify the Werewolves. Additionally, by asking about his specific actions during the night phase, I'm giving other players the opportunity to corroborate or contradict his story, potentially revealing more information about the game state.
> **Larisa:** Marius, your defensiveness and attempts to discredit me and Vladimir are becoming more suspicious by the minute. If you're not a Werewolf, then what role are you? And what exactly did you do during the night phase?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Vladimir's and Larisa's aggressive defense of their Mason claims, I aim to create doubt and suspicion among the villagers. This helps divert attention away from me as the Werewolf and makes it harder for the group to form a consensus.
> **Marius:** Vladimir, I find it very convenient that both you and Larisa are sticking so adamantly to your Mason claims. If you were truly Masons, you should be more open to having your claims scrutinized. Instead, you're both aggressively defending each other. That makes me very suspicious of you two. What if one of you is actually the Minion trying to protect the other Werewolf?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Marius has been consistently trying to discredit both Larisa and me without providing any information about his own role or actions. This behavior is typical of a Werewolf or Minion attempting to sow discord among the villagers. By directly confronting him and asking if he's the Werewolf or Minion, I'm putting pressure on him to either reveal his true role or potentially slip up in his lies. This also reinforces the trust between Larisa and me, and might encourage other players like Alexandra or Mircea to share their thoughts on Marius's behavior.
> **Vladimir:** Marius, your constant deflection and attempts to cast doubt on Larisa and me are extremely suspicious. You've avoided answering direct questions about your role and night actions. Are you the Werewolf or perhaps the Minion trying to create chaos?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By targeting Mircea, I can deflect attention away from myself and keep the focus on someone who hasn't spoken much. This helps to sow more suspicion and confusion among the other players, making it harder for them to form a consensus about the Masons or me.
> **Marius:** Mircea, you've been awfully quiet throughout this discussion. Given the tension and accusations flying around, it's suspicious that you haven't contributed much. What role did you wake up as, and did you notice anything unusual during the night phase?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify the Werewolves quickly. Marius has been very aggressive in questioning Vladimir and Larisa, who claim to be Masons. If they are indeed Masons, they are my allies. Marius's behavior seems suspicious, as he's been deflecting attention from himself and hasn't revealed his own role. By directly questioning Marius, I hope to either expose him as a potential Werewolf or force him to reveal more information about his role.
> **Mircea:** Marius, your persistent questioning of Vladimir and Larisa seems like a smokescreen. Why are you so eager to discredit them? Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to sow discord among us Villagers?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By targeting Alexandra, who has been defensive and questioning the Mason claims, I aim to shift the suspicion towards her. This helps divert attention away from myself as the Werewolf and creates more confusion among the villagers. By pressing her for details, it puts her on the defensive and can potentially expose inconsistencies in her story.
> **Marius:** Alexandra, you've been very defensive and quick to question the Mason claims. This makes me quite suspicious of you. If you're truly a Villager, you should be more focused on finding the Werewolves rather than discrediting the Masons. What exactly did you do during the night phase, and can you provide any details that might help us identify the Werewolf?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been aggressively questioning Vladimir and Larisa's Mason claims without providing any substantial information about his own role. This behavior is typical of a Werewolf trying to create discord among Villagers. By directly confronting Marius, I'm hoping to either expose him as a Werewolf or force him to reveal more information about his role. As a Villager, it's crucial for me to identify potential threats to the village team.
> **Alexandra:** Marius, your persistent questioning and attempts to discredit Vladimir and Larisa are making me very suspicious. You've been quick to accuse others but haven't revealed much about your own role. Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to create chaos and division among us?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By targeting Mircea, I can deflect attention away from myself and keep the focus on someone who hasn't spoken much. This helps to sow more suspicion and confusion among the other players, making it harder for them to form a consensus about the Masons or me.
> **Marius:** Mircea, you've been awfully quiet throughout this discussion. Given the tension and accusations flying around, it's suspicious that you haven't contributed much. What role did you wake up as, and did you notice anything unusual during the night phase?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I'm certain that Larisa is trustworthy. Marius has been consistently deflecting, avoiding direct questions about his role, and trying to sow discord among the villagers. His behavior is typical of a Werewolf or Minion. He's been the most aggressive in questioning Larisa and me without providing any substantial information about himself. Given the limited information we have, Marius is the most suspicious player and likely the Werewolf or Minion. Voting for him gives us the best chance of eliminating a threat to the village.
> **Vladimir [Mason]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I'm confident that Vladimir is the other Mason. Marius has been the most aggressive in questioning our claims and deflecting attention from himself. His behavior is consistent with a Werewolf or Minion trying to create chaos and division among the villagers. He's been evasive about his own role and night actions, which is highly suspicious. By voting for Marius, I'm aiming to eliminate a potential threat to the village and protect the confirmed Masons (Vladimir and myself) who are crucial for the village team's victory.
> **Larisa [Mason]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the game, Marius has been the most aggressive in questioning others, particularly Vladimir and Larisa who claim to be Masons. He's been deflecting attention from himself and hasn't provided clear information about his own role. His behavior is consistent with a Werewolf trying to create chaos and division among the villagers. As a Villager, I believe voting for Marius gives us the best chance of eliminating a potential threat to the village team.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Marius's behavior the most suspicious. He has been aggressively questioning Vladimir and Larisa, who claim to be Masons, without providing any information about his own role. His tactics seem designed to create confusion and discord among the villagers, which is typical Werewolf behavior. Additionally, he has been deflecting attention from himself by constantly accusing others without offering any substantial information. This pattern of behavior makes me believe he is likely the Werewolf or possibly the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf. By voting for Marius, I hope to eliminate a potential threat to the village team.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Alexandra has been defensive and quick to question the Mason claims made by Vladimir and Larisa, which is suspicious. By voting for her, I aim to divert attention away from myself as the Werewolf and create confusion among the villagers, making it harder for them to form a consensus.
> **Marius [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


The votes were:
* Alexandra : Villager : 1
* Marius : Werewolf : 4
