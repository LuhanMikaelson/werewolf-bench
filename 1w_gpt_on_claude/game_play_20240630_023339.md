## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Michael. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Dragos is a minion and is aware that Michael is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Andrei and Semira. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Alexandra. They are thinking about their action.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I think it's more valuable to confirm another player's role rather than looking at two center cards. By checking a player's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or confirm an ally. I've chosen Michael because he's the first player mentioned, and starting with him gives me a baseline to work from. If he turns out to be a Villager or a helpful role, I can use that information to build trust. If he's a Werewolf, I'll have crucial information to share during the day phase. This strategy allows me to gather concrete information about the game state rather than dealing with the uncertainty of two unknown center cards.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I want to cast suspicion on someone else to deflect attention away from myself. By targeting Andrei, I can make others start questioning him instead of focusing on me. Plus, getting Andrei to reveal his role might provide more information for me to manipulate.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, I think it's time we start getting to the bottom of this. I'll start by saying that I woke up as a Villager. Nothing fancy, just a regular Villager. But here's the thing, I've got my eyes on Andrei. Something about the way he's been acting makes me suspicious. Andrei, care to share what your role is?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Semira is the other Mason. Michael's accusation against me seems unfounded and potentially a diversion tactic. By revealing my role and Semira's, I'm providing valuable information to the village team while also putting pressure on Michael to explain his suspicion. This could help us identify if Michael is actually a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead the group.
> **Andrei:** Hold on a second, Michael. Why are you so quick to point fingers at me? I find that pretty suspicious. As a matter of fact, I'm a Mason, and I can tell you with certainty that Semira is the other Mason. So, Michael, if you're really a Villager, why are you trying to cast doubt on me instead of helping us find the real threats?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking both Dragos and Alexandra about their roles, I can gather more information and potentially find inconsistencies in their stories. This will help me identify possible Seers or Villagers, which could be crucial for my plan as a Werewolf. Additionally, it diverts the attention from me and places the spotlight on them.
> **Michael:** Alright, Andrei, you've got my attention. If you and Semira are Masons, then that does make sense. But I still feel like we need to be cautious. Dragos and Alexandra, what roles do you claim to have? We've got to get as much information out there as possible to make a good decision.


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect attention away from Michael, the known Werewolf. By questioning Alexandra, who hasn't spoken yet, I'm creating doubt and shifting focus. I'm also reinforcing my 'Villager' claim to appear innocent. This move allows me to gather more information while protecting Michael and maintaining my cover.
> **Dragos:** Whoa, hold on a second! Michael, you're accusing Andrei, but Andrei and Semira claim to be Masons? That's quite a revelation! As for me, I'm just a simple Villager, trying to make sense of all this. But something doesn't add up here. Alexandra, you've been awfully quiet. What's your role in all of this? I think we need to hear from everyone before jumping to conclusions.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have concrete information about Michael's role. It's crucial to reveal this information early to help the village team identify the threat. By directly confronting Michael, I'm hoping to put pressure on him and see how he reacts. This also establishes my credibility as the Seer and allows other players to trust my information. It's a risky move as it makes me a target for the Werewolf team, but it's necessary to protect the village.
> **Alexandra:** Michael, I'm sorry, but you're lying. I'm the Seer, and I saw your card during the night. You're a Werewolf!


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Alexandra's timing and asking Dragos to explain it, I can cast doubt on her accusation and potentially create confusion among the players. This also helps shift some of the spotlight off of me.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, let's slow down a bit and think this through. Alexandra is claiming to be the Seer and saying I'm a Werewolf. But if that's true, why didn't she reveal this information right away? It feels like a last-minute attempt to divert attention. Besides, Andrei and Semira claiming to be Masons seems a bit convenient, doesn't it? Dragos, you've been quiet, and I want to know a bit more. If you're really a Villager, can you tell us why you think Alexandra waited until now to accuse me? This seems fishy.


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect Michael (the Werewolf) and create doubt about Alexandra's claim. By questioning Alexandra's timing and expressing skepticism about the Mason claims, I'm sowing seeds of doubt without directly accusing anyone. This helps maintain my cover as a Villager while potentially steering the group away from Michael. I'm also subtly hinting at the possibility of other roles being in the center, which could make people doubt Alexandra's Seer claim.
> **Dragos:** Hold on a second, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in accusations without really thinking this through. Alexandra, your claim about being the Seer and Michael being a Werewolf is quite serious. But if that's true, why didn't you speak up earlier? It seems awfully convenient to drop such a bombshell now. And Andrei, Semira, you two being Masons is interesting, but how can we be sure? I'm just a Villager trying to make sense of all this, but something doesn't feel right. We need to be careful about who we trust here.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Dragos' concerns directly, I'm attempting to solidify my position as the Seer and redirect attention back to Michael, the confirmed Werewolf. This also puts some pressure on Dragos, who seems to be deflecting attention away from Michael. It's possible Dragos could be the Minion, trying to protect Michael. By questioning his motives, I'm hoping to reveal more about his true intentions and allegiances.
> **Alexandra:** Dragos, I understand your skepticism, but as the Seer, I had to carefully consider when to reveal this information. Accusing someone of being a Werewolf is a big deal, and I wanted to hear what everyone had to say first. Now, I have a question for you: Why are you so quick to doubt my claim instead of focusing on the fact that we've identified a Werewolf?


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Michael (the Werewolf) and discredit Alexandra's Seer claim. By pointing out the logical inconsistency between the Mason claims and Alexandra's Seer claim, I'm creating doubt about her accusation. This also reinforces my 'Villager' persona by appearing to think critically about the information we have. By directing the question to Alexandra, I'm putting her on the spot and potentially exposing a flaw in her story, which could lead others to doubt her and, by extension, her accusation against Michael
> **Dragos:** Hold on, everyone. I think we're getting too caught up in Alexandra's claim. Let's take a step back and consider something else. Andrei and Semira, you both claim to be Masons, right? But if that's true, then we know for certain that the Seer card is in the center. Alexandra, how do you explain that? It seems to me that someone here isn't telling the whole truth, and I don't think it's Michael.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Dragos is attempting to use faulty logic to discredit my claim as the Seer. By pointing out the flaw in his reasoning (forgetting about the Minion card), I'm reinforcing my credibility and putting pressure on him. His defense of Michael, despite my revelation, is suspicious and could indicate that he's the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf. By directly questioning his motives, I'm hoping to expose this potential alliance and make other players wary of trusting him.
> **Alexandra:** Dragos, your logic doesn't add up. The Seer card doesn't have to be in the center just because there are two Masons. There's a Minion card in play, remember? So, why are you so eager to discredit me and defend Michael?


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to continue deflecting suspicion from Michael while maintaining my cover as a Villager. By questioning Alexandra's logic and pointing out the possibility of a Minion (which I know is true), I'm sowing more doubt about her claim. Directing a question to Semira, who hasn't spoken much, serves two purposes: it takes the focus off me and Michael, and it might reveal more information that I can use to protect the Werewolf team. This approach allows me to appear as a critical thinker while secretly working against the Village team.
> **Dragos:** Wait a minute, Alexandra. You're accusing me of defending Michael, but I'm just trying to make sense of all this information. If you're really the Seer, how do you explain the discrepancy with the Mason claims? And why are you so fixated on Michael? For all we know, there could be a Minion trying to mislead us. Semira, you've been awfully quiet. What's your take on all of this?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to confirm my role as a Mason and support Andrei's claim. At the same time, I'm questioning Alexandra's timing and Dragos' defense of Michael. By directing this at Dragos, I'm putting pressure on him to explain his behavior, which seems suspicious given the information we have.
> **Semira:** Hold on a second! As a Mason, I can confirm that Andrei is telling the truth about us being Masons. But something doesn't add up here. Alexandra, if you're really the Seer, why didn't you mention seeing Michael as a Werewolf earlier? And Dragos, your sudden defense of Michael is suspicious. Are you perhaps the Minion trying to protect your Werewolf ally?


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Michael (the Werewolf). By turning Semira's accusation back on her, I'm creating doubt about her Mason claim and potentially shifting suspicion onto her. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me, potentially discredits the Mason claims (which could help Michael), and keeps the group confused. By suggesting Semira might be the Werewolf, I'm also indirectly supporting Alexandra's claim about seeing a Werewolf, which makes me appear more credible as a 'Villager' trying to solve the mystery.
> **Dragos:** Hold on, everyone! Semira's accusation against me is completely unfounded. I've been trying to piece things together just like everyone else. But now that you mention it, Semira, your sudden leap to accuse me of being the Minion is very suspicious. Why are you so quick to point fingers? Could it be that you're trying to divert attention from yourself? Maybe you're not really a Mason at all. What if you're the Werewolf, and you're using this Mason claim as a cover?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to defend my position as a Mason while also maintaining pressure on Dragos. His behavior has been consistently suspicious, defending Michael and now trying to discredit me. By turning his accusation back on him, I'm forcing him to explain his actions, which might reveal more information or inconsistencies. This also keeps the focus on potential Werewolf team members rather than letting suspicion fall on the confirmed Masons.
> **Semira:** Dragos, your accusation is ridiculous! I've been nothing but honest about being a Mason. Why would I claim such a specific role if I were the Werewolf? That would be incredibly risky. No, I think you're desperately trying to cast doubt on me because you're the one with something to hide. Are you the Minion, or perhaps the Werewolf yourself?


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Michael (the Werewolf) while maintaining my cover. By directing attention back to Michael and asking him to defend himself, I'm giving him an opportunity to clear his name. At the same time, I'm subtly casting doubt on Alexandra's accusation. This move serves multiple purposes: it keeps the focus off me, potentially discredits Alexandra's Seer claim, and allows Michael to present his defense. By appearing to seek the truth, I reinforce my 'Villager' persona while secretly working to protect the Werewolf team.
> **Dragos:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting sidetracked here. Semira's accusation against me is completely baseless, and I'm starting to wonder why she's so eager to point fingers. Michael, you've been awfully quiet since Alexandra accused you. What do you have to say for yourself? Are you really a Werewolf, or is Alexandra trying to mislead us all?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Dragos and pointing out his inconsistent behavior, I can deflect some of the suspicion away from myself. Additionally, this forces Dragos to explain his actions, which might reveal inconsistencies or provide more information I can use to further my goals as the Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, let's step back and assess the situation. We've got Andrei and Semira claiming to be Masons, and Alexandra claiming to be the Seer who saw me as a Werewolf. But here's the thing: if Alexandra is really the Seer, why did she wait so long to reveal this critical information? It seems like a last-ditch effort to shift the blame. Now, I think we should focus on Dragos. He's been flip-flopping and trying to cast doubt on multiple people. Dragos, what exactly are you trying to achieve here? Are you really just a Villager, or is there something more sinister at play?


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Michael (the Werewolf) while maintaining my cover. By appearing to defend myself vigorously against Michael's accusation and then turning it back on him, I'm creating a smokescreen. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me look innocent by passionately defending myself, it keeps the group's focus on Michael (which, counterintuitively, can help him by making the accusation seem too obvious), and it subtly supports Alexandra's claim (which I know is true) without fully committing to it. This approach allows me to appear as a confused Villager while secretly working to create enough doubt and chaos to protect the Werewolf team.
> **Dragos:** Whoa, hold on a second, Michael! You're trying to turn this around on me? That's rich coming from someone who's been accused of being a Werewolf! I've been trying to make sense of all this information and figure out who's telling the truth. If anyone's been flip-flopping, it's you! First, you accuse Andrei, then you back off when the Mason claims come out. Now you're pointing at me? Seems like classic Werewolf behavior to me, trying to create chaos and confusion. I think we need to seriously consider that Alexandra might be telling the truth about you.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By accusing Dragos, I can redirect suspicion away from myself and create more chaos among the players. Dragos has been acting inconsistently, which makes this accusation plausible and might lead others to vote for him instead of me. It's essential to keep the spotlight off of me to win as the Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, listen up! I really think we need to focus on what makes sense here. Dragos, you've been back and forth, and you're trying to cast doubt on everyone. You're defending yourself too aggressively, and that's setting off alarm bells for me. I think it's time we seriously consider that Dragos might be the Minion or even the Werewolf himself. What do you all think?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Semira is telling the truth. By reaffirming our Mason status, I'm providing a solid foundation for the village team. Focusing on Michael and Dragos as potential Werewolf/Minion pair makes sense given the information we have. By asking Alexandra for more details, I'm giving her a chance to provide more information that could help us identify the Werewolf, while also subtly testing the validity of her Seer claim.
> **Andrei:** Hold on a second! Michael, you're accusing Dragos now, but let's not forget that Alexandra claimed to see you as a Werewolf. And Dragos, your constant shifting of suspicion is indeed suspicious. I think we need to focus on the fact that Semira and I are confirmed Masons. This means that either Michael or Dragos is likely the Werewolf, with the other possibly being the Minion. Alexandra, can you tell us more about what you saw as the Seer?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** I'm reiterating my role as the Seer and the information I've gathered to reinforce my credibility. By pointing out how Andrei and Semira's claims support my information, I'm building a stronger case against Michael. At the same time, I'm addressing Dragos' suspicious behavior and questioning his motives. This puts pressure on both Michael and Dragos, potentially exposing the Werewolf-Minion duo if that's indeed the case.
> **Alexandra:** Listen, everyone! I've been telling the truth from the start. I am the Seer, and I saw Michael as a Werewolf. Andrei and Semira's claim as Masons supports this because it means the other Werewolf card is likely in the center. Dragos, your constant shifting of suspicion and defense of Michael is extremely suspicious. Are you the Minion trying to protect your Werewolf ally?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the Werewolf, I need to cast suspicion away from myself and onto someone else. Dragos has been inconsistent and defensive, which makes him an easy target. Additionally, if others follow this lead, it might result in Dragos getting the most votes, thus keeping me safe.
> **Michael [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Michael (the Werewolf) and ensure the village team doesn't win. Alexandra's correct claim about Michael being a Werewolf is the biggest threat to our team's success. By voting for Alexandra, I'm attempting to discredit her Seer claim and potentially eliminate a key village team member. This move also maintains my cover as a confused Villager, as it could be seen as me believing Alexandra's sudden accusation is suspicious. Eliminating Alexandra would remove the strongest evidence against Michael and increase our chances of winning.
> **Dragos [Minion]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have concrete evidence that Michael is a Werewolf. I saw his card during the night phase. Despite attempts by Dragos to cast doubt on my claim, the fact that Andrei and Semira confirm each other as Masons supports my information, as it means the other Werewolf card is likely in the center. Michael's behavior throughout the day, deflecting accusations and trying to cast suspicion on others, further reinforces my belief. Voting for Michael gives us the best chance of eliminating a Werewolf and securing a win for the village team.
> **Alexandra [Seer]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I know Semira is telling the truth. Alexandra's claim as the Seer pointing to Michael as a Werewolf aligns with this information. Michael's initial accusation against me and his subsequent shifting of blame to Dragos seems like classic Werewolf misdirection. Dragos's behavior is suspicious, but he could be the Minion trying to protect Michael. Voting for Michael as the most likely Werewolf gives us the best chance of winning the game for the village team.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I believe Alexandra's claim as the Seer is credible. She identified Michael as a Werewolf, which aligns with the fact that Andrei and I are Masons. Dragos' behavior has been suspicious, but it's more likely he's the Minion trying to protect Michael. By voting for Michael, we have the best chance of eliminating a Werewolf and winning the game for the village team.
> **Semira [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


The votes were:
* Michael : Werewolf : 3
* Dragos : Minion : 1
* Alexandra : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The villagers win.
