## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Viktor. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Stefan is a minion and is aware that Viktor is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Cristina. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Andrei. They are thinking about their action.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I think it's more valuable to look at another player's card rather than the center cards. By checking a player's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or confirm an ally. I'm choosing Stefan because he's the first player in the list, and having information about him early on could be crucial for guiding the discussion during the day phase. If Stefan turns out to be a Werewolf or Minion, it would be a significant advantage for the village team. If he's a villager or another beneficial role, I can use this information to build trust or create strategies during the day phase.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect attention away from Viktor, the actual werewolf. By casting suspicion on Andrei, I'm hoping to create confusion and misdirect the villagers. This also helps me appear as if I'm actively trying to find the werewolves, which is what a villager would do. Additionally, by targeting someone who's been quiet, I'm less likely to accidentally accuse a Seer or Mason who might have valuable information to counter my claim.
> **Stefan:** Hey everyone, I've been thinking... Andrei has been awfully quiet this whole time. Don't you think that's a bit suspicious? I mean, if he were a villager or had a useful role, wouldn't he be more eager to share information or ask questions? I'm starting to wonder if he might be hiding something... like being a werewolf.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know Stefan is the Minion. His attempt to cast suspicion on me is likely a strategy to divert attention from himself or the Werewolves. By questioning him directly, I'm hoping to put him on the defensive and potentially expose inconsistencies in his story. This could also draw out more information from other players as they observe our interaction.
> **Andrei:** Actually, Stefan, I find your accusation quite interesting. As someone who's been quietly observing, I couldn't help but notice how quick you were to point fingers. Tell me, why are you so eager to cast suspicion on others? What role are you claiming to have?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to maintain my cover as a villager while deflecting suspicion from myself and indirectly from Viktor, the actual werewolf. By responding to Andrei's accusation with a counter-question, I'm attempting to put him on the defensive and make him look more suspicious. This also gives me an opportunity to claim the villager role, which is safe and hard to disprove. By challenging Andrei to provide information, I'm setting a trap: if he claims a powerful role like Seer or Mason, it makes him a target; if he doesn't, he looks even more suspicious. This strategy keeps the focus on Andrei and away from Viktor or myself.
> **Stefan:** Whoa, Andrei, I didn't expect you to turn this around on me! I'm just trying to contribute to the discussion and point out what I've noticed. To answer your question, I'm a villager. I've been actively participating because I want to find the werewolves and protect our village. Now, let me ask you this: if you've been 'quietly observing,' what valuable information have you gathered? It seems convenient to deflect attention without providing any useful insights.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have concrete information about Stefan's role. Revealing this information now serves multiple purposes: it exposes Stefan as the Minion, potentially causing the real Werewolves to panic and make mistakes. It also establishes my credibility as the Seer, which can help rally the village team. By directly confronting Stefan, I'm forcing him to defend against a true accusation, which might lead to more revelations about the Werewolves' identities.
> **Andrei:** Stefan, your claim of being a villager doesn't quite add up. As the Seer, I saw your card during the night, and you're actually the Minion. Your attempt to cast suspicion on me makes sense now. Everyone, we need to focus on finding the Werewolves that Stefan is protecting!


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to discredit Andrei's claim of being the Seer, which is a direct threat to me and indirectly to Viktor (the actual werewolf). By questioning the timing and credibility of Andrei's claim, I'm attempting to cast doubt on his statement and maintain my cover. This also serves to create confusion among the villagers, making it harder for them to identify the true werewolf. Additionally, by suggesting that Andrei might be the 'real werewolf', I'm deflecting suspicion from both myself and Viktor while appearing to be actively helping the village team.
> **Stefan:** Hold on a second! Andrei, you're claiming to be the Seer now? That's awfully convenient timing, don't you think? I find it hard to believe that you'd stay quiet all this time if you truly had such crucial information. It seems more likely that you're trying to save yourself by making a false claim. Everyone, we shouldn't trust Andrei's sudden 'revelation'. He's probably the real werewolf trying to throw us off track!


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** By directing a question to Viktor, who has been quiet, I'm hoping to gather more information and potentially identify allies or enemies. His response to the conflict between Stefan and me could reveal his own role or allegiances. If Viktor supports my claim, it could strengthen the village team's position. If he sides with Stefan or provides evasive answers, it might indicate he's also part of the Werewolf team. This also serves to keep the focus on finding the Werewolves rather than letting Stefan's counter-accusation derail our progress.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, you've been awfully quiet. What's your take on Stefan's accusation against me and my revelation about his role? Do you have any information that could help us identify the Werewolves?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I'm trying to cast doubt on Andrei's claim of being the Seer while supporting Stefan, who could be the Minion and therefore an ally. This helps me divert suspicion away from myself and towards Andrei.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and consider what's happening here. Andrei claims to be the Seer and says Stefan is the Minion. Stefan, on the other hand, claims to be a Villager. Andrei, if you’re really the Seer, why did you wait until now to reveal such crucial information? It seems like a risky move to stay quiet for so long. Meanwhile, Stefan's accusation of Andrei being a werewolf also seems plausible given the timing of the revelation. I'm leaning towards believing Stefan because he's been actively participating and trying to help. Andrei's sudden claim seems more like an act of desperation.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to gather more information from the other players and see if there are any more roles that can be confirmed. This will help me generate confusion and divert attention away from myself. By encouraging others to speak up, I hope to create more opportunities to discredit Andrei's Seer claim and strengthen Stefan's position.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone, there's a lot of tension and accusations flying around. Let's try to piece this together logically. Andrei, you claim to be the Seer and you say Stefan is the Minion. But Stefan insists he's a Villager and is pointing fingers at you for being the Werewolf. Cristina and Selene, you've been quiet so far. Do either of you have any information that could help clarify this situation? We need to work together to figure this out. If there's another Mason or Villager out there, now might be the time to step forward with what you know.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to identify the Werewolves quickly. Andrei's behavior is raising red flags - his silence followed by a convenient claim to be the Seer seems like a desperate attempt to avoid suspicion. By questioning Andrei directly, I hope to either expose inconsistencies in his story or give him a chance to provide a convincing explanation. This could help the group determine if he's truly the Seer or potentially a Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Selene:** I've been listening carefully to everyone's arguments, and I have to say, I'm really concerned about Andrei. His sudden claim to be the Seer after being quiet for so long seems very suspicious. Stefan has been actively trying to help us from the beginning, which makes me more inclined to trust him. Andrei, can you explain why you waited so long to reveal such important information if you're really the Seer?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Selene's concerns directly, I'm attempting to reinforce my credibility as the Seer. Questioning her role and asking for information puts her in a position where she needs to contribute, potentially revealing more about her own allegiances. This also shifts the focus from defending myself to actively seeking out the Werewolves, which is what the village team should be doing. If Selene is a Villager or Mason, this gives her an opportunity to share information. If she's a Werewolf, her response might reveal inconsistencies or evasiveness.
> **Andrei:** Selene, I understand your concern, but think about it logically. If I were a Werewolf, why would I make such a bold claim that could easily be disproven? I waited to reveal my role because I wanted to gather more information first. But when Stefan started throwing accusations, I knew I had to speak up. Now, let me ask you this: what's your role, and do you have any information that could help us find the real Werewolves?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** By asking Andrei for more specific details about his claimed Seer actions, I'm giving him a chance to either provide convincing evidence or potentially expose inconsistencies in his story. If he's telling the truth, this information could help us identify the Werewolves. If he's lying, he might struggle to come up with a believable answer on the spot. This approach allows me to gather more information without revealing my own role or directly accusing anyone yet.
> **Selene:** Andrei, I appreciate your explanation, but I'm still not convinced. If you're truly the Seer, can you tell us who else you looked at during the night? This information could be crucial for us.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** By reiterating that I only looked at Stefan's card, I'm maintaining consistency in my story, which adds credibility to my claim as the Seer. Turning the question back on Selene and suggesting she might be a Werewolf serves two purposes: it puts pressure on her to reveal information about her role, and it shifts the focus of suspicion away from me. If Selene is indeed a Werewolf, this direct confrontation might cause her to make a mistake or reveal inconsistencies in her story. If she's not, it gives her an opportunity to clear her name and potentially provide valuable information to the village team.
> **Andrei:** Selene, I only looked at one player's card during the night, which was Stefan's. That's how I know he's the Minion. Now, you're avoiding my question about your role. Are you perhaps a Werewolf trying to protect Stefan?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm maintaining my role as a Villager while questioning Andrei's claim. By pointing out a potential flaw in his strategy as the Seer, I'm giving him another chance to explain himself or potentially expose inconsistencies. This approach keeps the pressure on Andrei without revealing too much about my own position. It also indirectly supports Stefan, who has been more consistently helpful throughout the game.
> **Selene:** Andrei, I'm not avoiding your question. I'm a Villager, and I'm trying to gather information to help our village. Your claim about being the Seer is still questionable. If you only looked at Stefan's card, why didn't you check the center cards for more information? That seems like a missed opportunity for a real Seer.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** I'm addressing Selene's question about why I didn't check the center cards, explaining my strategy as the Seer. By reaffirming Stefan's role as the Minion and shifting focus to finding the Werewolves, I'm trying to rally the village team and put pressure on potential Werewolves. This statement also serves to reinforce my credibility as the Seer and redirect the conversation towards our main goal of identifying the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Look, I understand the skepticism, but as the Seer, I made a strategic choice to look at a player's card instead of the center cards. Finding a Werewolf or Minion early on is crucial. Now, we're wasting time doubting me when we should be focusing on finding the Werewolves. Stefan is the Minion, and that's a fact. So, who's protecting him? That's what we need to figure out.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know for sure that the other Mason card is in the center. This information directly contradicts Andrei's claim of being the Seer and seeing Stefan's card. By revealing this, I can help clear Stefan's name and cast strong suspicion on Andrei, who is likely a Werewolf trying to confuse the village. This move aligns with my goal of helping the villagers find the Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Hey everyone, I've been quiet because I've been trying to piece things together, but I can't stay silent anymore. I'm one of the Masons, and I can tell you with certainty that the other Mason card is in the center. This means Andrei can't be the Seer because there's no way he could have seen Stefan's card. Stefan, I believe you're telling the truth about being a Villager. Andrei, your lie about being the Seer makes me think you're actually a Werewolf trying to mislead us all!


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to create confusion and protect Viktor, the actual Werewolf. Cristina's claim threatens Andrei, who I've been supporting to divert attention from Viktor. By casting doubt on Cristina's statement, I'm attempting to create a new layer of suspicion and confusion. This serves multiple purposes: it keeps the focus off Viktor, potentially discredits Cristina (a villager role), and gives Andrei (who I've been supporting) a potential out. It also makes me appear as a thoughtful villager who's considering all angles, further cementing my cover.
> **Stefan:** Wait a minute, everyone! Cristina's claim about being a Mason changes everything. If she's telling the truth, then Andrei is definitely lying about being the Seer. But here's what's bothering me - why would Andrei make such a bold and easily disprovable claim? It almost seems too obvious. What if... what if Cristina is actually the Werewolf, trying to frame Andrei? Think about it - she's been quiet this whole time and suddenly comes out with this information that completely shifts the game. I'm starting to think we need to be very careful about who we trust here.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's claim directly contradicts my role as the Seer, which I know to be true. Her sudden involvement after being quiet raises red flags. By questioning her motives and suggesting she might be a Werewolf, I'm attempting to discredit her claim and maintain my position as the Seer. This also keeps the focus on finding the Werewolves and protects the village team from being misled. If Cristina is indeed a Werewolf, this direct confrontation might cause her to make a mistake or reveal inconsistencies in her story.
> **Andrei:** Hold on everyone! Cristina's sudden revelation is highly suspicious. Why come forward now with such game-changing information? It seems too convenient. I stand by my claim as the Seer, and I know for a fact that Stefan is the Minion. Cristina, are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to create chaos and protect Stefan?


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly confronting Andrei and reaffirming my role as a Mason, I'm reinforcing the truth of my earlier statement. This puts more pressure on Andrei and makes his lie more apparent to others. It also indirectly supports Stefan, who I believe is likely telling the truth about being a Villager. By encouraging everyone to focus on Andrei, I'm trying to unite the village against a probable Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, your accusation against me is absurd! I've been quiet because I was trying to gather information, but when I heard your false claim about being the Seer, I knew I had to speak up. As a Mason, I have crucial information that exposes your lie. Everyone, we need to focus on Andrei - he's clearly trying to mislead us, which is exactly what a Werewolf would do!


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** I'm reaffirming my position as the Seer and questioning Cristina's credibility. By calling for others to reveal their roles, I'm hoping to put pressure on the Werewolves and gather more information. This also shifts the focus back to our main goal of finding the Werewolves, rather than getting caught up in accusations against me.
> **Andrei:** Listen, everyone! We're getting sidetracked by all these accusations. The fact remains that I, as the Seer, saw Stefan as the Minion. Cristina's claim doesn't add up - why would a Mason wait this long to reveal such crucial information? We need to focus on finding the Werewolves. Who here hasn't claimed a role yet? Speak up now, because our village depends on it!


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to cast doubt on Andrei's claim and support Stefan's position. By reinforcing Cristina's Mason claim and pointing out the inconsistencies in Andrei's story, I can divert suspicion away from myself and create more confusion among the other players.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, there's a lot of back and forth going on, and we need to stay focused. Andrei's claim to be the Seer and his accusation against Stefan as the Minion is very suspicious, especially since Cristina claims to be a Mason and points out inconsistencies in Andrei's story. Now, Selene, you say you're a Villager and you're skeptical of Andrei's sudden claim. It seems like Andrei is the odd one out here with his story not adding up. If we're to trust Cristina's claim as the Mason, then it makes sense that Andrei is trying to mislead us. Let's not get distracted by too many claims; we need to focus on the inconsistencies.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Viktor (the Werewolf) while appearing to be a helpful villager. Voting for Andrei serves multiple purposes: it aligns with the majority's suspicion, making me seem like I'm cooperating with the village. It also eliminates a player who's not the Werewolf, bringing us closer to a Werewolf victory. By supporting Cristina's claim indirectly, I'm building trust with other players, which could be useful in future rounds if the game continues. This vote maintains my cover as a villager while still working towards the Werewolf team's goals.
> **Stefan [Minion]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know for certain that Stefan is the Minion. Cristina's claim to be a Mason directly contradicts my role and information. Her sudden revelation after being quiet for so long is highly suspicious. By voting for Cristina, I'm attempting to eliminate a potential Werewolf who is trying to discredit me and protect the real Minion. This vote aligns with my goal of helping the village team win by identifying and eliminating threats.
> **Andrei [Seer]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Andrei's claim of being the Seer has been heavily disputed by Cristina, who claims to be a Mason, and there are inconsistencies in his story. Voting for Andrei seems like the best way to eliminate a potential Werewolf and divert attention away from me.
> **Viktor [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe Andrei is the most suspicious player. His claim to be the Seer doesn't add up, especially after Cristina revealed she's a Mason and pointed out the inconsistencies in his story. Andrei's behavior of staying quiet and then making a bold, easily disprovable claim aligns with typical Werewolf tactics. His accusation against Stefan as the Minion seems like a desperate attempt to misdirect us. Given the information we have, voting for Andrei gives us the best chance of eliminating a Werewolf and protecting the village.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know for certain that the other Mason card is in the center. This directly contradicts Andrei's claim of being the Seer and seeing Stefan's card. Andrei's false claim and attempts to mislead the group strongly suggest he is a Werewolf trying to create chaos and misdirect the village. By voting for Andrei, I'm trying to eliminate a probable Werewolf and protect the village team.
> **Cristina [Mason]:** I am voting for Andrei.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Seer : 4
* Cristina : Mason : 1



>***GAME:*** Andrei was killed. The werewolves win.
