## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Larisa. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Marius is a minion and is aware that Larisa is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Mircea and Ileana. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Viktor. They are thinking about their action.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I believe it's more beneficial to look at another player's card rather than the center cards. By checking a player's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or confirm a villager role. I've chosen Marius because, in my experience, Werewolves often try to blend in by not drawing attention to themselves early in the game. Marius hasn't stood out to me yet, which makes him a good candidate to investigate. If he turns out to be a Werewolf, it gives me crucial information. If he's not, I can use this knowledge to build trust with him later in the game.


The seer looked at a card from Marius and saw the card Minion

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect Larisa, the known Werewolf, and misdirect suspicion towards others. By casting doubt on Viktor, who is not the Werewolf, I'm attempting to shift focus away from Larisa. This also helps me appear proactive and engaged, which is how a Villager might act. Additionally, by asking for others' opinions, I'm trying to gather more information about how the other players are thinking, which can help me better protect Larisa in future interactions.
> **Marius:** Hey everyone, I've been thinking... Viktor has been awfully quiet so far. Don't you think that's a bit suspicious? In my experience, Werewolves often try to lay low and avoid drawing attention to themselves. What do you all think about Viktor's behavior?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is the other Mason and therefore on the village team. By directing a question to her, I'm giving her an opportunity to speak up and potentially provide valuable information to the group. This also subtly deflects suspicion from her while not outright defending her, which could raise suspicions about our connection. Additionally, getting Ileana to speak might help us identify the Werewolves based on their reactions to her response.
> **Mircea:** I don't think we should jump to conclusions about Viktor just yet. Ileana, you've been pretty quiet too. What's your take on all this?


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Mircea is on the village team, so I want to deflect suspicion from him. By questioning Marius's quick accusation of Viktor, I'm trying to draw attention to potential werewolf tactics while also giving Viktor a chance to defend himself. This could help us gather more information and potentially identify the real threats.
> **Ileana:** Mircea, I appreciate your concern, but I've actually been observing carefully. I think we should be more worried about Marius. He was quick to accuse Viktor without any real evidence. That's classic werewolf behavior, trying to divert attention from themselves. What do you think about that, Marius?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Larisa (the known Werewolf). By turning Ileana's accusation back on her, I'm attempting to discredit her and make her seem suspicious. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the focus off me, potentially casts doubt on Ileana (a possible villager), and subtly reinforces the idea that Viktor might be suspicious (though I'm not directly accusing him anymore). By suggesting that Ileana might be protecting Viktor, I'm also trying to create confusion and potential conflict among the other players, which can help hide Larisa's identity as the Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Whoa, Ileana! I'm just trying to get the conversation going and share my observations. Accusing me of being a werewolf right off the bat seems pretty defensive, don't you think? If anything, your quick deflection makes me more suspicious of you. Why are you so eager to shift attention away from Viktor and onto me? Are you trying to protect him?


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Mircea is on the village team, so I want to continue deflecting suspicion from him. By pressing Marius on his behavior, I'm trying to expose potential werewolf tactics while also giving the group more information to work with. This approach allows me to indirectly support Mircea without revealing our connection, and it puts pressure on Marius to explain his actions, which could reveal more about his true role.
> **Ileana:** Marius, I find it interesting that you're so quick to turn the tables on me. As a matter of fact, I've been quiet because I've been carefully observing everyone's behavior. Your immediate accusation of Viktor and now your defensive reaction to my question are raising red flags for me. Can you explain why you're so eager to cast suspicion on others?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to keep suspicion away from Larisa (the known Werewolf) and myself. By apologizing to Ileana, I'm attempting to appear reasonable and less suspicious. However, I'm still subtly pushing attention towards Viktor and Ileana. By directly asking Viktor a question, I'm forcing him to speak up, which could potentially make him look suspicious depending on his response. This also takes the focus off me and Larisa. Additionally, by asking for insights about the werewolves, I'm playing the role of a concerned villager, further cementing my facade.
> **Marius:** Look, I understand everyone's on edge, but let's take a step back for a moment. Ileana, I apologize if I came across as overly defensive. I was just trying to share my observations and get everyone talking. That being said, I'm still curious about why you're so quick to dismiss my concerns about Viktor. Viktor, you've been awfully quiet this whole time. What's your take on all of this? Do you have any insights that might help us figure out who the werewolves are?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know Marius is the Minion. By revealing this information, I'm hoping to gain the trust of the other players and potentially expose the Werewolves. Marius's reaction to this accusation could also provide valuable information to the group. If he denies it vehemently or tries to deflect, it might make him look more suspicious to others.
> **Viktor:** Marius, I couldn't help but notice that you were quick to accuse me of being a Werewolf. As the Seer, I can tell you with certainty that you're the Minion. Care to explain your strategy here?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to discredit Viktor's claim of being the Seer and his accusation against me. By questioning why he didn't reveal his role earlier, I'm casting doubt on his credibility. I'm also deflecting the accusation by suggesting that his claim is a Werewolf tactic to confuse the village. This serves to protect both myself and Larisa (the actual Werewolf) while keeping suspicion on Viktor. By maintaining my facade of helping the village, I'm trying to appear as a concerned Villager rather than the Minion.
> **Marius:** Whoa, Viktor! That's a bold accusation you're throwing out there. As the Seer? Really? If you were actually the Seer, why didn't you speak up earlier when I was asking for insights? It seems awfully convenient that you're claiming this role now. And accusing me of being the Minion? That's just absurd. I think everyone here can see I've been trying to help the village. Isn't it more likely that you're the Werewolf trying to throw us off the scent?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly confronting Marius and asking for an explanation, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal more information. His reaction could provide valuable clues to the other players. If he continues to deflect or becomes overly defensive, it might make him look more suspicious to the group. Additionally, by reaffirming my role as the Seer and explaining my reasoning for revealing the information now, I'm attempting to build credibility with the other players.
> **Viktor:** Marius, your deflection and attempt to discredit me only strengthens my suspicion. As the Seer, I chose to reveal this information now because I wanted to observe everyone's behavior first. Can you explain why you're so desperate to shift attention away from yourself?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to continue discrediting Viktor's claim of being the Seer while also deflecting suspicion from myself. By questioning Viktor's timing and suggesting his claim is a Werewolf tactic, I'm sowing doubt about his credibility. Additionally, by directing a question to Larisa (the actual Werewolf), I'm giving her an opportunity to speak and potentially defend herself or cast suspicion elsewhere. This serves multiple purposes: it makes me appear proactive and concerned about finding the truth (like a Villager would be), it keeps the focus on Viktor, and it brings Larisa into the conversation in a way that doesn't draw suspicion to her. By asking for Larisa's opinion, I'm also subtly suggesting that she might have valuable insights, which could help establish her credibility if she chooses to defend herself or accuse someone else.
> **Marius:** Viktor, I find it interesting that you're suddenly claiming to be the Seer and accusing me of being the Minion. It's a classic Werewolf tactic to falsely claim a powerful role to throw suspicion off themselves. If you really were the Seer, why didn't you share any information earlier when it could have been helpful? And Larisa, you've been awfully quiet this whole time. What's your take on Viktor's sudden revelation?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Viktor's claim of being the Seer seems like a strategic move to deflect suspicion. By questioning his timing and intentions, I can cast doubt on his role and divert attention away from myself.
> **Larisa:** Everyone, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture here. Viktor's sudden claim of being the Seer is quite convenient and, if I'm being honest, a bit suspicious. If he truly were the Seer, wouldn't it make more sense for him to reveal that information earlier to help us? Instead, he waited until he was directly questioned. And Marius has been quite vocal, which doesn't seem like Minion behavior to me. It feels more like someone genuinely trying to get us to discuss and figure things out. What do you all think about Viktor's behavior?


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Mircea is on the village team, so I want to protect him and find the real threats. Larisa's sudden involvement and attempt to discredit both Viktor and Marius is suspicious. By questioning her motives, I'm trying to draw attention to her behavior while also giving the group more information to work with. This approach allows me to indirectly support Mircea and Viktor (who claims to be the Seer) without revealing my role, and it puts pressure on Larisa to explain her actions, which could reveal more about her true role.
> **Ileana:** Hold on a second, everyone. Larisa, I find it interesting that you're suddenly jumping to Viktor's defense. You've been quiet this whole time, and now you're trying to discredit both Viktor and Marius. That seems pretty suspicious to me. Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to create chaos and confusion among us?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea has been trying to moderate the conversation without committing to any particular suspicion. By pressing him to share more specific thoughts, I can potentially expose inconsistencies or force him to take a stance that others might find questionable, thereby diverting attention from myself.
> **Larisa:** Mircea, you've been pretty vocal about not jumping to conclusions, but you haven't shared much about your own thoughts or suspicions. Why don't you tell us who you think is acting the most suspiciously and why?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is on the village team, so I want to avoid casting suspicion on her. Viktor's behavior is genuinely concerning, and by questioning him, I'm hoping to either expose him as a Werewolf or give him a chance to provide more convincing evidence of his claimed Seer role. This also aligns with Larisa's skepticism, potentially building trust with her if she's a villager. By focusing on Viktor, I'm also indirectly supporting Marius, who seems to be actively trying to help the village, which is more likely villager behavior than Werewolf or Minion behavior.
> **Mircea:** Larisa, I appreciate you asking for my thoughts. I've been observing carefully, and I'm becoming increasingly suspicious of Viktor. His sudden claim to be the Seer when cornered seems like a desperate move. If he were truly the Seer, why wait until now to reveal such crucial information? It feels like he's trying to save himself by causing confusion.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly addressing Mircea's suspicions and asking about his role, I'm attempting to shift the focus onto him and potentially expose inconsistencies in his story. This could help identify if he's a Werewolf or another role. Additionally, by explaining my strategy as the Seer, I'm trying to build credibility with the other players and justify my earlier silence.
> **Viktor:** Mircea, I understand your suspicion, but let me explain. As the Seer, I chose to observe everyone's behavior first before revealing my role. It's a strategy to gather more information. Now, I have a question for you: If you're so quick to doubt me, what role are you claiming? And how do you explain your own behavior so far?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is on the village team, so I want to avoid casting suspicion on her. Viktor's sudden claim to be the Seer is very suspicious and could be a Werewolf tactic. By directly questioning him about his supposed Seer actions, I'm giving him a chance to either prove his claim or potentially expose himself as a liar. This also aligns with my previous statement, maintaining consistency in my suspicion of Viktor. If he can't provide convincing information, it will strengthen the case against him and help the village team.
> **Mircea:** Viktor, your claim to be the Seer is quite convenient. If you're truly the Seer, can you tell us what information you've gathered? Who did you check during the night phase?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Mircea's question and providing the information he asked for, I'm demonstrating transparency and reinforcing my claim as the Seer. Revealing that I checked Marius and found him to be the Minion aligns with my earlier accusation. By then turning the question back to Mircea and asking about his role, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal information. This could potentially expose inconsistencies in his story or help identify if he's a Werewolf. It also shifts the focus of suspicion away from me and onto Mircea, who has been vocal in doubting my claim without offering much about himself.
> **Viktor:** Mircea, I appreciate your question. As the Seer, I checked Marius during the night phase and discovered he's the Minion. I revealed this information when I did because I wanted to observe everyone's reactions first. Now, I'm curious about your role. You seem eager to cast doubt on me, but you haven't shared anything about yourself. What role are you claiming?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is on the village team, so I want to protect her. Viktor's story about being the Seer is becoming less credible. His delayed revelation and convenient accusation of Marius as the Minion seem like classic Werewolf tactics. By directly challenging Viktor and accusing him of being a Werewolf, I'm hoping to either expose him or force him to provide more convincing evidence. This also aligns with my previous suspicions and maintains consistency in my behavior. If Viktor is indeed a Werewolf, exposing him would be a significant win for the village team.
> **Mircea:** Viktor, your claim to be the Seer is getting more suspicious by the minute. If you really checked Marius and found him to be the Minion, why didn't you share this crucial information right away? It seems like you're making things up as you go along. I think you're actually a Werewolf trying to create chaos and confusion among us!


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's aggressive accusation without providing any information about his own role is suspicious. By challenging him to reveal his role, I'm putting pressure on him to either come clean or potentially expose himself as a Werewolf. This also shifts the focus of suspicion from me to him, which could help protect me as the true Seer. Additionally, by maintaining my stance and questioning his motives, I'm reinforcing my credibility to the other players.
> **Viktor:** Mircea, your accusation is baseless and only makes you look more suspicious. If you're so confident, why don't you tell us your role? Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to create chaos?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is the other Mason and therefore trustworthy. Viktor's claim to be the Seer has been inconsistent and suspicious from the start. By revealing my role as a Mason and directly accusing Viktor of being a Werewolf, I'm taking a calculated risk. This move serves multiple purposes: it adds credibility to my accusations against Viktor, potentially exposes him as a Werewolf, and indirectly supports Ileana without explicitly revealing her role. Additionally, by claiming the Mason role, I'm providing valuable information to the village team while making it harder for the real Werewolf to claim a false role.
> **Mircea:** Viktor, your sudden defensive attitude and attempt to deflect suspicion onto me is very telling. As a Mason, I can confidently say that you're not on the village team. I think it's becoming clear to everyone that you're a Werewolf trying to sow discord among us!

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect Larisa (the known Werewolf) and eliminate villagers. Viktor has claimed to be the Seer and accused me of being the Minion, which is correct but dangerous for our team. By voting for Viktor, I'm attempting to eliminate a potential threat to Larisa while also maintaining my cover. Viktor's claim has made him a target, and voting for him aligns with the village's suspicions, making me appear less suspicious. This vote also helps create chaos and confusion, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Marius [Minion]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I'm confident that Viktor is not on the village team. His claim to be the Seer has been inconsistent and suspicious throughout the game. He only revealed his supposed role when cornered and has provided convenient accusations without substantial evidence. His behavior aligns more with a Werewolf trying to create confusion than a genuine Seer. By voting for Viktor, I'm aiming to eliminate a likely Werewolf and secure a win for the village team.
> **Mircea [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Mircea is on the village team. Mircea has confidently claimed that Viktor is not on the village team, which aligns with Viktor's suspicious behavior throughout the game. Viktor's late claim of being the Seer and his inconsistent story about checking Marius raise red flags. Given the information available, voting for Viktor seems the best way to protect the village and potentially eliminate a Werewolf.
> **Ileana [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I'm confident in my role and the information I've gathered. Mircea's aggressive accusations without providing any substantial information about his own role earlier in the game are highly suspicious. His sudden claim to be a Mason seems like a desperate attempt to discredit me. His behavior throughout the game, particularly his reluctance to share information and his quick accusations, align more with Werewolf tactics than those of a true villager. By voting for Mircea, I'm hoping to eliminate a potential Werewolf and protect the village team.
> **Viktor [Seer]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Viktor's claim to be the Seer seems very convenient and poorly timed. If he truly were the Seer, he would have shared his information earlier to help the village. His sudden revelation when under pressure and his accusation of Marius being the Minion appears to be a desperate move to deflect suspicion. Additionally, Mircea's claim as a Mason further discredits Viktor's role claim. By voting for Viktor, I can cast doubt on his credibility and help shift the focus away from myself.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Viktor.


The votes were:
* Mircea : Mason : 1
* Viktor : Seer : 4



>***GAME:*** Viktor was killed. The werewolves win.
