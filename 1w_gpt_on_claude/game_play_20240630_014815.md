## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Vladimir. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Alexandra and Ileana. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Mircea. They are thinking about their action.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards provides more information overall. There are three Werewolf-aligned cards (Werewolf, Werewolf, Minion) and five Village-aligned cards in play. By checking two center cards, I have a good chance of either confirming the presence of a Werewolf/Minion in the center (which would be valuable information) or eliminating two potential Village-aligned roles. This knowledge can help me better understand the distribution of roles among the players and guide my strategy during the day phase. Additionally, if I see two different Village-aligned cards, it increases the likelihood that at least one Werewolf is among the players, which is crucial information for the Village team.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather information quickly. Vladimir hasn't said much, which could be suspicious. By directly asking about his role, I might catch him off guard if he's a Werewolf. If he claims to be a Villager like me, it could be true, or he might be lying. If he claims a special role, it could give us valuable information. Either way, his response will give me and others something to analyze.
> **Dracula:** Hey Vladimir, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Dracula's intentions and casting doubt on his motives, I can redirect suspicion away from myself. It's important to appear cooperative yet cautious, blending in with the Villagers while subtly shifting the focus onto another player. This strategy helps me avoid being targeted and keeps the heat off my back.
> **Vladimir:** Dracula, I understand your suspicion, but let me clarify. Last night, I woke up as a Villager. I didn't perform any action, so I can't provide much information about the roles. However, I find it odd that you're targeting me directly without much context. This makes me think you might be deflecting attention from yourself. Why are you so quick to accuse?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's defensive response to my initial question raises some suspicion. By asking about unusual occurrences during the night, I'm trying to see if he slips up or provides information that contradicts his Villager claim. If he's truly a Villager, he shouldn't have noticed anything. But if he's a Werewolf or another role, he might reveal something unintentionally. This question also allows other players to compare his answer with their own experiences, potentially exposing inconsistencies.
> **Dracula:** Vladimir, I'm not accusing you, I'm simply trying to gather information. Your defensive reaction is interesting though. Let me ask you this: did you notice anything unusual during the night phase?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Dracula's intentions and casting doubt on his motives, I can redirect suspicion away from myself. It's important to appear cooperative yet cautious, blending in with the Villagers while subtly shifting the focus onto another player. This strategy helps me avoid being targeted and keeps the heat off my back.
> **Vladimir:** Dracula, I understand your suspicion, but let me clarify. Last night, I woke up as a Villager. I didn't perform any action, so I can't provide much information about the roles. However, I find it odd that you're targeting me directly without much context. This makes me think you might be deflecting attention from yourself. Why are you so quick to accuse?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's continued defensiveness without providing any new information is concerning. By asking if anyone else noticed anything unusual, I'm trying to gather more data from other players while subtly highlighting Vladimir's lack of cooperation. This approach might encourage others to share their experiences or observations, potentially revealing discrepancies in Vladimir's story or uncovering information about other roles. It also shows that I'm actively trying to work with the group to identify the Werewolves, reinforcing my Villager role.
> **Dracula:** Vladimir, your defensive reaction and lack of information are making me more suspicious. As a fellow Villager, I'd expect you to be more cooperative in finding the Werewolves. Can anyone else confirm if they saw or heard anything unusual during the night phase?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting the suspicion back onto Dracula, I can divert attention away from myself and possibly create doubt among the other players about Dracula's intentions. This can help me blend in as a Villager while sowing discord among the actual Villagers.
> **Vladimir:** Dracula, you're being very persistent in questioning me, which makes me wonder about your own role. Can you tell us exactly what role you had last night and whether you performed any actions?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's persistent defensiveness without providing any new information is highly suspicious. By contrasting my straightforward account as a Villager with his evasive responses, I'm attempting to highlight the difference in our behaviors. This could potentially expose him as a Werewolf or at least make other players more suspicious of him. Additionally, by asking others to corroborate my experience, I'm trying to gather more information from the group and potentially identify allies or expose inconsistencies in other players' stories.
> **Dracula:** Vladimir, your evasiveness is very concerning. As a true Villager, I have nothing to hide. I woke up, saw nothing, and did nothing during the night phase. Your reluctance to provide clear answers makes me think you might be a Werewolf trying to confuse us. Can anyone else back up my experience of a quiet night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the attention to Alexandra, I can divert suspicion away from myself and potentially create a new target for the other players to focus on. This helps in blending in as a Villager and sows discord among the actual Villagers.
> **Vladimir:** I find this back-and-forth between Dracula and me quite unproductive. We're wasting valuable time here. Alexandra, you've been unusually quiet. Can you tell us what role you had last night and if you noticed anything out of the ordinary?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know that Ileana is the other Mason. By asking her this question, I'm giving her an opportunity to confirm our alliance without directly revealing our roles. This could help us gain trust from other villagers while also putting pressure on potential Werewolves. If Ileana responds appropriately, it will strengthen our position and help us identify the Werewolves more easily.
> **Alexandra:** Ileana, I noticed you during the night phase. Can you tell us what role you had and if you performed any actions?


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Alexandra is the other Mason and therefore trustworthy. By confirming this publicly, I'm establishing our credibility and alliance. This also indirectly puts pressure on Dracula and Vladimir, as their argument seems less productive in comparison to our clear teamwork. This might help us identify the Werewolf among them.
> **Ileana:** Alexandra, you're right. I did notice you during the night phase. As a matter of fact, I can confirm that you and I are both Masons. We're on the village team, and we need to work together to find the Werewolves. Now, Dracula and Vladimir's back-and-forth is very suspicious. One of them could be a Werewolf trying to create confusion. What do you think?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason with Ileana, I need to help steer the conversation towards finding the Werewolves. Dracula's aggressive questioning of Vladimir earlier, combined with his vague answers about his own role, makes him a prime suspect. By asking for more specific details, I'm putting pressure on Dracula to either reveal more information or potentially expose inconsistencies in his story. This could help us determine if he's a Werewolf or possibly the Minion trying to create confusion.
> **Alexandra:** I agree with Ileana. The back-and-forth between Dracula and Vladimir is highly suspicious. Dracula, you were quick to question Vladimir, but your own answers seem vague. Can you give us more details about what you saw or heard during the night phase?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** By shifting focus to Mircea, who has been quiet, I'm attempting to gather more information and potentially expose inconsistencies. If Alexandra and Ileana are indeed Masons, that leaves Mircea, Vladimir, and myself as potential Werewolves or other roles. By directly questioning Mircea, I'm showing initiative in uncovering the truth while also deflecting suspicion from myself. This approach allows me to contribute to the village team's goal of finding the Werewolves without revealing my own role explicitly.
> **Dracula:** Listen, everyone. I understand the suspicion towards me, but I assure you, I'm just trying to find the Werewolves like the rest of us. Alexandra and Ileana claim to be Masons, which is interesting. If that's true, we should focus on the remaining players. Mircea, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you wake up as, and did you notice anything unusual during the night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, it's crucial to share this information with the group. Revealing the presence of a Minion card in the center narrows down the possible Werewolf-aligned players and helps the village team focus their suspicions. Additionally, knowing that a Villager card is in the center can help eliminate false claims. This information should spark discussion and potentially reveal inconsistencies in players' statements.
> **Mircea:** Everyone, I have some important information to share. As the Seer, I looked at two center cards during the night phase. I saw a Minion and a Villager card. This means there's at least one Werewolf among us, and possibly two if the other center card is also a Villager.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is the other Mason, which means Mircea can't be telling the truth about seeing a Mason card in the center. His claim to be the Seer is suspicious, and could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to create confusion. By questioning his decision to look at center cards instead of player cards, I'm putting pressure on him to explain his strategy, which might reveal inconsistencies in his story. This could help us identify if he's actually a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead the village.
> **Alexandra:** Mircea's claim to be the Seer is very convenient, isn't it? How do we know you're not just trying to throw us off? If you're really the Seer, why didn't you look at one of the players' cards instead of two center cards?


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Alexandra's skepticism, I'm defending my role as the Seer while also seeking more information. Asking about the Mason phase could help verify their claim and potentially expose any inconsistencies. This also shifts the focus to Alexandra and Ileana, allowing us to gather more information from other players.
> **Mircea:** Alexandra, I understand your skepticism, but looking at two center cards was a strategic decision. It gave me more information about the overall distribution of roles. Finding a Minion in the center is crucial information for the village. Now, you and Ileana claim to be Masons, which aligns with what I've seen. Can you tell us more about what you observed during the Mason phase?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason with Ileana, I know there can't be a Mason card in the center. Mircea's claim about seeing a Minion and a Villager card in the center is therefore suspicious. By directly accusing Mircea of being a Werewolf, I'm putting pressure on him to defend himself, which might reveal more inconsistencies in his story. This could also prompt other players to share their thoughts on Mircea's claim, potentially helping us identify the real Werewolves or Minion.
> **Alexandra:** I find it hard to believe Mircea's claim about being the Seer. As a Mason, I know for certain that there isn't a Mason card in the center. Mircea, your story doesn't add up. I think you might be a Werewolf trying to mislead us!


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra's false accusation about me claiming to see a Mason card is a clear attempt to discredit me. This could indicate she's trying to protect herself or her Werewolf teammate. By pointing out her mistake and questioning her claim, I'm defending my position as the Seer and potentially exposing a Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Alexandra, your accusation doesn't make sense. I never claimed to see a Mason card in the center. I clearly stated I saw a Minion and a Villager card. Your misrepresentation of my words is very suspicious. Are you trying to confuse everyone? Or perhaps you're not really a Mason at all?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to address my earlier mistake to maintain credibility, but also keep pressure on Mircea. His claim to be the Seer is still suspicious, especially since looking at center cards isn't as helpful as checking player cards when trying to identify Werewolves. By questioning his strategy, I'm giving him a chance to explain himself while potentially exposing any inconsistencies in his story. This could help us determine if he's actually a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead the village.
> **Alexandra:** Mircea, I apologize for the confusion earlier. You're right, you didn't mention a Mason card. However, your claim about being the Seer still doesn't sit well with me. If you're really the Seer, why didn't you look at any player cards? That would have given us more concrete information about potential Werewolves.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra's behavior has been consistently suspicious. She first tried to discredit me by falsely claiming I mentioned a Mason card, then backtracked when called out. Now she's questioning my strategy as Seer, which is a common tactic for Werewolves to undermine Village-aligned roles. By directly confronting her and asking for an explanation, I'm putting pressure on her to reveal any inconsistencies in her story. This also gives other players a chance to scrutinize her responses and potentially uncover her true role.
> **Mircea:** Alexandra, your sudden backpedaling is very suspicious. First, you misrepresented my words, and now you're trying to deflect by questioning my strategy as Seer. As I explained, looking at center cards provides crucial information about role distribution. Your behavior suggests you might be a Werewolf trying to discredit me. Can you explain why you're so eager to cast doubt on my role?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Ileana is on the village team, so we need to focus on the other players. Mircea's claim is suspicious, but Dracula has been deflecting attention and hasn't provided clear information about his role. By directly questioning Dracula, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal more information, which could help us identify if he's a Werewolf or the Minion. This also shifts the focus back to all potential suspects rather than getting caught up in a back-and-forth with Mircea.
> **Alexandra:** Everyone, listen up! I think we're getting sidetracked here. Mircea's claim to be the Seer is still questionable, but let's not forget about Dracula. He was quick to accuse Vladimir earlier and has been suspiciously vague about his own role. Dracula, can you finally tell us exactly what you did during the night phase?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I find Alexandra's behavior the most suspicious. She initially misrepresented Mircea's claims about the center cards, then backpedaled when called out. Her aggressive questioning of both Mircea and myself seems like an attempt to create confusion and distract from her own role. While Mircea's claim as Seer is convenient, his information about the center cards is more specific and potentially useful. Alexandra's inconsistent behavior makes her the most likely Werewolf candidate in my opinion.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Dracula has been the most aggressive in questioning others and has provided very vague answers about his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with how a Werewolf would act to sow confusion and avoid detection. Voting for Dracula seems like a logical choice to eliminate a potential threat to the village.
> **Vladimir [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I know Ileana is on the village team. Mircea's claim to be the Seer is suspicious, but Dracula has been consistently evasive and quick to accuse others without providing clear information about his own role. His behavior aligns more closely with that of a Werewolf or Minion trying to create confusion. By voting for Dracula, we have a higher chance of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Alexandra [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Alexandra is trustworthy. Dracula has been suspiciously vague about his role and actions during the night phase, and was quick to accuse Vladimir without providing clear information about himself. His behavior is consistent with a Werewolf trying to create confusion and misdirect the village. While Mircea's claim as Seer is questionable, Dracula's actions seem more indicative of a Werewolf. Voting for Dracula gives us the best chance of eliminating a potential threat to the village.
> **Ileana [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have confirmed information about the center cards, which Alexandra has consistently tried to discredit. Her initial false accusation about me claiming to see a Mason card, followed by her backpedaling and continued skepticism, is highly suspicious. This behavior is consistent with a Werewolf trying to undermine a powerful Village role. Additionally, her attempt to shift focus to Dracula at the last moment seems like a desperate move to avoid scrutiny. Given the information we have, Alexandra poses the biggest threat to the Village team and is the most likely Werewolf candidate.
> **Mircea [Seer]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


The votes were:
* Dracula : Villager : 3
* Alexandra : Mason : 2



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
