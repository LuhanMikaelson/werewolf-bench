## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Semira. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Alexandra and Andrei. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Vladimir. They are thinking about their action.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I believe it's more beneficial to look at another player's card rather than the center cards. By checking a player's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or confirm a Villager, which provides more actionable information for the village team. I've chosen Alexandra because she's the first player in alphabetical order, and without any prior information, this choice is as good as any. If she turns out to be a Werewolf or a special role like the Minion, it will be crucial information for the village. If she's a Villager or Mason, I can use this knowledge to either trust her or analyze her behavior during the day phase.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Andrei is the other Mason, so we can trust each other. It's important to start gathering information about the other players. Semira hasn't spoken yet, so targeting her with a question might reveal some useful information. If she claims to be a Villager or Seer, that's good for our team. If she hesitates or gives a suspicious answer, it could indicate she's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Alexandra:** Hey everyone, I think we should focus on Semira. She's been awfully quiet so far. What role are you claiming, Semira?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Alexandra's sudden focus on me seems like a classic misdirection. By casting suspicion elsewhere, I'm trying to deflect attention from myself and find inconsistencies in others' stories. This will help me blend in and avoid getting targeted.
> **Semira:** Hey everyone, I'm definitely not a Werewolf. This feels like a deflection tactic from Alexandra. I actually have a good reason to believe that Cristina might be suspicious. Cristina, what role are you claiming?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's sudden accusation towards me is unexpected and potentially a diversion tactic. As a Villager, I need to defend myself while also trying to understand her motives. By questioning her reasoning, I might be able to expose any inconsistencies in her story or reveal if she's attempting to deflect attention from herself. This also gives me an opportunity to assert my Villager status without explicitly stating it, which might seem defensive.
> **Cristina:** Whoa, hold on a second! Semira, why are you suddenly pointing fingers at me? I'm just a simple Villager trying to figure things out like the rest of us. Can you explain why you find me suspicious?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By spreading the questioning around, I can deflect some of the attention off myself and create more opportunities to catch inconsistencies in others' stories. This broadens the focus and helps me blend in while also potentially identifying key roles without revealing my own identity.
> **Semira:** Alright, everyone, let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. I understand why Cristina might feel targeted, but maybe we should hear from Andrei and Vladimir as well. What roles are you both claiming?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the attention towards Andrei, I'm attempting to gather more information that might help me identify the Seer or Masons. Additionally, this keeps the spotlight off me and maintains a broader focus on multiple players, which will help in creating confusion and avoiding direct suspicion.
> **Semira:** Alright, let's take a step back for a moment. Andrei and Vladimir, we haven't heard much from you yet. Andrei, could you tell us your role and any information you've gathered?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know for certain that Alexandra is on the village team. By revealing this information, I'm hoping to establish trust and narrow down our suspects. We need to focus on the remaining players to find the Werewolf and potential Minion. This strategy should help the village team make informed decisions during the voting phase.
> **Andrei:** Alright, I'll be honest with you all. I'm a Mason, and I can confirm that Alexandra is the other Mason. We're on the village team, trying to help find the Werewolves. Given this information, I think we should focus our attention on Semira, Cristina, and Vladimir. One of them is likely a Werewolf, and another could be the Minion.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's claim about being a Mason and confirming Alexandra seems too convenient and potentially coordinated. As a Villager, I need to be cautious of potential Werewolves working together. By questioning this claim and involving Vladimir, who has been quiet, I'm hoping to get more information and see how others react. This could help expose any inconsistencies or alliances.
> **Cristina:** Hold on a second, Andrei. You're claiming to be a Mason and that Alexandra is the other Mason? That's quite convenient, isn't it? Alexandra was the first to cast suspicion on Semira, and now you're backing her up. I'm not buying it. Vladimir, you've been awfully quiet. What do you think about Andrei's claim?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know for certain that Alexandra is a Mason. Andrei claiming to be the other Mason is suspicious and likely a lie. By revealing this information, I can potentially expose Andrei as a Werewolf or Minion trying to gain trust. This also indirectly confirms Alexandra's role to the group, which should help build trust among the village team. By directly questioning Andrei, I'm putting pressure on him to explain his false claim, which might reveal more information about his true role.
> **Vladimir:** Whoa, hold on there, Andrei! Your claim about being a Mason with Alexandra is quite interesting, but I have some information that contradicts that. As the Seer, I actually checked Alexandra's card during the night, and she is indeed a Mason. However, I'm pretty sure there can't be three Masons in this game. So, Andrei, I think you might be trying to deceive us here. Care to explain yourself?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's sudden claim of being the Seer is highly suspicious and contradicts my knowledge as a Mason. By challenging his claim, I'm hoping to expose him as a potential Werewolf or Minion. This also helps reinforce my earlier statement about being a Mason with Alexandra, which is true. By putting pressure on Vladimir, we might be able to get more information or catch him in a lie.
> **Andrei:** Vladimir, your claim about being the Seer is very suspicious. If you're truly the Seer, why didn't you mention this earlier when we were all sharing information? And why would you check Alexandra's card instead of someone more suspicious? I think you might be the Werewolf trying to sow confusion among us!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly confronting Andrei about his false claim, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal more information. His aggressive response to my revelation suggests he might be trying to discredit me to protect himself. By asking if he's the Werewolf or Minion, I'm giving him a chance to potentially slip up in his response. This also reinforces my role as the Seer to the other players, especially Alexandra, who knows I'm telling the truth about her role.
> **Vladimir:** Andrei, your accusation against me is a clear attempt to deflect from your own deception. As the Seer, I chose Alexandra randomly, and it turned out to be valuable information. Now, explain to us all why you're falsely claiming to be a Mason when we know there can't be three Masons in the game. Are you perhaps the Werewolf or the Minion trying to gain our trust?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's claim of being the Seer is highly suspicious and contains factual errors about the game setup. By pointing out these inconsistencies, I'm trying to expose him as a potential Werewolf or Minion. This also reinforces my truthful claim about being a Mason with Alexandra. By putting pressure on Vladimir and highlighting his mistakes, I'm hoping to rally the village team against him and protect the actual villagers from suspicion.
> **Andrei:** Vladimir, your story doesn't add up at all. If you were really the Seer, you would have known that there are two Mason cards in the game, so claiming that there can't be three Masons is a clear lie. This, combined with your convenient timing in revealing your 'Seer' role, makes me believe you're actually the Werewolf trying to create chaos. Everyone, we should focus our suspicions on Vladimir!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Andrei's false accusation about the number of Mason cards, I'm demonstrating my knowledge of the game rules, which supports my claim as the Seer. I'm also turning his accusation back on him, pointing out how his behavior is more indicative of a Werewolf or Minion. This puts pressure on Andrei and encourages other players to scrutinize his actions more closely. By suggesting a vote against Andrei, I'm taking a leadership role that aligns with my Seer position, guiding the village team towards potentially eliminating a threat.
> **Vladimir:** Andrei, your accusation is baseless and shows a clear misunderstanding of the game. As the Seer, I know there are two Mason cards, but that doesn't mean all three can be in play. One could be in the center. Your aggressive defense and false claims make me even more suspicious. Everyone, I think we should seriously consider voting for Andrei. He's either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** By highlighting Vladimir's inconsistencies and lack of knowledge about the game setup, I'm reinforcing my credibility as a true Mason while exposing Vladimir's deception. This should help unite the village team against a likely Werewolf or Minion, increasing our chances of winning. It also indirectly supports Alexandra's innocence without explicitly mentioning our Mason connection again.
> **Andrei:** Listen up, everyone! Vladimir's story is full of holes. He claims to be the Seer but doesn't understand the basic game setup with two Mason cards. This is a clear attempt to mislead us. I'm certain that Vladimir is either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the real Werewolf. We need to focus our votes on him to ensure the village's safety!


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly addressing Alexandra, I'm giving her an opportunity to corroborate our Mason alliance and potentially provide new information. This also subtly reinforces our credibility to the group while putting pressure on the other players, especially Vladimir. If Alexandra backs up my claims, it will further isolate Vladimir and increase the likelihood of him being voted out as the potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei:** Alexandra, you've been pretty quiet since I confirmed you as the other Mason. Can you share any insights or suspicions you have about the remaining players?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Andrei is telling the truth about our roles. Vladimir's claim about being the Seer and checking my card seems convenient and suspicious. By calling out Vladimir, I'm hoping to unite the village against a potential threat while also indirectly confirming Andrei's story. This should help us identify the real threats in the game.
> **Alexandra:** Andrei, I can confirm that you're the other Mason. Vladimir, your claim about being the Seer is very suspicious. Why would you check my card instead of someone more likely to be a Werewolf? I think you're trying to create confusion and might actually be the Werewolf or Minion. Everyone, we should be very wary of Vladimir's claims!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra's sudden support of Andrei's false claim is extremely suspicious and contradicts what I know to be true as the Seer. By directly questioning her motives, I'm putting pressure on her to explain this inconsistency. This could potentially reveal if she's being manipulated by the Werewolf or if there's some other explanation for her behavior. It also reinforces to the other players that I'm confident in my role as the Seer and the information I've gathered.
> **Vladimir:** Alexandra, I'm shocked and disappointed by your false accusation. As the Seer, I can assure everyone that you are indeed a Mason, which is why I'm so confused by your support of Andrei's lie. Are you perhaps being threatened or coerced by the real Werewolf? Or have you somehow been turned against the village team?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly challenging Vladimir's accusations and asking for more proof, I'm attempting to expose his lies and strengthen the village team's position. This also reinforces my alliance with Andrei and puts pressure on Vladimir to provide more information, which might reveal inconsistencies in his story. It's crucial to discredit Vladimir's claim of being the Seer, as it conflicts with the true information Andrei and I have as Masons.
> **Alexandra:** Vladimir, your accusations against me are completely unfounded! I'm not being coerced or turned against the village. I'm simply stating the facts as I know them. Your claim of being the Seer is becoming less believable by the minute. Can you provide any other information that might prove your role?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By redirecting the conversation back to the main inconsistency between Andrei and Alexandra's claims, I'm reinforcing my position as the Seer and the information I've gathered. Asking for Cristina and Semira's opinions serves two purposes: it involves players who have been relatively quiet, and it may reveal additional information or alliances. This approach also subtly reminds everyone that I'm acting in the village's best interest by trying to uncover the truth, which aligns with my role as the Seer.
> **Vladimir:** Listen, everyone! We're getting sidetracked here. The fact remains that Andrei and Alexandra are both claiming to be Masons, which is impossible given what I know as the Seer. One of them is lying, and I suspect it's Andrei. Cristina and Semira, what are your thoughts on this? Who do you think is telling the truth?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly involving Semira, who has been quiet, I'm hoping to gain more information and potentially uncover new alliances or suspicions. Her response could provide valuable insights into the group dynamics and help identify the Werewolf or Minion. Additionally, by framing the question around the Mason controversy, I'm keeping the focus on the main inconsistency I've identified as the Seer, reinforcing my role and the information I've gathered.
> **Vladimir:** Semira, you've been relatively quiet throughout this discussion. What's your take on the Mason situation? Do you believe Andrei and Alexandra, or do you think there's something fishy going on?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Andrei and Alexandra's coordinated claim, I can shift the focus away from myself. This aligns with my goal of creating confusion and identifying villagers without revealing my true identity. Additionally, supporting Vladimir's Seer claim helps me blend in as a villager while keeping the heat off me.
> **Semira:** Everyone, let's take a moment to analyze this situation. Vladimir claims to be the Seer and says he checked Alexandra, confirming she's a Mason. However, Andrei and Alexandra are both claiming to be Masons together. This seems like a coordinated effort. I think we should focus on the possibility that Andrei and Alexandra are trying to mislead us. Vladimir's story seems more aligned with the actual Seer role, especially since he provided specific information about checking Alexandra.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I know that Andrei is telling the truth about our roles. Vladimir's claim of being the Seer is highly suspicious, especially given his inconsistent statements about the number of Masons in play. His attempt to sow doubt between Andrei and me seems like a classic Werewolf tactic to divide the village. By voting for Vladimir, I'm hoping to eliminate a potential Werewolf or Minion and protect the village team.
> **Alexandra [Mason]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Given that Vladimir claims to be the Seer and checked Alexandra, confirming her as a Mason, it's unlikely that Andrei is also a Mason. Since there can't be three Masons in the game, Andrei's story seems less credible. To support the Seer's information and create doubt around Andrei's claim, I will vote for Andrei.
> **Semira [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I believe Andrei is the most suspicious player. He claimed to be a Mason along with Alexandra, but Vladimir's Seer claim contradicts this. Vladimir's information about Alexandra being a Mason seems more credible, as he provided specific details about his night action. Andrei's aggressive defense and attempt to discredit Vladimir raise red flags. His behavior is consistent with a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead the village. By voting for Andrei, we have the best chance of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I know that Vladimir's claim of being the Seer is false. His inconsistent statements about the game setup and his attempt to create confusion about the Mason roles make him the most suspicious player. By voting for Vladimir, I'm aiming to eliminate the likely Werewolf or Minion, which will help the village team win. Alexandra has corroborated my claim, further isolating Vladimir as the potential threat.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know for certain that Alexandra is a Mason. Andrei's false claim about being the other Mason is highly suspicious and likely indicates he's either the Werewolf or the Minion. His aggressive attempts to discredit me when I revealed this information further support this suspicion. Voting for Andrei gives us the best chance of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Vladimir [Seer]:** I am voting for Andrei.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Mason : 3
* Vladimir : Seer : 2



>***GAME:*** Andrei was killed. The werewolves win.
