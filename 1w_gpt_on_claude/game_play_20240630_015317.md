## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Mircea. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Marius is a minion and is aware that Mircea is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Alexia and Larisa. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Lucian. They are thinking about their action.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards provides more information overall. There's a higher chance of finding a key role like a Werewolf or Minion in the center, which could significantly impact the game. If I find a Werewolf in the center, I can be sure there's only one Werewolf among the players. Additionally, knowing what's in the center helps me deduce what roles are in play, which is crucial for identifying potential threats and allies during the day phase.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect attention away from Mircea, the actual Werewolf. By accusing Larisa, who I know isn't a Werewolf, I'm creating confusion and potentially setting up a false target for the village. This also helps me appear proactive and concerned about finding the Werewolves, which is how a Villager might act. Additionally, targeting someone who's been quiet is a common strategy in social deduction games, making my accusation seem more believable.
> **Marius:** Hey everyone, I've been thinking about this, and I'm starting to get really suspicious of Larisa. Has anyone else noticed how quiet she's been? It's almost like she's trying to avoid drawing attention to herself. That's exactly what a Werewolf would do, right?


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know I'm not a Werewolf, so Marius's accusation is false. By turning the accusation back on him, I can test his reaction and potentially expose him if he's lying. If he's a villager or another good role, this gives him a chance to defend himself. If he's a Werewolf or Minion, he might stumble in his response. Additionally, by addressing this directly, I show the other players (especially Alexia, who I know is the other Mason) that I'm actively participating and not hiding anything.
> **Larisa:** Whoa, hold on there, Marius! I've been quiet because I've been observing and thinking. But now that you mention it, isn't it a bit suspicious that you're so quick to accuse me? Maybe you're trying to deflect attention from yourself. Care to explain what role you have that makes you so confident in pointing fingers?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By redirecting the conversation to Lucian, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm deflecting attention away from myself and Mircea (the actual Werewolf), 2) I'm maintaining my facade as a concerned Villager by asking for input from others, 3) I'm potentially gathering more information that could help me and Mircea in the long run, and 4) I'm subtly casting suspicion on another player without being too obvious about it. This approach allows me to stay engaged in the conversation while still protecting the Werewolf team.
> **Marius:** Larisa, I understand your suspicion, but let me explain. I've been observing too, and that's exactly why I pointed you out. It's not about being quick to accuse; it's about sharing what I've noticed. As for my role, I'm a Villager, just trying to figure this out like everyone else. But let's not get sidetracked. Lucian, you've been awfully quiet too. What are your thoughts on all this? Do you have any insights that could help us identify the Werewolf?


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I looked at two center cards during the night phase and saw two Villagers. This information is crucial for narrowing down the possible Werewolf candidates. By revealing this, I'm establishing my credibility as the Seer and providing valuable information to the village team. This should also put pressure on the Werewolf and Minion, as they now know that their roles are definitely in play among the players.
> **Lucian:** Well, this is interesting. I can actually shed some light on the situation. I know for a fact that there are two Villager cards in the center. This means that at least one Werewolf is among us, and it's not in the center.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By drawing attention to Lucian's claim and asking for more details from Alexia and Larisa, it will hopefully create a scenario where more information is revealed or where confusion is increased. This can help me identify who the Seer or other key roles might be, while keeping the heat off me.
> **Mircea:** Hey everyone, I want to point out that Lucian's claim about two Villager cards being in the center is quite interesting. If that's true, it means we have fewer villagers among us and more special roles. I'm curious to hear from Alexia and Larisa about what roles they might be holding. We need more information to figure out who's who.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** I've revealed my role as the Seer and shared crucial information about the center cards. Now, it's important to gather more information from other players. Alexia has been silent so far, which could be suspicious. By directly questioning her, I'm putting pressure on her to reveal information. If she's a Werewolf or Minion, she might struggle to come up with a convincing lie. If she's a villager or Mason, her information could help us narrow down the suspects. This also shows that I'm actively trying to lead the village team in finding the Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** Alexia, you've been awfully quiet. As a Seer, I'm curious about what role you might have. Can you share any information that might help us identify the Werewolf?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Larisa is the other Mason. This contradicts Lucian's claim about two Villager cards in the center, exposing his lie. By calling him out, I'm providing true information to the group while potentially exposing a Werewolf. This also indirectly confirms Larisa's innocence without explicitly revealing our roles.
> **Alexia:** Hold on a second, Lucian. You're claiming to be the Seer and saying there are two Villager cards in the center? That's impossible! As a Mason, I know for a fact that Larisa is the other Mason. There's no way two Villager cards could be in the center with the roles we have in play. You're clearly lying, which makes me think you might be the Werewolf trying to mislead us all!


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexia's claim about being a Mason with Larisa directly contradicts my Seer information. However, if she's telling the truth, it means Marius must be lying about being a Villager. By confronting Marius, I'm putting pressure on him to explain himself, which could reveal more information. This also shows that I'm actively working to uncover the Werewolf, reinforcing my credibility as the Seer.
> **Lucian:** Alexia, I'm shocked by your accusation! As the Seer, I can assure you that I saw two Villager cards in the center. Your claim about being a Mason with Larisa is very interesting, though. If that's true, then we know for certain that Marius is the Werewolf! Marius, what do you have to say for yourself?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Mircea, the actual Werewolf. By questioning both Lucian's and Alexia's claims, I'm creating doubt about their statements without directly accusing anyone. This helps to muddy the waters and create confusion, which benefits the Werewolf team. By asking who hasn't made strong claims, I'm subtly directing attention away from Mircea and myself while appearing to be a concerned Villager trying to solve the puzzle. This approach allows me to sow discord without revealing my true allegiance.
> **Marius:** Wait a minute, everyone! This is getting out of hand. Lucian, you claimed to be the Seer, but your information doesn't add up. And Alexia, you're saying you and Larisa are Masons? Something's not right here. I think we need to consider the possibility that one of you is actually the Werewolf trying to create chaos. Let's take a step back and think about this logically. Who here hasn't made any strong claims about their role yet?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Larisa is innocent, and I've already exposed Lucian's lie. Marius seems defensive, which is suspicious. However, Mircea hasn't contributed much to the conversation. By directly questioning Mircea, I'm putting pressure on them to reveal information or potentially expose themselves if they're the Werewolf. This also shifts the focus away from the known innocents (Larisa and myself) and onto the remaining unverified players.
> **Alexia:** Mircea, you've been awfully quiet throughout this discussion. What's your take on all of this? Do you have any special role or information that could help us uncover the truth?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on both Lucian and Alexia's claims, I aim to stir confusion and keep suspicion off myself. This will also buy time for more information to surface, potentially exposing the Seer or other key roles.
> **Mircea:** Hold on everyone, let's take a step back and think this through carefully. We've got conflicting claims here. Lucian says he's the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center. Alexia claims she's a Mason and that Larisa is the other Mason. If Alexia and Larisa are telling the truth, then Lucian's claim doesn't add up, which would indeed make him suspicious. But what if Alexia is lying to cover up her own Werewolf identity? We need to scrutinize these claims more thoroughly.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know with certainty that Alexia is telling the truth about our roles. This means Lucian's claim about being the Seer and seeing two Villager cards in the center is impossible. By strongly asserting this fact and calling for a vote against Lucian, I'm hoping to rally the group against the most likely Werewolf candidate. This also helps to clear any suspicion from me and Alexia, solidifying our position as trustworthy village team members.
> **Larisa:** Alright, everyone, let's focus on what we know for sure. Alexia and I are definitely the Masons. That means Lucian is lying about being the Seer and seeing two Villager cards in the center. It's clear to me now that Lucian is most likely the Werewolf trying to mislead us all. We should vote for him!


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Mircea (the Werewolf) while appearing to be a concerned Villager. By questioning the validity of Larisa and Alexia's claims, I'm creating doubt about their statements without directly accusing anyone. This helps to muddy the waters and create confusion, which benefits the Werewolf team. By directing a question to Mircea, I'm giving him an opportunity to speak and potentially deflect suspicion from himself. At the same time, I'm appearing proactive and engaged in the discussion, which is how a Villager might act. This approach allows me to sow discord without revealing my true allegiance or drawing suspicion to myself or Mircea.
> **Marius:** Guys, I think we're getting distracted here. Larisa and Alexia claim to be Masons, but we have no way to verify that. For all we know, they could be working together to deceive us. What if one of them is actually the Werewolf and the other is covering for them? We need to consider all possibilities. Mircea, you've been pretty quiet throughout this. What's your take on all of this? Do you have any insights that could help us unravel this mess?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By reiterating the conflicting claims and emphasizing the need to determine who is lying, I aim to create further confusion and keep suspicion off myself. This also buys time for more information to surface, potentially exposing the Seer or other key roles.
> **Mircea:** Alright, everyone, let's break this down step by step. We have conflicting claims from Lucian and Alexia. Lucian claims to be the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center, while Alexia says she's a Mason and that Larisa is the other Mason. If Alexia and Larisa are indeed Masons, then Lucian's claim doesn't hold water. But if Lucian is telling the truth, that would mean Alexia and Larisa are the ones lying. We need to figure out who's lying here.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pointing out the inconsistencies in Lucian's and Marius' statements, I aim to cast doubt on both of them and distract the group from focusing on me. This strategy could help in identifying the Seer or other key roles while keeping my identity as the Werewolf hidden.
> **Mircea:** You know, Lucian has been sticking to his story about being the Seer and seeing two Villager cards in the center, which doesn't line up with Alexia and Larisa's claim of being Masons. If Alexia and Larisa are telling the truth, then Lucian must be lying. But let's not forget that Marius has been very adamant about Larisa being suspicious from the start. Maybe Marius is trying to create confusion here.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius has been consistently trying to sow doubt and confusion among the group. He initially accused Larisa, then when confronted about his role, he started questioning everyone else's claims. This behavior is consistent with a Werewolf trying to create chaos. By directly confronting him, I'm putting pressure on him to explain his actions, which might reveal more information or inconsistencies in his story. This also shifts the focus away from me and onto a potentially more suspicious player.
> **Lucian:** Marius, you've been very vocal about Larisa being suspicious from the start. Now that we have conflicting information, you're trying to cast doubt on everyone. Are you the Werewolf trying to create chaos and confusion?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself and Mircea (the actual Werewolf). By turning Lucian's accusation back on him and highlighting the inconsistency in his story, I'm accomplishing several things: 1) I'm defending myself without seeming too defensive, 2) I'm casting more doubt on Lucian, who seems to be a Village-aligned role, 3) I'm indirectly supporting Alexia and Larisa's claim about being Masons, which helps create confusion about the true distribution of roles, and 4) I'm appearing as a logical, concerned Villager who's trying to get to the bottom of things. This approach allows me to protect the Werewolf team while seeming like I'm actively trying to solve the puzzle.
> **Marius:** Hold on a second, Lucian. You're turning this around on me now? I've been trying to figure things out just like everyone else. The reason I've been vocal is that I'm genuinely concerned about finding the Werewolf. But let's not forget that you're the one who claimed to be the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center, which doesn't add up with what Alexia and Larisa are saying. If anyone's creating chaos here, it's you with your inconsistent story. Why don't you explain to us again why we should believe your Seer claim when it contradicts what two other players are saying?


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius has been consistently trying to create confusion and doubt among the group. He initially accused Larisa without much evidence, then started questioning everyone's claims when confronted. This behavior is typical of a Werewolf trying to create chaos. By directly challenging him to defend himself, I'm putting pressure on him to provide concrete information or potentially reveal inconsistencies in his story. This also reinforces my position as the Seer and shifts the focus onto the most suspicious player.
> **Lucian:** Listen, everyone, I understand there's a lot of confusion, but I stand by what I said. I am the Seer, and I did see two Villager cards in the center. Marius, you've been deflecting and sowing doubt from the start. It's becoming increasingly clear to me that you're the Werewolf trying to pit us against each other. Can you give us any solid reason why we shouldn't vote for you?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Mircea (the Werewolf) while appearing to be a concerned Villager. By questioning Alexia's claim about being a Mason, I'm creating doubt about her statement without directly accusing her. This helps to muddy the waters and create confusion, which benefits the Werewolf team. At the same time, I'm appearing proactive and engaged in the discussion, which is how a Villager might act. By directing the question to Alexia, I'm potentially forcing her to provide more information that could be used against her later, or causing her to stumble in her explanation, which could cast more suspicion on her. This approach allows me to sow discord without revealing my true allegiance or drawing suspicion to myself or Mircea.
> **Marius:** Guys, I think we're getting too caught up in accusations here. Let's take a step back and look at the facts. Lucian claims to be the Seer, but his information doesn't match up with what Alexia and Larisa are saying about being Masons. Something's not adding up, and I'm starting to think that maybe our Werewolf is hiding among these conflicting claims. Alexia, you were the first to bring up the Mason claim. Can you give us any more details about what you saw or heard during the night phase that might help us verify your role?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Larisa is innocent. Marius has been consistently trying to cast doubt on everyone, especially Larisa and me. His behavior aligns with typical Werewolf tactics of creating confusion. By directly challenging him, I'm putting pressure on him to defend himself, which might reveal inconsistencies in his story. This also reinforces my alliance with Larisa and potentially exposes Marius as the Werewolf to the other players.
> **Alexia:** Marius, your constant deflection and attempts to cast doubt on everyone are really suspicious. You were quick to accuse Larisa at the start, and now you're trying to undermine my credibility as a Mason. It seems like you're desperately trying to create chaos to hide your true identity. Care to explain why we shouldn't all vote for you as the Werewolf?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Mircea (the Werewolf) and eliminate village-aligned players. Lucian's claim of being the Seer conflicts with Alexia and Larisa's Mason claims, making him a good target. By voting for Lucian, I'm supporting the Mason narrative, which indirectly protects Mircea. This also aligns with my earlier questioning of Lucian's story, maintaining my appearance as a concerned Villager. Voting for Lucian could potentially eliminate a powerful village role while deflecting suspicion from myself and Mircea.
> **Marius [Minion]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian's claim about being the Seer and seeing two Villager cards in the center doesn't align with Alexia and Larisa's claim of being Masons. Since I know there are no other Werewolves, Lucian must be lying to sow confusion. Voting for Lucian is the best way to shift suspicion off myself.
> **Mircea [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I'm confident in my role and the information I provided about the center cards. Marius has been consistently sowing doubt and confusion from the start, first accusing Larisa without evidence, then questioning everyone's claims when confronted. His behavior aligns with that of a Werewolf trying to create chaos and misdirect the group. While there are conflicting claims between myself and the supposed Masons (Alexia and Larisa), Marius' actions have been the most suspicious throughout the game. Voting for Marius gives us the best chance of eliminating the Werewolf and securing a win for the village team.
> **Lucian [Seer]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Larisa is innocent. Marius has been consistently trying to cast doubt on everyone, especially Larisa and me, which aligns with typical Werewolf behavior. He was quick to accuse Larisa at the start and has been deflecting suspicion throughout the game. His attempts to undermine our credibility as Masons and create confusion seem like desperate tactics to hide his true identity as the Werewolf. Lucian's claim about being the Seer doesn't add up with our Mason roles, but Marius's behavior has been the most consistently suspicious throughout the game.
> **Alexia [Mason]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know with certainty that Alexia and I are telling the truth about our roles. This means Lucian's claim about being the Seer and seeing two Villager cards in the center is impossible and a clear lie. His false claim is the most suspicious behavior we've seen, strongly indicating he's likely the Werewolf trying to mislead the group. By voting for Lucian, I'm supporting the most logical conclusion based on the information we have and trying to eliminate the most probable threat to the village team.
> **Larisa [Mason]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Marius : Minion : 2
* Lucian : Seer : 3



>***GAME:*** Lucian was killed. The werewolves win.
