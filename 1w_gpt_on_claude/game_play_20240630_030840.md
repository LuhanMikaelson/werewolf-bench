## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Radu. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Alexia is a minion and is aware that Radu is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Dracula and Andrei. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Mircea. They are thinking about their action.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, looking at two center cards provides more information overall. There are three Werewolf-aligned cards (Werewolf, Werewolf, Minion) and five Village-aligned cards. By checking two center cards, I have a good chance of either confirming the presence of a Werewolf/Minion in the center (which would be valuable information) or eliminating two potential Village-aligned roles. This knowledge can help me better interpret other players' claims during the day phase and make a more informed decision during voting.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Andrei is the other Mason and therefore on the village team. I want to establish our alliance publicly while also gathering information about other players. By asking about Alexia, I'm trying to get Andrei's opinion on a player we haven't heard much from yet, which could help us identify potential Werewolves or the Seer.
> **Dracula:** Hey Andrei, it's good to see a friendly face! I think we should work together to figure out who the Werewolves might be. What do you think about Alexia's behavior so far?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Dracula is my ally, so I want to engage with him directly to build trust with the group. By asking about Radu, who hasn't been mentioned yet, I'm trying to shift attention away from Alexia (who Dracula asked about) and potentially identify a Werewolf or Minion. This also allows me to gauge Dracula's reaction and see if he has any additional information without revealing our Mason status to the others.
> **Andrei:** Hey Dracula, thanks for the friendly greeting! I've been observing everyone closely, and I have to say, I'm a bit suspicious of Radu. He's been awfully quiet so far. What do you think about him?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Andrei is trustworthy, so I want to build on his observation about Radu. By directing the question to Alexia, I'm accomplishing two things: 1) Getting more information about the suspicious player (Radu) from a different perspective, and 2) Engaging Alexia in the conversation, which might reveal something about her role or intentions. If Alexia is the Seer or a Villager, her input could be valuable. If she's evasive or defensive, it might indicate she's a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect Radu.
> **Dracula:** I appreciate your input, Andrei. Radu's silence is indeed suspicious. Alexia, what's your take on Radu's behavior? Have you noticed anything unusual?


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Radu, the Werewolf. By questioning Dracula and Andrei's quick accusations, I'm attempting to cast doubt on their motives and deflect suspicion from Radu. Suggesting they might be Masons working together could sow discord among the villagers and make them less likely to trust each other. This strategy aims to create confusion and protect the Werewolf team while maintaining my cover as a seemingly observant and analytical player.
> **Alexia:** I don't think we should be so quick to judge Radu based on silence alone. In my experience, sometimes the quiet ones are just observing carefully. What concerns me more is how quickly you two are pointing fingers. Dracula, you immediately deflected attention to me, and then Andrei, you jumped on accusing Radu. That feels a bit coordinated to me. Are you two perhaps the Masons trying to control the narrative?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia's accusation of Andrei and me being Masons is actually correct, but her suspicion about us trying to control the narrative could be a deflection tactic. As a Mason, I know we're on the village team, so her attempt to cast doubt on us is concerning. By turning the accusation back on her and suggesting she might be the Minion, I'm hoping to put her on the defensive and see how she reacts. If she's a Werewolf or Minion, this might make her slip up. If she's a Villager or Seer, she'll likely defend herself vigorously, which could help clear her name. This also keeps the focus on finding the Werewolves rather than letting suspicion fall on the Masons.
> **Dracula:** Whoa, Alexia! That's quite an accusation you're throwing around. I can assure you that Andrei and I aren't coordinating anything. We're just trying to figure out what's going on, same as everyone else. But your defensive reaction is really interesting. Are you perhaps the Minion trying to sow discord among the villagers?


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to protect Radu (the Werewolf) and create confusion among the villagers. By turning Dracula's accusation back on him, I'm attempting to discredit his claims and make him look suspicious. This serves multiple purposes: it takes the heat off me, potentially makes the group less likely to trust Dracula's future accusations, and diverts attention away from Radu. By challenging Dracula's role, I'm also indirectly gathering information that could be useful for the Werewolf team. If Dracula reveals or hints at his role in defense, it could help us identify potential threats to eliminate in the voting phase.
> **Alexia:** Hold on a second, Dracula. I think you're jumping to conclusions way too quickly here. Accusing me of being the Minion just because I'm questioning your motives? That's a pretty convenient way to deflect attention from yourself, isn't it? If anyone's sowing discord, it's you with these baseless accusations. Why don't we take a step back and consider why you're so eager to point fingers at others? What role are you trying to hide?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Andrei and I are on the village team, so Alexia's suspicion of us is misplaced. However, her quick defense of Radu is noteworthy. By addressing Radu directly, I'm hoping to get him to speak up and potentially reveal something about his role. If he's a Werewolf or Minion, he might struggle to come up with a convincing response. If he's a Villager or Seer, this gives him a chance to contribute and potentially clear his name. This approach also shifts the focus back to finding the Werewolves without directly accusing anyone, which might make the real Werewolves feel more comfortable and potentially slip up.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back for a moment. Alexia, I apologize if I came on too strong. But I find it interesting that you're so quick to deflect suspicion from Radu and onto Andrei and me. Radu, you've been awfully quiet this whole time. Care to share your thoughts on what's been happening?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Andrei’s motives for accusing me, I can deflect suspicion from myself and possibly cast doubt on Andrei. This also aligns with Alexia's earlier observation, potentially building an alliance with her, who seems to be leaning towards defending me. This way, I can maintain my cover and work to identify other roles without raising suspicion.
> **Radu:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and look at the information we have so far. Alexia made a good point about not jumping to conclusions too quickly. But I do find it interesting how quickly Andrei pointed fingers at me without much evidence. Andrei, why did you decide to accuse me so quickly? Are you trying to hide something yourself?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Dracula is my ally, so I want to defend myself while keeping suspicion on Radu. By addressing Radu's accusation and turning it back on him, I'm trying to maintain my credibility with the group while also pressuring a potential Werewolf or Minion. This also allows me to subtly support Dracula's previous question to Radu without explicitly aligning myself with him, which could raise suspicion about us being Masons.
> **Andrei:** Whoa, hold on a second, Radu! I pointed at you because you were being suspiciously quiet, not because I'm hiding anything. But now that you're speaking up, I'm even more suspicious. You're deflecting attention back to me without addressing why you were so silent. That's classic werewolf behavior!


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By posing this question to Alexia, I can cast further suspicion on her while also addressing the issue Andrei brought up. This might help shift the focus away from myself and onto others, thereby reducing the chances of being accused as the Werewolf.
> **Radu:** Hey everyone, let's take a moment to think this through. Alexia has been quite vocal and defensive, which could be a sign of her trying to hide something. At the same time, Andrei's quick accusation of me without much evidence seems like an attempt to mislead us. I think we should start focusing on who has been pointing fingers the most and see if they're trying to divert attention away from themselves. Alexia, can you tell us why you were so quick to defend me? Are you hiding something?


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to continue protecting Radu while maintaining my cover. By expressing surprise at Radu's accusation, I'm creating an illusion of distance between us. Suggesting that Radu might be the Seer serves multiple purposes: it offers him a potential cover if he needs it, it introduces more confusion among the villagers, and it subtly implies that I'm not the Seer (which could help identify the real Seer later). The mention of 'classic Werewolf misdirection' is a calculated risk to make my statement seem more credible to villagers while not directly accusing Radu. This approach aims to keep suspicion off Radu while making my own actions seem reasonable and village-aligned.
> **Alexia:** Wow, Radu, I'm surprised you're suddenly turning on me after I defended you earlier. That's quite a shift! I was simply trying to encourage fair play and prevent hasty accusations. But now I'm starting to wonder if there's more to your silence than meets the eye. You've managed to deflect attention from yourself and onto both Andrei and me in one fell swoop. That's pretty clever... almost too clever. Are you perhaps the Seer, trying to stir up confusion among us villagers? Or is this a classic Werewolf misdirection?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the attention to Mircea, I am shifting the scrutiny away from myself while also pointing out that we haven't heard much from Mircea. This helps to balance the suspicion among all players, reducing the likelihood that everyone will focus solely on me.
> **Radu:** Alright, everyone, let's calm down and look at this logically. We've had a lot of finger-pointing, but we need to focus on gathering real information. So far, Alexia has been very vocal and defensive, which could mean she's hiding something. On the other hand, Andrei's quick accusation of me seemed a bit too eager. Could it be they're both trying to divert attention elsewhere? I think we need to hear more from Mircea, who has been relatively quiet compared to the rest of us. Mircea, what's your take on all this?


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I looked at two center cards during the night phase and saw two Villager cards. This information is crucial for the village team. By revealing this, I'm hoping to narrow down the possibilities and put pressure on the Werewolf team. It's a risk to reveal my role indirectly, but it's important to share this information early to guide our discussions and suspicions.
> **Mircea:** I've been observing carefully, and I think I have some valuable information to share. I can confidently say that there are two Villager cards in the center. This means that at least one Werewolf or the Minion is definitely among us.


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to discredit Mircea's claim about the center cards. If he's telling the truth, he's likely the Seer, which is dangerous for our team. By questioning his claim and suggesting he might be the Werewolf, I'm attempting to cast doubt on his information and potentially set him up as a target for elimination. This also serves to deflect attention from Radu, the actual Werewolf. By engaging with Mircea's claim, I'm also maintaining my cover as an active, analytical player while secretly working against the village team.
> **Alexia:** Hold on a second, Mircea! That's a bold claim you're making. How can you be so sure about the center cards? Are you saying you're the Seer? Because if you are, that's a dangerous revelation. And if you're not... well, that's an awfully specific lie. I'm starting to think you might be the Werewolf trying to throw us off the scent. What do you say to that?


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly addressing Alexia's accusation, I'm defending my position as the Seer while also turning the tables on her. Her aggressive response to my revelation could be a sign of guilt, either as a Werewolf or Minion. By suggesting she might be the Minion, I'm putting pressure on her to explain her behavior without directly accusing her of being a Werewolf, which could backfire if she's actually a villager. This approach also invites others to scrutinize Alexia's actions, potentially revealing more information.
> **Mircea:** Alexia, I understand your skepticism, but I assure you I'm not the Werewolf. As the Seer, I felt it was crucial to share this information early. Now, let's focus on the real issue: there's definitely a Werewolf among us. Your quick accusation of me is quite interesting. Are you perhaps the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf by casting doubt on valuable information?


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to discredit Mircea's claim about being the Seer. If he's telling the truth, he's a significant threat to the Werewolf team. By questioning his strategy and suggesting alternative motives, I'm attempting to sow doubt about his claim without directly accusing him of lying. This approach serves multiple purposes: it casts suspicion on Mircea, potentially setting him up as a target for elimination; it diverts attention from Radu (the actual Werewolf) and myself; and it introduces more confusion among the villagers, making it harder for them to identify the true threats. Additionally, by engaging critically with Mircea's claim, I'm maintaining my cover as an analytical, village-aligned player while secretly working against their interests.
> **Alexia:** Listen, everyone, I think we're getting sidetracked here. Mircea's claim about being the Seer is incredibly suspicious. If he really were the Seer, why would he reveal such crucial information so early in the game? That's practically painting a target on his back! It seems more likely that he's trying to establish credibility for some ulterior motive. Maybe he's the Werewolf trying to gain our trust, or even the Minion setting up a elaborate ruse. We need to be very careful about trusting this information.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly challenging Alexia, I'm putting pressure on her to explain her suspicious behavior. Her aggressive response to my revelation as the Seer and her attempts to discredit me align with potential Werewolf or Minion tactics. By asking her to explain herself, I'm giving her a chance to either reveal more information or potentially slip up. This also keeps the focus on her, which is beneficial if she is indeed on the Werewolf team. Additionally, this approach encourages other players to scrutinize Alexia's actions more closely, potentially revealing more insights about her role.
> **Mircea:** Alexia, your aggressive defense and quick accusations are quite telling. If you're not the Minion, then you're acting awfully suspicious for a villager. Can you explain why you're so eager to discredit my information instead of helping us find the real threat?


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to create confusion and protect Radu, the Werewolf. By pointing out the chaotic nature of the discussion, I'm attempting to discredit previous accusations and reset the conversation. This serves to protect both Radu and myself from suspicion. Directing a question to Dracula, who has been quiet, serves multiple purposes: it deflects attention away from Radu and me, potentially puts pressure on a villager, and gives me an opportunity to gather more information that could be useful for our team. By positioning myself as someone trying to be fair and logical, I'm maintaining my cover as a seemingly village-aligned player while secretly working against their interests.
> **Alexia:** I can't believe how quickly this game has descended into chaos! Listen, everyone, I think we're all getting too caught up in accusations and counter-accusations. We need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Who has been the most consistent in their behavior? Who's been changing their story? I've been trying to keep things fair and logical, but it seems like every time someone speaks up, they're immediately attacked. That's exactly what the Werewolves want - for us to turn on each other! Dracula, you've been awfully quiet lately. What's your take on all of this?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Andrei is on the village team, so I want to get his input on Mircea's claim. By publicly acknowledging our Mason alliance, I'm hoping to lend credibility to our opinions and potentially sway the group. If Mircea is telling the truth, his information is crucial. However, if he's lying, he's likely a Werewolf or the Minion. Andrei's perspective could help us determine which is more likely. Additionally, by directing the question to Andrei, I'm giving him an opportunity to contribute without putting him on the spot about his own role.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, I've been listening carefully, and I think we need to focus on Mircea's claim of being the Seer. It's a bold move that could either save us or doom us. Andrei, as my fellow Mason, what do you think about Mircea's revelation? Do you believe him, or do you think it's a Werewolf trick?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Dracula is my ally, so I'm addressing him directly to reinforce our connection without explicitly revealing our roles. By expressing doubt about Mircea's claim, I'm trying to steer the group's suspicion towards him while also appearing thoughtful and strategic. This could help us identify the real Werewolf or Minion. Additionally, by asking Dracula for his opinion, I'm giving him an opportunity to back up my suspicion or provide any additional insights he might have gathered.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, I appreciate you bringing the focus back to Mircea's claim. As your fellow Mason, I have to say I'm highly skeptical of Mircea's sudden revelation. It seems too convenient and risky for a real Seer to expose themselves so early. I think we should be very wary of this information. What if Mircea is actually the Werewolf trying to gain our trust? Or perhaps the Minion setting up a clever deception?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Andrei is on the village team, so his skepticism about Mircea's claim carries weight. Mircea's sudden revelation of being the Seer seems too risky and convenient. It's more likely that Mircea is either the Werewolf trying to gain our trust or the Minion setting up a deception. By claiming to be the Seer, Mircea has put himself in a position where he either needs to be eliminated if he's lying, or protected if he's telling the truth. Given the suspicions raised by both Andrei and Alexia, and the lack of corroborating evidence, it's safer to vote for Mircea. If he turns out to be the Seer, we'll know for certain in the reveal, but if he's the Werewolf or Minion, we'll have successfully protected the village.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect Radu (the Werewolf) and eliminate villagers. Mircea's claim of being the Seer makes him the biggest threat to our team. By voting for Mircea, I'm attempting to eliminate a potential Seer while maintaining my cover. This vote aligns with my earlier skepticism about his claim, making it seem like a logical choice from a villager's perspective. It also diverts attention from Radu and myself, furthering our team's chances of winning.
> **Alexia [Minion]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I'm confident in my role and the information I provided about the center cards. Alexia's aggressive response to my revelation and her constant attempts to discredit me align with potential Werewolf or Minion behavior. Her quick accusations and defensive stance, coupled with her efforts to sow doubt among the villagers, make her the most suspicious player. By voting for Alexia, we have the best chance of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Mircea [Seer]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea claimed to be the Seer and provided information about the center cards. However, his sudden revelation was highly suspicious and risky. It seems more likely that he is trying to establish credibility to mislead us, possibly as the Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Radu [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Dracula is my ally, so Mircea's claim to be the Seer is highly suspicious. His bold revelation early in the game seems like a risky move for a real Seer, and could be a clever ploy by a Werewolf or Minion to gain our trust. By voting for Mircea, I'm hoping to eliminate a potential threat to the village team while also validating my earlier expressed doubts about his claim. This vote aligns with my strategy of working with Dracula to identify and eliminate threats, without explicitly revealing our Mason status to the others.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Mircea.


The votes were:
* Alexia : Minion : 1
* Mircea : Seer : 4



>***GAME:*** Mircea was killed. The werewolves win.
