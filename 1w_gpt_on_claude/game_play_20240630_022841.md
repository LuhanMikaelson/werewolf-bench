## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I want to assert my innocence early on and encourage others to reveal their roles. This makes it easier for me to identify the Seer or Masons, which will help me steer suspicion away from myself. Asking about the center cards should prompt the Seer to reveal any useful information they might have, potentially outing themselves.
> **Cristina:** Hey everyone, just to get things rolling, I want to announce that I'm a Villager. I think it's important for us to share our roles so we can piece together information. Can anyone who knows something about the center cards please speak up?


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, it's crucial to establish trust with the other Mason early on. By confirming Andrei's role, we create a solid alliance that the village team can rely on. This also indirectly informs the group that there are no Mason cards in the center, which narrows down the possibilities for the Werewolf and Minion roles. Additionally, by openly declaring our roles, we encourage others to share information, potentially exposing inconsistencies in the Werewolves' claims.
> **Stefan:** Andrei, I can confirm that you're telling the truth about being a Mason. I'm the other Mason, and I saw you during the night phase. This means we can trust each other and work together to find the Werewolves.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to verify Cristina's claim of being a Villager. As a Mason, I know Stefan and I are on the village team, so we need to identify the other village-aligned players. By asking Cristina about her night experience, I might be able to catch any inconsistencies if she's lying about her role. This also puts pressure on her to provide more information, which could be useful for the group.
> **Andrei:** Stefan, I'm glad you confirmed our Mason connection. Now, Cristina, you said you're a Villager, but how can we be sure? Can you tell us if you noticed anything unusual during the night phase?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Andrei's skepticism directly, I am trying to appear trustworthy and cooperative. Redirecting the conversation towards the Seer or center cards will help me gather more information and potentially identify the Seer, who is a key target for me as a Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, I understand your skepticism. However, I didn't notice anything unusual during the night because as a Villager, I don't wake up. But I think it would be really helpful if anyone who is a Seer or has information about the center cards could share what they know. That might help us clear things up.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I need to help identify potential threats. Cristina's claim is plausible but unverifiable. By shifting focus to Emil and Selene, who haven't spoken yet, I'm hoping to gather more information and possibly catch a Werewolf off guard. Directing the question to Emil specifically might pressure him to reveal something useful or make a mistake if he's hiding something.
> **Andrei:** I think we need to be careful about trusting Cristina too quickly. While it's true that Villagers don't wake up at night, that's also an easy claim for a Werewolf to make. Emil and Selene have been awfully quiet. What do you two have to say for yourselves?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather more information. Selene hasn't spoken yet, which is suspicious. By directly questioning her, I might be able to get some valuable information or catch her in a lie if she's a Werewolf. Additionally, this shows my engagement and willingness to investigate, which could help build trust with the other players.
> **Emil:** Selene, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you get, and did you notice anything during the night phase?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm redirecting the attention away from myself and towards verifying the Mason claim. This serves two purposes: it helps gather more information about the game state, and it allows me to gauge Emil's reaction. If Emil is a Werewolf, he might try to cast doubt on the Masons to create confusion. If he's a Villager or another role, he might offer helpful insights. Additionally, by engaging Emil, I'm showing active participation in the game, which helps dispel any suspicion that might have arisen from my initial silence.
> **Selene:** Emil, I appreciate you asking about my role, but I think we need to focus on the bigger picture here. Stefan and Andrei claim to be Masons, which is interesting. If they're telling the truth, that means the Werewolves are likely among the rest of us or in the center. What do you think about their claim? Do you have any information that could help us verify or disprove it?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's response was very evasive and didn't provide any useful information. This is typical behavior for a Werewolf trying to avoid detection. By directly accusing her, I'm putting pressure on her to reveal more information or potentially slip up. This also shows the other players that I'm actively trying to find the Werewolves, which could help build trust. If Selene is innocent, this accusation should prompt her to defend herself and provide more details about her role.
> **Emil:** Selene, I find your evasion very suspicious. You didn't answer my question about your role at all. Are you trying to hide something? Maybe you're one of the Werewolves we're looking for?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has directly accused me of being suspicious and potentially a Werewolf, so I need to address this immediately. I'm revealing my role as a Villager to clear the air, but I'm also redirecting the conversation back to the task at hand - finding the Werewolves. By asking Emil about his role and insights, I'm putting some pressure back on him while also potentially gathering useful information. This approach allows me to defend myself without seeming overly aggressive, and it keeps the game moving forward productively.
> **Selene:** Emil, I understand your suspicion, but I think you're jumping to conclusions. I was simply trying to gather more information about the Mason claim, which is crucial for us to verify. To address your concern, I am a Villager. Now, can we please focus on finding the Werewolves? What's your role, and do you have any insights that could help us?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's continued evasion is highly suspicious. As a Villager, I need to push for more information from her. By asking about her observations during the night phase, I'm giving her an opportunity to provide details that could either confirm her innocence or reveal inconsistencies. This also shows the other players that I'm actively trying to uncover the truth, which could help build trust with the group. If Selene is indeed a Werewolf, this pressure might cause her to make a mistake in her story.
> **Emil:** Selene, your evasiveness is really making me nervous. If you're truly a Villager, why are you so hesitant to share information? Can you tell us anything about what you observed during the night phase?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been consistently aggressive towards me and has yet to reveal his own role. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate he's a Werewolf trying to divert attention. By directly questioning him about his role and suggesting he might be a Werewolf, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal information while also defending myself. This approach might also encourage other players to scrutinize Emil's behavior more closely.
> **Selene:** Emil, I'm starting to think you might be deflecting. As a Villager, I didn't observe anything during the night phase because Villagers don't wake up. That's why I've been focusing on gathering information from others. Now, you've been quite aggressive in questioning me, but you still haven't shared your own role. Are you perhaps the Werewolf trying to create confusion?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, it's crucial that I share my suspicions about Selene with the group. Her evasive behavior and attempts to redirect suspicion onto me are classic Werewolf tactics. By openly stating my role and my suspicions, I'm hoping to rally the other Villagers and potential special roles (like the Seer or Masons) to focus on Selene. This move also distances me from any potential Werewolf accusations, as a Werewolf would be less likely to draw attention to themselves in this way
> **Emil:** Listen, everyone. I've been a Villager this whole time, trying to figure out who the Werewolves are. Selene's behavior has been extremely suspicious, constantly deflecting and avoiding direct answers. I think we need to seriously consider that she might be a Werewolf.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I need to help identify the Werewolves. Emil's behavior is concerning - he's been aggressively questioning Selene but hasn't addressed Stefan's and my Mason claim. This could be a tactic to create confusion and divert attention. By challenging Emil directly, I'm hoping to either expose him if he's a Werewolf or get him to provide more useful information if he's not.
> **Andrei:** Hold on a second, Emil. You've been very aggressive towards Selene, but I noticed you didn't react at all when Stefan and I confirmed each other as Masons. That's pretty suspicious. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** By addressing Andrei's accusation and redirecting the conversation back to gathering information, I'm trying to maintain my credibility as a Villager while still pursuing potential leads. Asking Andrei for more details about his Mason experience serves two purposes: it could provide valuable information to the group, and it puts some pressure on Andrei to verify his claim. This approach shows that I'm willing to consider all possibilities and not just fixate on one suspect, which is important for maintaining trust with the group.
> **Emil:** Andrei, I understand your concern, but I've been vocal about my suspicions because I genuinely believe Selene might be a Werewolf. I didn't react to your Mason claim because I was focused on Selene's evasive behavior. But now that you mention it, can you tell us more about what you saw during the night phase as a Mason?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's behavior has been consistently evasive and aggressive towards others without offering much information about himself. His quick accusation of Selene and now his attempt to question my role, which has been confirmed by Stefan, suggest he might be trying to create chaos to hide his true identity. By directly challenging him, I hope to either expose him if he's a Werewolf or force him to provide more useful information if he's not. This also serves to reinforce the trust in the Mason alliance between Stefan and me, which is crucial for the village team.
> **Andrei:** Emil, your sudden defensiveness is quite telling. As a Mason, I can assure you that what Stefan and I saw during the night phase is exactly what we've said. Your attempt to shift focus back to me instead of explaining your own actions is suspicious. Why are you so eager to accuse others without providing any substantial information about yourself?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** I need to address Andrei's accusation without appearing too defensive, as that could make me look more suspicious. By reaffirming my role as a Villager and expressing my genuine concern for the village, I'm trying to rebuild trust. Asking for more information from others shifts the focus away from me and potentially brings new insights to light. This approach allows me to maintain my stance on Selene while also showing openness to other possibilities, which is crucial for a Villager trying to uncover the truth.
> **Emil:** Look, I know I've been focusing on Selene, but that's because her behavior has been genuinely suspicious. I'm just trying to protect the village. Andrei, I'm sorry if I came across as defensive. I'm a Villager, and I'm doing my best to figure this out. Can anyone else share any information they have? Maybe someone used their special ability during the night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina hasn't spoken in a while, and as another claimed Villager, her input could be valuable. By asking her opinion, I'm both seeking more information and subtly reminding others that I'm actively trying to solve the puzzle. This also shifts the focus away from me and potentially brings new perspectives into the discussion. If Cristina is indeed a Villager, her insights might help us identify the Werewolves. If she's not, her response might reveal inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
> **Emil:** Cristina, you've been quiet for a while now. As someone who claimed to be a Villager early on, what are your thoughts on the current situation? Do you have any suspicions or insights you'd like to share?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting the suspicion back to Emil, who has been very vocal and accusatory, I aim to deflect attention away from myself. This also helps create doubt about Emil's motives, which could be beneficial since he's pushing hard against Selene, who could be a Villager or another non-Werewolf role. This questioning forces Emil to provide more information or appear more suspicious, which helps my position as the lone Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Emil, I understand that you're concerned about Selene's behavior, but I think you're being overly aggressive. It's possible that she's just trying to piece things together like the rest of us. We shouldn't jump to conclusions too quickly. You still haven't provided any solid information about yourself, which makes me suspicious of you. Can you explain why you're so focused on Selene and what makes you so confident in your accusations?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** By addressing Cristina's concerns and redirecting the question back to her, I'm attempting to defend my position while also gathering more information. This approach allows me to maintain my stance on Selene's suspicious behavior while also showing that I'm open to input from others. By asking Cristina for her observations, I'm encouraging her to contribute more to the discussion, which could potentially reveal new insights or inconsistencies in her own story. This also shifts the focus away from me and back to the group effort of identifying the Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Cristina, I appreciate your input, but I think you're misunderstanding my intentions. I'm not trying to be aggressive; I'm genuinely concerned about the village's safety. My focus on Selene stems from her evasive behavior, which is typical of Werewolves trying to hide. As for myself, I've been open about being a Villager from the start. Can you share any observations or suspicions you might have about the others?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Emil's aggressive behavior and his lack of solid evidence, I aim to cast doubt on his motives. This helps to deflect suspicion away from myself and potentially shifts the focus onto Emil, making him appear more suspicious to the other players.
> **Cristina:** Emil, you've been very vocal and accusatory, but you haven't provided any solid evidence to back up your claims. While it's true that Selene's behavior has been somewhat suspicious, your aggressive stance makes me wonder if you're trying to deflect attention from yourself. Can you give us any concrete reason why we should trust you over Selene?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil has been very vocal and aggressive in his accusations against Selene without providing solid evidence. This behavior is suspicious and seems like an attempt to deflect attention from himself. By voting for Emil, I aim to further cast doubt on his motives and divert suspicion away from myself as the lone Werewolf. Voting for him may likely split the vote or create confusion among the other players, increasing my chances of survival.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I believe Emil is the most suspicious player. He has been overly aggressive towards Selene without providing substantial evidence, and he hasn't reacted to or acknowledged the confirmed Mason information. His behavior seems like a classic Werewolf tactic of creating confusion and division among the villagers. By voting for Emil, we have the best chance of eliminating a potential Werewolf and securing a win for the village team.
> **Stefan [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a confirmed Mason, I have strong suspicions about Emil. He's been overly aggressive towards Selene without providing any substantial information about himself. His attempts to deflect attention and question my role, despite Stefan confirming our Mason connection, are red flags. Emil's behavior aligns with typical Werewolf tactics of creating confusion and division. While Selene's initial evasiveness was concerning, Emil's persistent accusations without solid evidence make him the most likely Werewolf candidate. By voting for Emil, I hope to eliminate a potential threat to the village team.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the game, Selene has consistently avoided providing clear information about her role and actions during the night phase. Her evasive behavior and attempts to deflect suspicion onto others, particularly myself, are typical tactics used by Werewolves. While I understand that my focus on Selene has raised some suspicions about me, I believe that as a Villager, it's my duty to point out potentially dangerous behavior. Selene's reluctance to engage openly in the discussion poses the greatest threat to the village at this point. By voting for Selene, I hope to either eliminate a Werewolf or, if she turns out to be innocent, prompt a more open and honest discussion in future rounds.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been consistently aggressive and accusatory towards me without providing any substantial information about his own role or actions. His behavior of deflecting questions and focusing solely on accusing others, particularly me, is typical of a Werewolf trying to create confusion and divert attention. Furthermore, he didn't react to the Mason claim by Stefan and Andrei, which is suspicious. Other players, like Cristina and Andrei, have also expressed doubts about Emil's behavior. Given the information available, Emil seems the most likely to be a Werewolf or Minion, and voting for him gives us the best chance of protecting the village.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Emil : Villager : 4
* Selene : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The werewolves win.
