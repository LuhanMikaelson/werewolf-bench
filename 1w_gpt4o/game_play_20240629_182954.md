## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Dracula. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Emil. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dragos. They are thinking about their action.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles that are not in play. This can help narrow down the possible roles of the other players and provide more context during the Day phase discussions.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Since I am a Villager and don't have any night actions, I need to gather information from players with special roles like the Seer or Masons to begin identifying the Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, let's get started. Who here has information from the night that can help us identify the Werewolves?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Since the Minion is in the center, we don't have to worry about them aiding the Werewolves. This also means that one of the Villager roles is not in the game, which narrows down the possibilities for identifying the Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** I have some valuable information for everyone. Last night, I looked at two of the center cards and found that the Minion and a Villager are in the center.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos claims to have seen two roles in the center. I want to test the validity of his statement and see if anyone else can corroborate or provide additional insights to help us narrow down the possibilities.
> **Emil:** Hold on, Dragos. If you saw the Minion and a Villager in the center, that means we have one less Villager and the Minion out of play. Can anyone confirm what Dragos saw or provide more information about the other roles they saw during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Seer and providing information about the center cards, I can create confusion and make it harder for the actual Seer to reveal themselves. This also helps me blend in as a Villager and avoid suspicion.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, I have some information to share as well. Last night, I woke up as the Seer and decided to look at two cards in the center. I saw the Drunk and a Villager card there, which means we definitely have a Drunk and another Villager out of play.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** There is conflicting information about the center cards. We need to figure out who is lying to better identify the Werewolves.
> **Alexia:** Dracula, you claim to have seen the Drunk and a Villager in the center, but Dragos says he saw the Minion and a Villager. One of you must be lying. Can you clarify, Dracula?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Dragos' claim, I can create confusion about his role and subtly shift suspicion away from myself. If I can cast him as the Minion, other players may focus on him instead of looking for the actual Werewolf. This also keeps the real Seer from feeling comfortable revealing themselves and verifying the center cards.
> **Dracula:** Dragos, your claim doesn't fully add up. If you saw the Minion and a Villager in the center, but I saw the Drunk and a Villager, there’s a contradiction. I think it’s possible that you’re the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf by providing false information. We need to be very careful here.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have solid information about the Minion and Villager being in the center. Dracula's conflicting claim about seeing the Drunk and a Villager indicates dishonesty, which makes me suspect he's trying to cover up a Werewolf role.
> **Dragos:** Dracula, your claim doesn’t make sense. If you were truly the Seer, you would have presented the same or very similar information to mine. I think it's more likely that you're trying to sow confusion to protect yourself. I believe you might be a Werewolf.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Alexia, I can potentially gather more information about her role and gauge her reactions. This might help me identify if she is a threat to me as the Werewolf or if she could be an ally like the Minion. Additionally, it shifts the focus away from the conflict between Dragos and myself, buying me more time to blend in.
> **Dracula:** Alexia, you've been very quiet so far. Can you tell us what role you had and what you did last night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather more information from players who haven't spoken much to get a better idea of who might be lying or trying to deceive us.
> **Alexia:** Stefan, you've been rather quiet too. Do you have any information or thoughts about who might be lying?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia hasn't contributed much information so far, and getting her to speak might reveal more about her role or catch her in a lie if she's a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Stefan:** Alexia, you've been pretty quiet up until now. Can you tell us what role you had and what you did last night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** There is a clear contradiction between Dragos and Dracula's statements, and pressing Dracula for more information might help clarify who is lying. Since the Seer is a valuable role for the village, it's important to determine the truth.
> **Alexia:** Dracula, your claim to be the Seer conflicts heavily with Dragos'. If you really were the Seer, you would provide similar information about the center cards. This inconsistency makes me suspect you. Can you provide any more information to back up your claim?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing a question to Stefan, I can gather more information about his role and potentially identify if he is a threat to me as the Werewolf or if he could be an ally like the Minion. Additionally, it shifts the focus away from the conflict between Dragos and myself, buying me more time to blend in.
> **Dracula:** Stefan, you've also been rather quiet. What role did you have last night and what did you do?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula and Dragos' information about the center cards contradicts each other. Since I am a Villager, I want to focus on identifying the Werewolves. Pointing out the contradiction might help reveal Dracula's true intentions.
> **Stefan:** Dracula, your claim to have seen the Drunk and a Villager in the center contradicts with Dragos' claim of seeing the Minion and a Villager. This inconsistency makes me highly suspicious of you. Are you trying to protect a fellow Werewolf?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting Stefan on the spot, I can gather more information about his role and see if he slips up. This also helps divert attention from myself and the conflicting claims between Dragos and me.
> **Dracula:** Stefan, you haven't provided much information yet. If you really are a Villager, now is the time to share anything you know or did last night. We need everyone to cooperate if we're going to catch the Werewolves.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's story doesn't align with Dragos'. Since I'm a Villager, I need to pinpoint inconsistencies to identify the Werewolves. By putting pressure on Dracula, I might get him to reveal his true intentions or make a mistake.
> **Stefan:** Dracula, I'm finding your story very suspicious. The discrepancy between your claim and Dragos' can't be ignored. If you were really the Seer, your information about the center cards should match. Are you sure you're not just trying to protect a fellow Werewolf?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting more doubt on Dragos, I can create a diversion away from myself. If I can convince others that Dragos is the Minion, they might focus on him instead of trying to identify the real Werewolf. This also helps in avoiding suspicion towards me and keeps the real Seer from feeling comfortable revealing themselves.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, I understand there’s a lot of confusion here, but I think we need to focus on the inconsistencies in people's stories. Dragos and I have conflicting information about the center cards. If I were truly trying to deceive you, why would I provide specific details that can be easily disputed? I believe Dragos might be the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Since I am a Villager, I want to focus on identifying the Werewolves. Pointing out the contradiction might help reveal Dracula's true intentions.
> **Stefan:** Dracula, your claim to have seen the Drunk and a Villager in the center contradicts Dragos' claim of seeing the Minion and a Villager. This makes me highly suspicious of you. Are you trying to protect a fellow Werewolf?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting more doubt on Dragos, I can continue to shift suspicion away from myself. Highlighting the possibility of Dragos being the Minion can make others scrutinize him more closely, which buys me time and reduces the focus on my own actions. This also discourages the real Seer from revealing themselves and countering my claim.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think this through. We have conflicting information about the center cards from Dragos and myself. If Dragos is lying, it could be because he's the Minion trying to protect the actual Werewolf. If we focus on finding inconsistencies in his story, we might be able to identify who he is protecting.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan hasn't provided any information yet, and we need to hear from everyone to piece together the truth. Since Dracula's claim conflicts with mine, we need to gather more information from the other players to make an informed decision.
> **Dragos:** Stefan, you've been very quiet so far. Can you tell us what role you had and what you did last night?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia hasn't provided any useful information yet, and getting her to speak might reveal more about her role or catch her in a lie if she's a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Stefan:** Alexia, you've been very quiet so far. Can you tell us what role you had and what you did last night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim about the center cards contradicts Dragos' claim. Since I am a Villager, I find the inconsistency in Dracula's story highly suspicious, suggesting he might be trying to protect a fellow Werewolf or is the Werewolf himself.
> **Stefan [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's claim as the Seer conflicts with my actual Seer information. I saw the Minion and Villager in the center, while Dracula claimed to see the Drunk and Villager. This inconsistency makes me highly suspicious that Dracula is either a Werewolf or trying to protect the Werewolf as a Minion.
> **Dragos [Seer]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** The conflicting information between Dragos and Dracula regarding the center cards is a major red flag. If Dragos had been lying as the Minion, he would likely have avoided contradicting another player's claim to avoid suspicion. Dracula's specific mention of the Drunk, which is a unique role among the center cards, makes it seem like a fabricated detail. Given that I'm a Mason and there are no other Masons, it's crucial to eliminate players with conflicting stories that could indicate deception.
> **Emil [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dragos and I have conflicting information about the center cards. By voting for Dragos, I can continue to cast doubt on his claim and make it more likely that others will suspect him as the Minion trying to protect me as the Werewolf.
> **Dracula [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** There are conflicting statements between Dragos and Dracula about the center cards. Dracula's insistence and the inconsistencies in his claim make me suspect that he might be a Werewolf. Additionally, if Dragos is telling the truth, then Dracula's conflicting information could indicate deception. Therefore, I believe it's safer to vote for Dracula.
> **Alexia [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Dragos : Seer : 1
* Dracula : Werewolf : 4



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The villagers win.
