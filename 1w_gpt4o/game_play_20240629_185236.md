## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Mircea is on my side, and I want to help gather information from those who had night actions to identify the Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's get things started. I think it's crucial to hear from those who had night actions, especially the Seer. Did anyone get to look at any cards in the center or another player's card?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I'm positioning myself as a non-threat and encouraging others to share their information. This helps me gather clues without drawing suspicion.
> **Lucian:** Alright, we need to get to the bottom of this. I'm a Villager, so I didn't have any special actions last night. But Dragos makes a good point—we need to hear from those who had night actions. Did anyone get a clear look at any cards? Maybe the Seer has some critical information?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's claim of being a Villager isn't very useful without more information. By pressing him for additional details, we might be able to catch inconsistencies in his story if he's lying.
> **Dracula:** Lucian, you claim to be a Villager, but we all know that anyone can claim that role. I'm curious if you have any additional information that could help us.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pushing for the Masons to reveal themselves, I can gather more information about who might be trustworthy. This also shifts the focus away from me and potentially onto others, buying me more time to figure out who the Seer and other crucial roles might be.
> **Lucian:** Dracula, I understand your skepticism. Look, I get it—anyone can claim to be a Villager. But from my perspective, I think it's crucial that we hear from the Masons. They can confirm each other's roles, which would help us narrow down potential threats. Did any Masons wake up last night and can confirm each other?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to establish some confirmed roles to start narrowing down potential Werewolves. If the Masons can confirm each other, it will help us eliminate two suspects right away and focus on the remaining players.
> **Dracula:** Alright, we've heard from Lucian claiming to be a Villager. Since that doesn't give us much to go on, I'd like to push for more concrete information. If there are any Masons out there who can confirm each other, it would help us narrow down our suspects. Can any Masons come forward and confirm their roles?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Dragos and I are Masons, it confirms both of our roles. Lucian's suggestion to confirm the Masons seems genuine, but I want to make sure he is not deflecting suspicion. His reasoning might provide more insights into his alignment.
> **Mircea:** As a Mason, I can confirm Dragos is also a Mason. This should help us narrow things down. Now, Lucian, you claimed to be a Villager. Can you explain why you think confirming the Masons would help us? Do you have any other useful information?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Vladimir, I aim to divert suspicion away from myself while gathering more information about his role. This could help me identify who the Seer might be or at least cast doubt on someone else.
> **Lucian:** Mircea, you claim to be a Mason and have confirmed Dragos as another Mason. This is valuable information. But, there's still a lot we need to uncover. I've been mulling things over, and I think it's time we put some pressure on Vladimir. Vladimir, you haven't said much yet. What role are you claiming to be? We need to hear from everyone to piece this puzzle together.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been pushing the conversation towards revealing the Masons, which could be a diversion tactic. By questioning Lucian, we can gauge his reaction and potentially uncover inconsistencies in his story.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, Lucian, you've been quite vocal about being a Villager and pushing for information about the Masons. But something feels off. Why are you so eager for the Masons to confirm each other? Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly addressing Vladimir and asking for his role and any information, I can gather more clues and possibly shift suspicion away from myself. This also gives me a chance to see how Vladimir responds, which could help me identify his role or cast doubt on him if he appears suspicious.
> **Lucian:** Vladimir, I understand your concern about why I pushed for the Masons to confirm each other. The reason is simple: having confirmed Masons means we can trust their information, which narrows down the pool of suspects. Now, you're putting me on the spot, but I think it's time we hear more from you. What role are you claiming to be? And if you have any information from the night, now's the time to share it.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** By reiterating the claims already made and casting some doubt on Lucian's intentions, we can keep the discussion moving forward and see if there are any inconsistencies in his story. Lucian's insistence on confirming the Masons might be a tactic to deflect suspicion.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, let's get focused. So far, we've heard some claims but no solid evidence. Mircea claims to be a Mason and has confirmed Dragos. This seems like trustworthy information, but I'm still wary. Lucian has been pushing for Mason confirmation, which seems a bit suspicious to me.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been pushing for information in a way that feels like a diversion tactic. By putting pressure on him and seeing his reaction, we might uncover inconsistencies in his story or even get closer to identifying a Werewolf.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, it's time to get serious. Lucian, you've been very vocal about being a Villager and pushing for Mason confirmation. But something feels off about your eagerness. Could you be trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Dracula, I can divert suspicion away from myself while gathering more information about his role. This also helps me identify if Dracula might be a Seer or another important role, which could help me decide who to target during the vote.
> **Lucian:** Vladimir, I see you're quite suspicious of me, but I think it's time to turn our attention to Dracula. You've been relatively quiet and haven't given much information about your role. Dracula, can you tell us what role you are claiming and if you have any useful information from last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's suspicious behavior and lack of concrete information makes him a prime target for questioning. We need to understand his role and intentions better to get a clearer picture of who might be the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Vladimir, you've been quite vocal about Lucian and trying to cast doubt on his intentions. But you haven't really given us any solid information about your own role. What exactly are you claiming to be, and do you have any details from last night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's silence and deflective response when questioned could be an attempt to avoid suspicion. Pressuring Dracula for more information might reveal inconsistencies in his story or make it clearer if he's hiding something.
> **Vladimir:** Dracula, you've been very quiet this whole time. Lucian has been pushing for information, and now you're deflecting back to me without providing any details yourself. What role are you claiming, and what did you learn last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's behavior has been suspicious, and he hasn't provided any concrete information about his role. We need to press him for details to uncover potential Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Vladimir, you've been deflecting questions and haven't given us any useful information about your role. What exactly are you claiming to be, and do you have any details from last night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's silence and deflective behavior are suspicious. Pressuring him for more information might reveal inconsistencies or clarify if he's hiding something.
> **Vladimir:** Dracula, you've been very quiet and deflective throughout this discussion. What role are you claiming, and did you gather any information last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's behavior has been suspicious, and he hasn't provided any concrete information about his role. We need to press him for details to uncover potential Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Vladimir, you've been very vocal about questioning Lucian, yet you haven't provided any solid information about your own role. What role are you claiming, and do you have any details from last night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's deflective behavior is suspicious, and we need to get more information from him to make an informed decision.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, let's focus on Dracula for a moment. Dracula, you've been quite deflective and haven't given us much information. What role are you claiming, and did you gather any useful information last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir has been deflecting and not giving us any useful information. If he has nothing to hide, he should be able to clarify his role and provide some details from the night. His behavior so far has been suspicious, and we need to get to the bottom of it.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, I think it's time we focus on Vladimir. He's been very elusive and hasn't provided us with any concrete information about his role. Vladimir, what exactly are you claiming to be, and do you have any details from last night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's deflections and lack of information are highly suspicious. We need to press him for more details to see if we can catch him in a lie or uncover valuable information that could help identify the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Dracula, you've been very defensive and haven't provided us with any useful information. What exactly are you claiming to be, and do you have any details from last night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian has been very vocal and pushing for information about the Masons, which could be a strategy to divert attention. With Mircea and myself confirmed as Masons, and no other concrete claims of special roles, I suspect Lucian might be trying to manipulate the discussion. Voting for Lucian seems the best way to protect the village.
> **Dragos [Mason]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea claimed to be a Mason and confirmed Dragos as another Mason. However, this could be a strategy to deflect attention and make their roles seem trustworthy. By voting for Mircea, I cast doubt on this confirmed Mason pair, potentially leading to confusion among the Villagers and increasing my chances of survival as the Werewolf.
> **Lucian [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the day phase, Vladimir has been very deflective and hasn't provided any concrete information about his role. He has been questioning others without offering details about his own role, which raises suspicion. Based on the information we have, he seems like the most likely candidate for being a Werewolf.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** Throughout the discussion, Vladimir has been very evasive and has not provided any concrete information about his role. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate he is trying to hide something. Since I am a Mason and can confirm Dragos as a fellow Mason, I believe it's prudent to vote for Vladimir to determine his true role.
> **Mircea [Mason]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been pushing very hard for the Masons to reveal themselves, which seemed like an attempt to gather information while keeping himself safe. His eagerness and insistence feel like a diversion tactic. While Dracula has been deflective, Lucian's behavior is more suspicious in the context of trying to manipulate the flow of information.
> **Vladimir [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Werewolf : 2
* Mircea : Mason : 1
* Vladimir : Villager : 2



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Lucian, Vladimir. The villagers win.
