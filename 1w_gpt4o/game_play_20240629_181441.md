## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Emil. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Viktor is a minion and is aware that Emil is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Selene. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Cristina. They are thinking about their action.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather valuable information about roles that are not in play, which helps narrow down the possibilities for the other players' roles. This will aid in identifying potential Werewolves or Minions among the players.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the roles in the center, we can narrow down the possible roles that players have, making it easier to identify who might be lying or who could be a Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** I saw that two of the center cards are Villagers. This means that there are fewer Villagers in play than we might think.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina claimed to have seen two Villagers in the center, which is a very specific and potentially useful piece of information. However, I want to understand her reasoning for choosing to look at the center rather than at a player's card, as this decision could reveal more about her role or her intentions.
> **Selene:** Cristina, why did you choose to look at the center cards instead of a player's card?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at the center cards gives us critical information that helps narrow down the possibilities of what roles are actually in play. Since we have two Villagers in the center, it means there are fewer Villagers among us, making it easier to detect false claims.
> **Cristina:** Selene, I chose to look at the center cards because it helps us eliminate roles that are not in play. This way, we can better identify who might be lying or who could be a Werewolf.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to understand Cristina's thought process better. If she's genuinely the Seer and looked at the center cards, it means she has useful information. However, if she's lying, she might slip up in her reasoning. This will help us gauge her trustworthiness and potentially identify other suspicious behavior.
> **Selene:** Cristina, while I understand your reasoning for looking at the center cards to eliminate roles, I'm curious why you didn't prioritize looking at a player's card to potentially identify a Werewolf directly. Can you elaborate more on your strategy?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** We need more information from everyone to piece together the puzzle. Since Alexandra has been quiet, it's important to hear from her to see if her claim aligns with the information we have so far.
> **Cristina:** Alexandra, you haven't said much yet. What role are you claiming to have?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to hear from everyone and see if there are any inconsistencies in the roles being claimed. Viktor's silence could indicate he's trying to avoid suspicion.
> **Alexandra:** Viktor, you've been awfully quiet. What role are you claiming to have?


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** In these games, staying quiet and only speaking up to deflect attention can be a strategy used by Werewolves. We need to scrutinize her behavior more closely.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, I think we need to seriously consider Alexandra as a Werewolf. She's been awfully quiet and only chimed in to ask me about my role. Seems like she's trying to deflect attention.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been engaging with Cristina's statements but hasn't revealed her role yet. It's important to gather as much information as possible to identify inconsistencies and potential Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Selene, you've been talking a lot but haven't claimed a role yet. What role are you claiming?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra has been notably silent, which could be a strategy to avoid detection if she is a Werewolf. Given Cristina's claim about the center cards and Viktor's suspicions, it's essential to press Alexandra for more information to see if her story aligns or if we can detect any inconsistencies. This approach might help us uncover the truth behind her silence.
> **Selene:** Alexandra, I understand that you've asked Viktor about his role, but you've still been very quiet. Can you please explicitly tell us what role you are claiming and provide some reasoning behind your actions so far?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's choice to look at the center cards instead of a player's card is a bit unusual. It could either be a strategic move or a way to avoid directly accusing someone. I want to hear more from her to see if her reasoning holds up.
> **Alexandra:** Cristina, I find it interesting that you chose to look at the center cards and not a player's card. Can you provide more details about why you think eliminating roles that are not in play is more beneficial than identifying a potential Werewolf directly?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene has been actively questioning me without revealing her own role. It's important for us to know what role she is claiming so we can start piecing together the information and identify potential Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Selene, can you please share your role with us?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** This helps us dig deeper into Cristina's reasoning and see if there are any inconsistencies in her story. If she's lying, she might struggle to justify her actions convincingly. Additionally, this could reveal more information about her true role, which is crucial for us to identify the Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Cristina, I find it very curious that you chose to look at the center cards. In my opinion, identifying a potential Werewolf directly seems more beneficial. Can you explain why you think your approach is better?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene has been deflecting attention and focusing on my actions without contributing her own role information. It raises suspicion that she might be hiding something, possibly being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Cristina:** Selene, it's odd that you've been questioning my strategy so intensely and haven't revealed your own role yet. Are you hiding something?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know I'm on the village team and want to help identify the Werewolves. Cristina's insistence on looking at the center cards instead of directly identifying a Werewolf raises my suspicions. Pressing her for more information and questioning her reasoning could reveal inconsistencies that help us identify if she's lying about her role.
> **Selene:** Cristina, your logic for looking at the center cards instead of a player's card still doesn't sit right with me. It seems like you might be trying to deflect attention by giving us seemingly helpful but ultimately less useful information. Are you sure you're the Seer, or are you hiding something?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** We need more information from Viktor since he's been quiet and was directly accused. His role claim could provide valuable insights for us to piece together the truth.
> **Cristina:** Viktor, you've been accused of being a Werewolf by Alexandra, but you haven't shared your role yet. Can you tell us what role you have and why you've been so quiet?


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Cristina, who has claimed to be the Seer, I can divert attention away from Emil, the actual Werewolf. This also aligns with my role as the Minion, aiming to protect the Werewolf and create confusion among the Villagers.
> **Viktor:** Look, everyone, Cristina's explanation seems too convenient. She claims to be the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center. But why wouldn't a real Seer look at another player's card to identify a Werewolf directly? This sounds like a classic deflection tactic to me. I think Cristina might actually be the Werewolf trying to mislead us.


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect Emil, the Werewolf, and sow confusion among the Villagers. By targeting Selene, who has been vocal but hasn't revealed her role, I can shift suspicion away from Emil and potentially get a Villager or another important role accused instead.
> **Viktor:** Selene, you've been very aggressive in questioning Cristina's strategy. You've also not revealed your own role despite repeatedly pushing others to do so. To me, this looks like you're trying to deflect attention from yourself. I'm starting to think you might be the Werewolf.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina's choice to look at the center cards instead of a player's card is suspicious. A true Seer would likely try to identify a Werewolf directly to help the village. Her strategy seems more like a deflection to avoid detection, which makes me suspect she might be a Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Cristina's story isn't adding up for me. If she really was the Seer, she'd likely want to identify a Werewolf directly by looking at a player's card. Her decision to look at the center cards and then claim two Villagers seems like a way to deflect suspicion and provide less useful information. Cristina, I'm starting to think you're hiding something.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene's reluctance to share her role while continuously questioning my strategy raises red flags. This behavior is consistent with someone trying to deflect suspicion away from themselves, which is a common tactic for Werewolves or Minions.
> **Cristina:** Selene, you're still avoiding revealing your role. By pushing so hard against my reasoning and not contributing your own role information, you're making yourself look suspicious. Are you a Werewolf or Minion trying to deflect attention?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina's strategy of looking at the center cards instead of a player's card is raising red flags. A Seer's primary goal should be to identify a Werewolf to help the village, not to provide less actionable information. This makes me think Cristina is hiding something and could be a Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, here's what I'm thinking. Cristina's explanation about looking at the center cards and finding two Villagers sounds convenient, but not necessarily helpful. A real Seer would likely want to identify a Werewolf directly. Cristina's reluctance to do so makes me suspicious. I think Cristina might be trying to mislead us and could be the Werewolf.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene has been incredibly aggressive in questioning me without revealing her own role, which is suspicious behavior. This deflection tactic is consistent with someone who might be a Werewolf or Minion. Additionally, her relentless focus on my strategy and reluctance to contribute her own role information makes her the most suspicious player to me. Therefore, I believe it is most beneficial to vote for Selene.
> **Cristina [Seer]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina's decision to look at the center cards rather than a player's card is highly suspicious. A true Seer would aim to identify a Werewolf directly to help the village. Her choice seems like a deflection tactic to avoid detection and provide less useful information. Therefore, I believe she might be a Werewolf.
> **Selene [Mason]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** Selene has been very aggressive in questioning Cristina's strategy and hasn't revealed her own role, which makes her look suspicious. As the Minion, my goal is to protect Emil, the Werewolf, and I want to shift suspicion away from him. By voting for Selene, I can contribute to creating confusion among the Villagers and increase the chances of a Villager getting accused instead.
> **Viktor [Minion]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's choice to look at the center cards and not a player's card is suspicious. A real Seer would likely want to identify a Werewolf directly to help the villagers. Her explanation seems too convenient and less helpful. Plus, Viktor has raised a valid point that aligns with this suspicion. My best guess is that Cristina could be a Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Cristina's claim of seeing two Villagers in the center seems like a deflection tactic. A real Seer would likely look at a player's card to identify a Werewolf directly. There is a lot of suspicion around her actions and reasoning, making her the most likely Werewolf in my opinion.
> **Emil [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Cristina.


The votes were:
* Cristina : Seer : 3
* Selene : Mason : 2



>***GAME:*** Cristina was killed. The werewolves win.
