## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Starting with a direct question could reveal valuable information. If Ileana hesitates or gives an inconsistent answer, it might indicate she's hiding something. As a Villager, I need to gather as much information as possible to identify the Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** Ileana, what role did you wake up with?


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing my role as a Mason, I aim to build trust among the Villagers and help us identify the Werewolves. Sharing this information early can also eliminate confusion about the Mason role and focus our attention on finding the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Mircea, I woke up as a Mason and looked for another Mason but didn't find one. This means the other Mason card is likely in the center.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim of being a Mason needs to be cross-checked, and understanding Radu's claim might help establish or debunk her statement. If Radu claims to be something different, it could lead to more revelations.
> **Mircea:** Radu, what role did you wake up with?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to verify Mircea's role since he directed a question at Ileana, and we need to gather more information to identify the Werewolves.
> **Radu:** Ileana claims to be a Mason and didn't find another Mason, which likely means the other Mason card is in the center. Mircea, what role did you wake up with?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible. Ileana claims to be a Mason and didn't find another Mason, which could mean the other Mason card is in the center. Radu seems to be validating Ileana's claim indirectly, but I need to hear from Andrei to get a fuller picture and possibly confirm or challenge these claims.
> **Mircea:** Alright, Radu, I'll answer your question. I woke up as a Villager. We've got some information on the table, but not enough. Andrei, what role did you wake up with?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to see if Radu will provide more information that might help us verify the claims on the table or uncover any inconsistencies.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, Ileana claims to be a Mason and didn't find another Mason, so she might be telling the truth. Mircea, you say you're a Villager, but I think we need more information. Radu, what role did you wake up with?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has deflected attention by commenting on others' claims but hasn't revealed his own role yet. We need to hear his role to get a clearer picture.
> **Radu:** Andrei, you still haven't told us your role. We need more information from everyone at the table.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea claimed to be a Villager, Ileana claimed to be a Mason, and both of them have provided their roles. We need Radu to disclose his role to get a clearer picture and find any inconsistencies in the claims.
> **Andrei:** Alright, everyone, I think we need some clarity here. Radu, you've been avoiding giving us information about your role. What role did you wake up with?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been avoiding giving his role, while also trying to direct attention away from himself. This could be a tactic to hide his identity, so we need to hear from him directly to see if there's any inconsistency or hesitation that might give away his true role.
> **Radu:** Andrei, it's time for you to come clean. Tell us your role.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been deflecting questions and avoiding giving us information about his role. We need to hear from him to verify the existing claims and uncover any inconsistencies.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, I'm a Villager, and my main goal is to identify the Werewolves. Mircea claims to be a Villager and Ileana claims to be a Mason who didn't find another Mason. Both of these claims seem plausible, but we need to hear more from Radu.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been hesitant to reveal his role and has been deflecting attention. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate that he is trying to hide his true identity as a Werewolf.
> **Radu:** Andrei, your answers have been quite vague and deflective. I strongly suspect you might be a Werewolf trying to avoid suspicion. Can you clarify your role once more and provide more details about why we should believe you?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been avoiding giving us information, and this is stalling our progress in identifying the Werewolves. If Radu is indeed a Villager or another role on the village team, he should have no problem sharing his role. His reluctance makes me suspicious, and we need to hear from him to verify the existing claims and uncover any inconsistencies.
> **Andrei:** Radu, you still haven't told us your role. We're all trying to get to the bottom of this, and your reluctance to share is suspicious. What role did you wake up with?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been deflecting attention and hasn't provided any solid information about his role. This kind of behavior is typical of someone trying to hide their true identity, potentially as a Werewolf. We need him to be more transparent to verify his claims.
> **Radu:** Andrei, you've been avoiding giving us clear information and that seems very suspicious to me. I think you're trying to hide something. Why should we trust you?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has consistently avoided giving any information about his role. This behavior is highly suspicious and makes it difficult for us to trust him. We need to hear his role to verify the claims on the table and identify any inconsistencies.
> **Andrei:** Radu, your reluctance to share your role has been making me and others suspicious. If you're a Villager or on the village team, you should have no problem telling us your role. What role did you wake up with?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's behavior has been evasive and deflective. He hasn't provided any solid information about his role and keeps turning the attention back to others. This is typical behavior of someone trying to hide their true identity, potentially as a Werewolf. We need him to be more transparent to verify his claims.
> **Radu:** Andrei, you still haven't given us a solid answer about your role, and your deflections are making me very suspicious. I think you might be trying to hide that you're a Werewolf.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been consistently deflecting and avoiding questions about his role, which is highly suspicious behavior. We need to hear from him to verify the existing claims and identify any inconsistencies.
> **Andrei:** Radu, it's suspicious that you've been avoiding sharing your role. If you're truly on the village team, you should have no issue telling us what role you woke up with. What role did you wake up with?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been deflecting and avoiding giving clear answers, which is typical for someone trying to hide their true role. We need him to clarify his stance to determine if he's a Werewolf.
> **Radu:** Andrei, it's quite interesting how you've been deflecting questions and avoiding providing concrete information. This behavior is making everyone suspicious. Why should we believe you're not a Werewolf?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been consistently deflecting and avoiding questions about his role, which is highly suspicious behavior. We need to hear from him to verify the claims on the table and identify any inconsistencies. His reluctance makes it difficult for us to trust him and points towards him being a potential Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** Radu, your constant deflection and reluctance to reveal your role are highly suspicious. If you were truly on the village team, you would have no problem sharing your role with us. I suspect you might be hiding something. Everyone, I think Radu could be a Werewolf!


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been deflective and evasive, which is typical behavior for someone trying to hide their true identity. His refusal to provide clear information makes him a prime suspect for being a Werewolf. We need him to clarify his stance to determine if he's indeed hiding something.
> **Radu:** Andrei, your reluctance to reveal your role and your constant deflection makes me highly suspicious. I believe you might be a Werewolf. Why should we believe you're not?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's reluctance to provide information is highly suspicious and is hindering our progress in identifying the Werewolves. By forcing him to reveal his role, we can verify the claims on the table and uncover any inconsistencies.
> **Andrei:** Radu, your consistent deflection of questions and avoidance to reveal your role is making me, and likely everyone else, suspicious. If you're truly on the village team, there should be no issue in sharing your role with us. So, for the benefit of everyone, what role did you wake up with?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's reluctance and consistent deflection of questions throughout the discussion are highly suspicious. He never disclosed his role, which is a common trait of someone trying to hide their Werewolf identity. Ileana's claim as a Mason seems plausible and unchallenged, and Andrei's claim as a Villager aligns with my own role. Given the available information, Radu appears to be the most likely Werewolf.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei has been very deflective and vague throughout the discussion. His reluctance to share his role and the repeated attempts to redirect suspicion onto Radu make him the most suspicious player. As a Mason, I want to ensure we eliminate any potential Werewolves, and Andrei's behavior aligns more with someone trying to hide their identity.
> **Ileana [Mason]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been evasive and deflective throughout the discussion. This behavior is suspicious and typical of someone trying to hide their true identity, potentially as a Werewolf. We need to eliminate him to verify his role and ensure the safety of the village.
> **Radu [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's consistent deflection and refusal to reveal his role make him highly suspicious. If he were truly on the village team, he would have no problem sharing his role with us. This behavior points towards him potentially being a Werewolf or Minion, so I believe voting for him is the best choice.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Radu's reluctance to reveal his role throughout the discussion raises significant suspicion. This behavior aligns more with that of a Werewolf trying to avoid detection. By voting for Radu, we increase the chances of not eliminating a fellow Werewolf inadvertently.
> **Vladimir [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Radu.


The votes were:
* Radu : Villager : 3
* Andrei : Villager : 2



>***GAME:*** Radu was killed. The werewolves win.
