## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Mircea. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Emil is a minion and is aware that Mircea is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Stefan. They are thinking about their action.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles that are not in play. This will help narrow down the possible roles of the other players, making it easier to identify potential Werewolves or other key roles. Additionally, it ensures that I do not risk revealing my Seer role too early by directly targeting another player.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** If the Seer or Masons reveal themselves, their information could be crucial in identifying the Werewolves. Since I'm a Villager, I want to make sure we start with the most solid information we can get.
> **Vladimir:** Hey everyone, let's start off by hearing from anyone who has an important role like the Seer or the Masons. It will help us narrow things down.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing my role as the Seer early on helps to build trust and provides valuable information to the group. By confirming two cards in the center, we can better identify suspicious claims and work together to find the Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Alright, I'll start. I am the Seer. I looked at two cards in the center: a Mason and a Villager. This means we have one Mason and two Villagers among us. We can use this to narrow down our search for Werewolves and other roles.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Since Stefan claimed to be the Seer and provided information about the center cards, it’s important to keep the conversation going and get other players to reveal their roles. This will help me gather more information and create confusion later if necessary.
> **Mircea:** Alright, Stefan, thanks for starting us off. That does help. So if there was a Mason and a Villager in the center, that means we should have one Mason and two Villagers among us. That aligns with our card distribution. Does anyone else want to share their roles or anything they observed?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information to piece things together, and hearing from Mircea could help confirm or challenge Stefan's claim.
> **Andrei:** Alright, Mircea, I want to hear from you next. What role do you claim to have?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I'm positioning myself as a non-threatening player, which should help avoid suspicion. Asking Vladimir directly puts him on the spot and encourages more information to surface. As the only Werewolf, I need to steer the conversation and gather more clues about the other players' roles to deflect attention away from myself.
> **Mircea:** Alright, Andrei, I'm claiming to be a Villager. I know it's not the most exciting role, but it's important for us Villagers to stay united and figure out who the Werewolves are. I'd like to hear from Vladimir next. What's your role, Vladimir?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea and I have both claimed to be Villagers. Hearing from Emil next will help us gather more information and check for any inconsistencies. If we can rule out roles, we can narrow down who might be the Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, Mircea, thanks for your statement. I'm also a Villager, which means we've identified two of the three Villagers already. If we can hear from the remaining players about their roles, we can start putting the puzzle together.


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** Since Stefan's Seer claim checks out with the distribution of roles, we need to find out what Andrei's role is to paint a clearer picture. By doing this, we can determine if anyone's lying about their roles, especially focusing on whether anyone might secretly be a Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Alright, I think it's my turn to chime in. So far, we have Stefan claiming to be the Seer and he saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Mircea and Vladimir both claim to be Villagers. Personally, I'm also a Villager. This should account for all the Villagers among us. However, we've yet to hear from Andrei. Andrei, what role do you claim to have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more information and see if anyone contradicts themselves or exposes a flaw in their logic. By opening up the floor for more discussion, we might catch someone slipping up.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's think about this logically. Stefan claimed to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, which checks out with the number of Villager and Mason claims we've had. But we still have some roles unaccounted for and there could be deception. Mircea, Vladimir, and Emil have all claimed to be Villagers, but that leaves us with potentially two Werewolves and a Minion among us. If we're to trust Stefan's Seer claim, then the Minion and Werewolves must be among the rest of us. Does anyone want to challenge these claims or provide more information?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** With three Villagers already claimed and Stefan's Seer claim aligning with the card distribution, Andrei's role remains suspiciously unaccounted for. By directing attention to Andrei and questioning his role, I aim to deflect suspicion from myself and Mircea, while potentially sowing doubt among the Villagers.
> **Emil:** Andrei, I can't shake the feeling that something doesn't add up here. You've been a bit quiet and analytical, which makes me wonder if you're trying to mislead us. If we have three Villager claims already and Stefan's Seer claim checks out, then where do you fit into this picture? I'm starting to think you might be the Werewolf hiding among us.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to double-check Stefan's claim as the Seer. If he slips up or shows hesitation, it might indicate he's not being truthful. This can help us narrow down potential Werewolves or deceitful players.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's break this down. Stefan claims to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Mircea, Vladimir, and Emil have all claimed to be Villagers. But we know there are still roles unaccounted for, including the Minion and the Werewolves. If we trust Stefan's Seer claim, then the Minion and the Werewolves must be hiding among us. I want to hear from Stefan again to get more details on his Seer experience. Stefan, can you elaborate on how confident you are about your Seer findings?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei has been deflecting and trying to cast doubt without revealing his own role. Getting him to state his role could either confirm his loyalty or expose a potential deception.
> **Stefan:** Andrei, I understand your skepticism, but I want to point out that if I'm telling the truth about being the Seer and the cards I saw in the center, then the roles accounted for so far make sense. You still haven't explicitly stated your role. Can you please tell us what role you have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's claim as the Seer and seeing a Mason and Villager in the center should logically account for the roles. However, with everyone else claiming Villager, there's something off. This might help us uncover deception.
> **Andrei:** Stefan, I have a hard time believing your Seer claim. If you really saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, and we have three Villager claims already, we're missing one critical piece here—either the Minion or Werewolf claims. This seems fishy to me.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei's behavior has been suspicious, and he's the only one who hasn't clearly claimed a role yet. Pressing him to reveal his role will help us determine if he's hiding something and potentially expose him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Stefan:** Andrei, you've been very evasive and haven't clearly stated your role yet. Given the claims we've had so far, I think it's likely you're hiding something. Are you the Minion or one of the Werewolves?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to double-check Stefan's claim as the Seer. If he slips up or shows hesitation, it might indicate he's not being truthful. This can help us narrow down potential Werewolves or deceitful players.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's break down the claims. Stefan claims to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Mircea, Vladimir, and Emil have all claimed to be Villagers. But we know there are still roles unaccounted for, including the Minion and the Werewolves. If we trust Stefan's Seer claim, then the Minion and the Werewolves must be hiding among us. I want to hear from Stefan again to get more details on his Seer experience. Stefan, can you elaborate on how confident you are about your Seer findings?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei has been evasive and has not clearly claimed a role, which is suspicious. Pressing him to reveal his role could potentially expose him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Stefan:** Andrei, you've been avoiding stating your role clearly and trying to cast doubt on my Seer claim. Given the information we have, I'm highly suspicious of you. Are you the Minion or one of the Werewolves?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir has been quiet since his initial claim of being a Villager. I want to see if he has more to offer or if he is hiding something. His response might help us identify inconsistencies or provide valuable information.
> **Andrei:** Vladimir, I find it odd that you're quick to call others out but haven't really contributed much beyond your initial claim of being a Villager. Can you provide more insight into why you believe your claim is true and if you have any suspicions about other players?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's Seer claim is crucial to our strategy. If he saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, it helps us narrow down the remaining roles. I need to verify his claim to make sure we're not being misled.
> **Vladimir:** Stefan, I want to trust your Seer claim, but I need to be sure. Can you please confirm the exact cards you saw in the center? Your initial claim was a Mason and a Villager, right?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei has consistently avoided revealing his role and has been trying to cast doubt on others. Pressing him to clearly state his role could expose whether he is hiding something, potentially revealing him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Stefan:** Andrei, you still haven't clearly stated your role, and you've been deflecting questions. This behavior is highly suspicious. Are you the Minion or one of the Werewolves?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's minimal contributions raise suspicion. Getting him to provide more details or catching inconsistencies in his statements could help identify if he's lying or hiding something. This might also prompt others to provide more insights.
> **Andrei:** Vladimir, you've been pretty quiet since your initial Villager claim. Can you provide more details on why you're certain you're a Villager and if you have any suspicions about other players? If we're going to find the Werewolves, we need everyone to be active and contribute.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's Seer claim seems consistent, and the fact that Andrei hasn't clearly stated his role and is trying to deflect suspicion makes him look very guilty. We need to focus on him to uncover the truth.
> **Vladimir:** Andrei, your evasiveness and analytical approach are making me very suspicious of you. You've been trying to cast doubt on Stefan's Seer claim without clearly stating your own role. Are you the Minion or one of the Werewolves?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been evasive and hasn't clearly stated his role, which is highly suspicious. Stefan's Seer claim seems consistent and aligns with the Villager claims from Mircea, Emil, and me. To uncover the truth and based on the information we have, Andrei seems the most likely to be hiding a Werewolf or Minion role.
> **Vladimir [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei has been consistently evasive about his role, trying to cast doubt on my Seer claim without providing any clear information about his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with that of a Werewolf or Minion. Based on the information provided, voting for Andrei is the best move to identify and eliminate a potential threat to the village team.
> **Stefan [Seer]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Andrei has been evasive and has not clearly stated his role. His attempts to cast doubt on Stefan's Seer claim without providing concrete information make him highly suspicious. Voting for him increases the chance of targeting a potential Minion or Werewolf, which aligns with my goal as a Werewolf to deflect attention from myself.
> **Mircea [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's claim of being the Seer and seeing a Mason and Villager in the center should mean we have one Mason among us. However, we haven't heard from a Mason, which raises doubts about his claim. Additionally, if Stefan is not the Seer, he might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us. Voting for him seems like the best move to ensure we have a chance of hitting a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei has been evasive and analytical, casting doubt on Stefan's Seer claim without clearly stating his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with someone trying to mislead the group. By voting for Andrei, I aim to help deflect suspicion away from Mircea and myself, and potentially secure a win for the Werewolf team.
> **Emil [Minion]:** I am voting for Andrei.


The votes were:
* Stefan : Seer : 1
* Andrei : Villager : 4



>***GAME:*** Andrei was killed. The werewolves win.
