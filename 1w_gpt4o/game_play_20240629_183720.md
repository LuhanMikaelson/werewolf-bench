## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Ileana. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Stefan and Cristina. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Selene. They are thinking about their action.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gain information about the roles that are not in play. This helps narrow down the possible roles other players might have and could reveal if any key roles (like a Werewolf or the Minion) are in the center, making it safer to trust claims from other players.

>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing that I am a Mason and confirming Cristina as the other Mason, we can establish some trust and eliminate the possibility of Cristina being a werewolf. This will help narrow down our suspects.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, let's start figuring out who the werewolves are. I'll go first and share that I'm a Mason and I saw Cristina as the other Mason.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** If Cristina confirms Stefan's claim, then we can rule them both out as Werewolves. If she doesn't, then there's something suspicious going on here.
> **Lucian:** Alright, Stefan, you claim to be a Mason and you saw Cristina as the other Mason. Cristina, can you confirm you saw Stefan?


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** By confirming Stefan's statement, I am supporting his claim and establishing trust between us. This also helps to narrow down the pool of potential Werewolves, since both Stefan and I are not Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Yes, I can confirm that Stefan is also a Mason. We are both on the village team.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** Now that Stefan and I have established trust, we need to gather information from the other players. By asking Lucian directly, we can see how he responds and start narrowing down possible Werewolf suspects.
> **Cristina:** Alright, since Stefan and I are both confirmed Masons, that means we are definitely not Werewolves. Lucian, what role do you claim to be?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more information from the other players to identify the Werewolves. Since Stefan and Cristina are likely telling the truth, we can safely focus on the remaining players.
> **Lucian:** I understand that Stefan and Cristina have confirmed each other as Masons. This narrows our suspects quite a bit. Selene, what role do you claim to be?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** We already have Stefan and Cristina confirming each other as Masons, which means they are likely on the village team. Since I've seen the Minion and a Villager in the center, we know those roles are not in play. This leaves fewer roles for the rest of us. Lucian hasn't claimed a role yet, and Ileana has been quiet. We need to put some pressure on them to reveal more.
> **Selene:** I think we should consider the possibility that Ileana might be a Werewolf. Lucian hasn't revealed his role yet either, which makes me a bit suspicious.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Stefan and Cristina have confirmed each other as Masons and I know that the Minion and one Villager are in the center, we need to narrow down the possibilities. Lucian's role claim is crucial to figuring this out.
> **Selene:** Lucian, you haven't revealed your role yet. What are you claiming to be?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** If Stefan and Cristina are both Masons, they are on the village team. This leaves only a few players unconfirmed: myself, Selene, and Ileana. Since I know I'm a Villager, the Werewolves must be among Selene and Ileana.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, based on Stefan and Cristina confirming each other as Masons, it seems highly likely they are telling the truth. This narrows our potential Werewolves down to Selene and Ileana.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Stefan and Cristina seem to be working together and their claims are corroborated. Lucian's lack of a role claim makes him look suspicious. Pressuring him might reveal more useful information or create enough doubt to shift focus away from me.
> **Ileana:** Alright, given that Stefan and Cristina have confirmed each other as Masons, that clears them from being Werewolves. Lucian, you've been a bit evasive and haven't revealed your role yet. What exactly are you claiming to be?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been quick to accuse others but hasn't revealed her own role, which is suspicious. By questioning her, we may be able to gather more information and clarify her motives. Considering Stefan and Cristina have confirmed each other as Masons, it makes sense to scrutinize those who haven't revealed their roles yet.
> **Lucian:** I find it strange that Selene is trying to deflect suspicion onto Ileana and me without giving her own role. Selene, why are you so quick to point fingers without providing any information about yourself?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the information I have, I can help clarify which roles are not in play and narrow down the suspects. This will help us identify the remaining Werewolf or Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone. Based on what we know, Stefan and Cristina have verified each other as Masons. I looked at two cards in the center: Minion and Villager. This means those roles are not in play.


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian has been evasive and hasn't revealed his role yet, which makes him suspicious. It's crucial for us to gather as much information as possible to identify the Werewolves, and his silence isn't helping.
> **Stefan:** Alright, Lucian, you've been avoiding revealing your role for quite a while now. Given that Cristina and I have confirmed each other as Masons, and Selene has claimed to have seen the Minion and Villager in the center, it would be really helpful if you could tell us your role.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Stefan and Cristina are likely telling the truth and Selene has provided specific information, it makes sense to direct the scrutiny towards Ileana who hasn't given any concrete information. We need to gather more details from her to determine if she's hiding something.
> **Lucian:** Alright, I'm a Villager. Considering Stefan and Cristina have confirmed each other as Masons and Selene claims to have seen the Minion and Villager in the center, it's strange to me that Ileana hasn't given any clear role yet. Ileana, what role do you claim to be?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian's reluctance to reveal his role could indicate he is hiding something. By pressing him further, I can shift the suspicion away from myself and hopefully keep the focus on him.
> **Ileana:** Alright, let me lay out what we know so far. Stefan and Cristina have both confirmed each other as Masons, and Selene has claimed to have seen Minion and Villager in the center. Lucian, however, has been quite evasive and only now claims to be a Villager. This makes me highly suspicious of him. Lucian, why didn't you reveal your role earlier?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan and Cristina have already been confirmed as Masons, and Selene has given useful information about the center cards. Ileana's deflective behavior and lack of clear role make her suspicious. We need to focus on her to uncover the truth.
> **Lucian:** I find it suspicious that Ileana is trying so hard to deflect attention towards me when I simply took time to gather my thoughts. Given that Stefan and Cristina have confirmed each other as Masons and Selene has provided information about the center cards, I think Ileana might be a Werewolf trying to cover her tracks.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Given that Stefan and Cristina have confirmed each other as Masons and Selene has provided specific information about the center cards, Ileana's behavior is the most suspicious. We need to focus on her to uncover the truth and potentially identify her as a Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** I'm finding it really suspicious that Ileana is deflecting attention towards me and hasn't given a clear role yet. Everyone, we need to consider the possibility that Ileana is a Werewolf.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana has been evasive and hasn't given a clear role, which makes me highly suspicious of her. We need to get more information from her to determine if she's a Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Ileana, you still haven't clearly stated your role, and that seems really suspicious to me. Are you hiding something? Why haven't you been straightforward about your role?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian's delayed response in revealing his role makes him look suspicious. By questioning him directly, I can shift the focus towards him and away from myself. Keeping the suspicion on Lucian helps me avoid drawing attention to my own role as the Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and consider the information we have so far. Stefan and Cristina have verified each other as Masons, which seems credible. Selene has claimed to have seen the Minion and Villager in the center, and Lucian has finally claimed to be a Villager. I think it's quite likely that the real Seer could be someone else who is not speaking up due to fear of being targeted. Lucian, why did it take you so long to reveal your role when everyone else was being transparent?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's deflection and lack of transparency make her the most suspicious. We need to put pressure on her to reveal her role and see if she's hiding something.
> **Lucian:** Ileana, you've been really evasive and you still haven't told us your role. Given that Stefan and Cristina have confirmed each other as Masons and Selene has provided information about the center cards, it seems like you're trying to hide something. Are you a Werewolf?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian's delay in revealing his role makes him a prime candidate for suspicion. By questioning him directly, I can keep the focus on him and shift attention away from myself as the Werewolf. If I can create enough doubt about Lucian, it increases the chances that others will vote for him instead of me.
> **Ileana:** Alright, everyone, let's piece this together step by step. Stefan and Cristina have verified each other as Masons, which seems solid. Selene's claim about seeing Minion and Villager in the center adds up. Lucian has only now claimed to be a Villager, which came across as hesitant and evasive. I find this really suspicious. Lucian, why did you take so long to reveal your role?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian has been evasive and only revealed his role as a Villager after being repeatedly pressed, which makes him more suspicious compared to others who have been more transparent. Additionally, Selene's claim as the Seer and seeing the Minion and Villager in the center leaves Lucian and Ileana as the most likely suspects. Given the overall interactions, Lucian seems the more likely Werewolf.
> **Stefan [Mason]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan and Cristina have confirmed each other as Masons, which makes them likely to be telling the truth. Selene has provided specific information about the center cards, claiming to have seen Minion and Villager, which seems credible. Ileana has been evasive and deflective throughout the discussion, making her the most suspicious player. Voting for Ileana maximizes the chances of eliminating a Werewolf.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** Stefan and I have confirmed each other as Masons, which makes us trustworthy. Selene has provided credible information about seeing Minion and Villager in the center, which aligns with the available roles. Lucian's hesitation to reveal his role is suspicious, but Ileana has been even more evasive and hasn't given a clear role despite repeated questioning. This behavior strongly suggests that she might be a Werewolf.
> **Cristina [Mason]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian has been evasive and delayed in revealing his role, which makes him the most suspicious. By voting for Lucian, we have a better chance of eliminating a potential Werewolf and winning the game for the village team.
> **Selene [Seer]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian’s hesitation in revealing his role makes him suspicious. Stefan and Cristina have confirmed each other as Masons, and Selene has provided consistent information about the center cards. Casting my vote for Lucian increases the chances of shifting attention away from myself and possibly eliminating a Villager.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Villager : 3
* Ileana : Werewolf : 2



>***GAME:*** Lucian was killed. The werewolves win.
