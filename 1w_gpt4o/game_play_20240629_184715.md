## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Dracula. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dragos. They are thinking about their action.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather information about which roles are not in play. This will help narrow down the possible roles for each player and make it easier to identify the Werewolves or other key roles during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** The Seer has the ability to look at one player's card or two center cards. If the Seer reveals useful information, it could help us identify who the Werewolves might be or at least clear some players of suspicion.
> **Kraven:** Hey everyone, I think it would be helpful if we start by having the Seer reveal what they saw last night. This could give us some crucial information.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven suggested that the Seer reveal their information, which seems like a solid idea. If the Seer can confirm or deny any suspicions right away, it will help us determine the roles faster.
> **Cristina:** Alright, I think the Seer revealing their information right now would be a good start. If the Seer saw anything suspicious, it can really help us narrow down our suspects.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By encouraging the Seer to reveal their information, I can gather more clues about who's who. If someone claims to be the Seer, I can later challenge them or spin the narrative in a different direction. This also makes me appear like a proactive Villager looking for answers.
> **Dracula:** Alright, I'll kick things off. I'm curious if anyone here is willing to claim the Seer role and share what they saw. This could really help us narrow down our suspects. If the Seer saw any suspicious activity, it would be a big help to the rest of us.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos hasn't spoken yet, and it's important to get as much information as possible from all players. This could help us identify inconsistencies and find the Werewolves.
> **Radu:** Alright, I want to hear from Dragos. Do you claim to have any special role, and if so, what did you see during the night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the information about the center cards, I can help eliminate some roles from suspicion and guide the discussion towards identifying the actual Werewolves among the players.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, I think we need to start narrowing things down. I can confirm that two of the center cards are Mason and Minion. This means those roles are definitely not among us. Let's focus on identifying the potential Werewolves among the players.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Kraven was eager to start the discussion and wanted the Seer to reveal their information, it's important to know if he's bluffing or genuinely trying to help. This can provide more clarity on his role and intentions.
> **Dragos:** Alright, we've established that the Mason and Minion roles are in the center, so let's narrow down who's who. I want to hear from Kraven next. Kraven, do you claim to have a special role, and if so, what did you see during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to gather as much information as possible from everyone. Dragos's claim may be a good starting point, but we need to hear from others to corroborate the story or reveal inconsistencies.
> **Kraven:** Dragos, I find it interesting that you claim to have seen the Mason and Minion in the center. If this is true, then we don't have to worry about those roles being among us. However, I still want to hear from Cristina and Dracula about their roles. Cristina, are you willing to share any information about your role or what you know?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos' claim could be a tactic to divert suspicion from himself if he is actually a Werewolf. I want to hear from Dracula to cross-verify Dragos' claim and see if there's any inconsistency in their statements.
> **Cristina:** Dragos, I find it very convenient that you claim to have seen the Mason and Minion in the center. If you're telling the truth, then we should have two Masons passing as Villagers among us. However, I want to hear what Dracula has to say about his role before we proceed further.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Cristina and questioning her motivations, I can subtly cast suspicion on her while also diverting attention away from myself. This helps to create doubt and confusion among the other players.
> **Dracula:** Cristina, I find it interesting that you're quick to question Dragos. If Dragos is telling the truth and two of the center cards are Mason and Minion, that leaves us with fewer suspects for the Werewolves. But what about you, Cristina? What role do you claim to have or what information can you share?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula seems to be deflecting and questioning me instead of providing any useful information. If Dracula has something to hide, it's better to get him to reveal it now. His deflection might indicate he's protecting himself or has something to conceal.
> **Cristina:** Dracula, I appreciate you deflecting the question, but I'm not ready to reveal my role just yet. Instead, I want to hear more from you. Do you have any concrete information or are you just avoiding the question?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Cristina to reveal her role, I can shift the focus onto her and potentially create confusion. If she hesitates or gives an inconsistent answer, it will make her look more suspicious, diverting attention away from me.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, I think we need to address something here. Dragos, you're claiming to have seen the Mason and Minion in the center. This means the roles we have left are Werewolf, Seer, Villager, and Drunk among the players. But here's the thing: if Cristina is hesitating to reveal her role, it makes me suspicious. Cristina, it's time to come clean about your role. Are you hiding something?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos' claim takes away significant roles, leaving us with fewer suspects. If Radu can provide credible information, we can cross-verify the claims and narrow down potential Werewolves. It's important to gather as much information as possible to identify inconsistencies.
> **Cristina:** Alright, I think it's time for us to focus our attention. Dragos claims to have seen the Mason and Minion in the center, which is a bold claim. But we haven't heard from Radu yet. Radu, can you tell us what role you claim to have and if you saw anything during the night?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos's claim about the Mason and Minion being in the center is bold and could be an attempt to mislead us. By questioning him directly, we can see how he responds and look for any signs of deception.
> **Radu:** Dragos, you're claiming to have seen the Mason and Minion in the center, but I find that a bit too convenient. If you're lying, it would make you look like a Seer, which could protect an actual Werewolf. I'm starting to suspect you might be trying to throw us off. Why should we believe you?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula has been deflecting questions and trying to put the spotlight on others without providing any substantial information himself. This behavior could indicate that he is trying to avoid revealing his own role, potentially because he has something to hide.
> **Dragos:** Alright, given that the Mason and Minion are in the center, I'm inclined to believe we should focus on narrowing down those left who could be Werewolves. Dracula, you seem to be probing a lot but haven't shared much about your own role. What role do you claim to have and what did you see during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By summarizing the current situation and casting suspicion on Cristina and Radu, I aim to create doubt and confusion among the players. This way, I can divert attention away from myself and potentially get others to reveal more information, which I can then use to my advantage.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and look at the information we have. Dragos claims to have seen the Mason and Minion in the center, which, if true, means those roles are out of play. Cristina seems hesitant to reveal any information, which makes me suspicious. Radu, you also questioned Dragos but didn't reveal anything about your role. This leads me to believe that we might have some sneaky roles in play here. I think it's time we start narrowing down our suspects.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has been deflecting questions and avoiding revealing her role. This hesitation makes her a prime suspect and it's crucial to get more information from her.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's focus on some specifics. Cristina, you've been quite hesitant to reveal your role. We're running out of time and need to make a decision. What exactly is your role and what did you see during the night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos' claim effectively removes two roles from suspicion, but it also could be a tactic to avoid detection. By pressing Dragos for more details, we might uncover if he is lying or not.
> **Cristina:** Dragos, I find your claim very convenient. If you really saw the Mason and Minion in the center, then that narrows down our potential Werewolves. But you could be lying to cover for yourself. Can you provide any more details or reasoning behind your claim?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina has been avoiding revealing her role and deflecting questions. This behavior is highly suspicious and could indicate that she is trying to hide her true role, possibly a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos:** Cristina, you've been quite hesitant and deflective throughout this discussion. Your reluctance to reveal your role is highly suspicious. Are you hiding something? I think it's time you come clean about your role and what you saw during the night.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been very vocal about seeing the Mason and Minion in the center, which conveniently removes two roles from suspicion. This could be a tactic to divert attention away from himself if he is actually a Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Dragos, I'm finding your claim about seeing the Mason and Minion in the center very suspicious. You've been very assertive with your information, and it seems like you're trying to steer us away from questioning you further. Why should we believe you?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina has been avoiding revealing her role and deflecting questions, which is highly suspicious behavior. As the Seer, I have confirmed that Mason and Minion are in the center, so we need to narrow down the potential Werewolves among us.
> **Dragos:** Cristina, your reluctance to reveal your role and constant deflecting is making you look very suspicious. Are you hiding something? I think it's time you come clean about your role and what you saw during the night.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's reluctance to reveal her role and her constant deflecting of questions have made her the most suspicious player. If Dragos's claim about the Mason and Minion being in the center is true, it narrows down our potential Werewolves, and Cristina's behavior aligns with that of a Werewolf trying to avoid suspicion.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos claimed to have seen the Mason and Minion in the center, but I find this claim suspicious. His assertiveness and reluctance to provide further details make me doubt his honesty. Voting for Dragos seems like the best option to uncover whether he is lying to protect himself or to mislead us.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Cristina has been consistently hesitant to reveal her role and has deflected questions throughout the discussion. This behavior is highly suspicious, and it's possible that she's trying to hide being a Werewolf. By voting for Cristina, I aim to increase the chances of eliminating a potential threat to my team.
> **Dracula [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos's claim about seeing the Mason and Minion in the center seems too convenient and could be a way to mislead us as a Werewolf or Minion. Additionally, Dragos did not provide any substantial evidence to support his claim, making him a prime suspect.
> **Radu [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina has been consistently hesitant to reveal her role and has deflected questions multiple times, which is highly suspicious behavior. Given that I confirmed the Mason and Minion are in the center, I believe Cristina might be trying to hide that she is a Werewolf.
> **Dragos [Seer]:** I am voting for Cristina.


The votes were:
* Cristina : Villager : 3
* Dragos : Seer : 2



>***GAME:*** Cristina was killed. The werewolves win.
