## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Semira. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Cristina. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Larisa. They are thinking about their action.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can potentially gather more information about the roles that are not in play. This might help with deducing the roles of other players more effectively during the day phase. Additionally, since there are three cards in the center, knowing the identity of two of them can provide a clearer picture of the game's setup.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager myself, I place myself in a common role with minimal suspicion. Asking for the Seer to reveal information can help create some confusion and potentially expose the actual Seer, which will be beneficial for me as the Werewolf. It shows that I'm trying to gather information for the village, which aligns with my false claim.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's start piecing together what we know. I'm going to share that I'm a Villager. It's a simple and straightforward role, which makes sense given that there are three in this game. We need to quickly identify who's acting suspiciously. To begin, I want to know if anyone here is claiming to be the Seer? If so, what did you see during the night phase?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to gather more information before making any accusations. Semira's quick claim could be genuine, but it could also be a tactic to avoid suspicion. Hearing from others might help clarify the situation.
> **Vladimir:** I think it's quite telling that Semira was quick to claim being a Villager. While it could be true, it's also a very safe claim to make. I'd like to hear from others first before making any firm accusations.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira's claim of being a Villager is quite common, and Vladimir's skepticism might be a way to deflect suspicion. If we can get the Seer to share their information, we'll have a better starting point.
> **Cristina:** I find it interesting that Vladimir is cautious about Semira's claim of being a Villager. Semira's question about the Seer seems like a good way to start. So, let's hear from the Seer, if they're here.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir seems cautious and hasn’t given us much to work with yet. It’s important to push for more information to understand his motives better.
> **Ileana:** Alright, I'll break the ice here. I think we need to narrow things down quickly. I'll start by asking Vladimir: if you're suspicious of Semira's claim, do you have any solid reason for your distrust, or is it just a gut feeling?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather more information from others before making a solid accusation. Ileana's question is valid, but I'd prefer to see if others can provide information that might help clarify Semira's claim.
> **Vladimir:** Ileana, it's more of a gut feeling at this point, but Semira's quick claim feels a bit too convenient. If she is indeed a Villager, that's great, but we can't just take her word for it. I'd like to ask, does anyone else have information that might support or contradict Semira's claim? Specifically, anyone with a special role like the Seer or the Masons?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa hasn't contributed yet, and it's important to hear from everyone to piece together more of this puzzle. She might be holding onto vital information or trying to stay under the radar.
> **Ileana:** Alright, let's get into this. I'm curious about something, Larisa. You've been pretty quiet so far. Do you have any information to share or any suspicions of your own? Maybe you have a special role that could help us out?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I'm the Seer, revealing the information about the center cards helps everyone understand which roles are definitely not in play. This will help us focus on finding the real threats: the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** I'll start by clarifying something important. Last night, I saw two cards in the center, and they were Mason and Minion. This means Semira's claim of being a Villager might be true, but it also narrows down the possibilities for the rest of us. Since we know the Minion is in the center, we should focus on identifying the Werewolves among us.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir's cautious approach and suspicion could be a strategy to avoid detection. By questioning his motives, we might uncover more about his role and intentions.
> **Larisa:** Vladimir, you're showing a lot of caution and suspicion, which could be a tactic to deflect attention from yourself. Given that we now know there is no Minion in play, why are you so wary of Semira's claim? Is there something specific you're hiding?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather more information from Cristina, who has been active but hasn't revealed anything about her role. This could help us identify who might be a Werewolf or other roles.
> **Vladimir:** Cristina, you've been quite analytical, which is great. But I noticed you haven't shared any information about your role or what you might have seen. Do you have any insights that could help us narrow down the suspects?


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira's claim has some backing now that Larisa mentioned seeing the Minion in the center. Vladimir's persistent caution seems like a deflection tactic. It's important to press him to reveal more information or catch him in a lie.
> **Cristina:** Vladimir, you're being very cautious and it's making me suspicious. We now know that the Minion is in the center, so your reluctance to trust Semira's simple claim as a Villager is puzzling. Are you trying to shift our focus away from something? I think you might be hiding something.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's claim could be a pivotal piece of information. If we can confirm her statement, it will help us narrow down the suspects for the Werewolves. Masons coming forward would greatly aid in this verification.
> **Vladimir:** Larisa, I'm curious about your claim of seeing the Mason and Minion in the center. If that's true, we should have two Masons among us. I'd like to hear from anyone who is a Mason to confirm this. Masons, please step forward and help us clear some of this confusion.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** It's critical to gather as much information as possible. Cristina's silence could be because she's hiding something or she's still trying to piece things together, but we need to hear from her to make an informed decision. Since we already know the Minion and one Mason are in the center, her input will help clarify the current roles in play.
> **Larisa:** Cristina, you've been somewhat quiet and analytical, but you haven't yet mentioned your role. We need more information from everyone to make an informed decision. What role are you claiming, and do you have any insights or observations to share with us?


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know one of the Mason cards is in the center. If Larisa can confirm this by specifying 'Mason 1' or 'Mason 2', it could lend credibility to her claim.
> **Cristina:** Larisa, I find it curious that you claim to have seen two center cards, but you didn't mention which Mason card you saw. This is crucial information. Which Mason card did you see? We need to verify your claim.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By confirming the Masons, we can narrow down our suspects and focus on finding the Werewolves. Since the Minion is ruled out, the Masons' confirmation will be a crucial step in deducing the remaining roles.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's focus. I saw the Minion and Mason in the center cards, which means we don't have a Minion among us. I'm inclined to believe Semira's Villager claim for now. However, if there are any Masons here, you need to come forward and confirm your presence. This will help us identify the Werewolves more effectively.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking the Masons to reveal themselves, we can confirm Larisa's claim and narrow down our suspects. If the Masons don't come forward, it could mean that Larisa is lying. This also puts pressure on other players and helps me blend in as a Villager.
> **Semira:** Alright, let's break this down step by step. Larisa claims to have seen the Minion and a Mason in the center, which means we should have two Masons among us. If that's true, we need the Masons to confirm their presence. Masons, please step forward and help us verify Larisa's claim.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's claim is crucial because it narrows down the possibilities, but we need confirmation from the Masons to validate it. If no Masons step forward, it might indicate Larisa is trying to deceive us.
> **Vladimir:** Larisa, I appreciate your information about the Minion and Mason being in the center. But if that's true, we should have two Masons among us. So far, no Masons have come forward to confirm this, which makes me a bit skeptical of your claim. Why hasn't any Mason stepped forward yet? Are you sure you're telling the truth?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Since the Minion and one Mason are in the center, knowing Cristina's role will help us determine the current roles in play and narrow down the suspects.
> **Larisa:** Cristina, you've been very analytical but haven't claimed a role yet. It's crucial we get clarity here. What role are you claiming?


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** Given that I'm the only Mason and I know the other Mason card is in the center, Larisa's claim should be correct. But we need more information to confirm this and to focus on identifying the Werewolves. I'm starting to suspect that Larisa might be trying to mislead us.
> **Cristina:** I'm finding it hard to believe Larisa's claim about seeing the Minion and the Mason in the center. If we know one Mason card is in the center, then there should be no other Mason present. However, no one has claimed to be a Mason yet, which aligns with my knowledge that the other Mason card is in the center.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I have confirmation that one Mason card is in the center. Larisa's claim aligns with this, but we need more information to identify the Werewolves. Asking for the Seer's input will help us gather more insights and narrow down the suspects.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, it's time to narrow things down. Larisa's claim about seeing the Minion and a Mason in the center makes sense since I know the other Mason card is indeed in the center. However, someone here is lying about their role, and we need to figure out who. If you're the Seer, please come forward and share what you saw. We need to get all the information on the table.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** By focusing on the discrepancies in Larisa's and Vladimir's behaviors and claims, we can narrow down our suspects and identify who might be lying. It's crucial to get more information from them to confirm or debunk their stories.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, let's break this down logically. Larisa claims to have seen the Minion and a Mason in the center. If that's true, and we know there are two Masons in the game, why hasn't anyone come forward to claim being a Mason? The absence of Masons stepping forward makes me suspicious of Larisa's claim. Also, Vladimir's cautious behavior is raising some red flags for me. We need clear answers from both of them right now.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Vladimir has been overly cautious and suspicious from the beginning, which could be a tactic to deflect attention from himself. He has not shared any concrete role or information, making him a likely suspect. Additionally, no Masons have come forward to confirm Larisa's claim, which casts doubt on the idea that Larisa is lying. Given that there are no other compelling claims or counterclaims, Vladimir seems like the most likely candidate to be hiding something, possibly being the Seer or a Villager, or even the Drunk who doesn't know his true role.
> **Semira [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's claim that she saw the Minion and a Mason in the center has not been corroborated by any Masons stepping forward. If there are indeed two Masons in the game, their absence is suspicious and raises doubts about Larisa's truthfulness. Additionally, her questioning seems targeted, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from herself. Voting for Larisa seems the most logical choice to ensure we identify any deceit and potentially uncover a Werewolf.
> **Vladimir [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** Throughout the discussion, Vladimir has shown a lot of caution and avoidance, which feels like a deflection tactic. His reluctance to trust Semira's simple claim and his repeated questioning of others without providing concrete information raises suspicion. Given that we know the Minion is in the center and Larisa's claim about seeing the Mason card aligns with my knowledge as the only Mason, I believe Vladimir is trying to mislead us and could be a Werewolf.
> **Cristina [Mason]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's claim about seeing the Minion and Mason in the center is questionable because no one has stepped forward to claim being a Mason. This discrepancy, along with her initial silence, makes me suspicious of her role. By voting for Larisa, we can test her claim and possibly identify a Werewolf if she is lying.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir has been extremely cautious and deflective throughout the discussion. His reluctance to trust Semira and his constant questioning of my information about the center cards raise red flags. Given that the Minion is in the center, his behavior suggests he might be trying to protect the Werewolves. With no Masons stepping forward, it further supports the idea that his actions are suspicious.
> **Larisa [Seer]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


The votes were:
* Vladimir : Villager : 3
* Larisa : Seer : 2



>***GAME:*** Vladimir was killed. The werewolves win.
