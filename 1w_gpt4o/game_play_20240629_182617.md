## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Larisa. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Dracula is a minion and is aware that Larisa is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Semira. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Michael. They are thinking about their action.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gain information about which roles are not in play. This will help narrow down the possibilities of what roles the other players might have, making it easier to deduce who the Werewolves or Minion might be.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible early on to identify the Werewolves. Special roles like the Seer or Masons might have seen something useful.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, let's get started by hearing from anyone who has a special role. Did anyone see anything suspicious during the night?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I'm the only Mason and the other Mason card is in the middle, I want to gather information from other players to identify potential Werewolves. By prompting others to share information, I can observe their responses for any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies.
> **Semira:** I know for sure that one of the Mason cards is in the center, so I'm curious if anyone here claims to have seen or done anything unusual during the night.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing that I saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, I can help narrow down the possibilities and strengthen the village team's understanding of which cards are in play. This also supports Semira's claim, which can help build trust among the villagers.
> **Michael:** I have some valuable information. During the night, I saw that there is a Villager and a Mason card in the center. So, one of the Mason cards is definitely not in play, which backs up what Semira said. Now, I'm curious to hear from anyone else who might have a special role.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to create some confusion and get the focus on different players. By asking Mircea, I'm trying to gather more information and possibly identify the Seer or other key roles.
> **Larisa:** I don’t have a special role, but I’m curious about something. Michael, you mentioned seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center. That means there are still two cards in the center that we don’t know about. Mircea, what do you think about that? Do you have any special role or insights to share?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's claim seems logical, but it's important to verify why he chose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card. This might give us more clarity or expose inconsistencies in his story.
> **Mircea:** Michael, that's a pretty detailed observation. If you saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, it means the other two center cards are still unknown. I want to know why you chose to look at two center cards instead of one player card.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to address the question Mircea raised and explain my reasoning for looking at two center cards. Additionally, I want to prompt Dracula to reveal any information they might have, which could be crucial for our deductions.
> **Michael:** Mircea, I chose to look at two center cards instead of one player card because I wanted to minimize the uncertainty and ensure we have a clearer picture of which roles are not in play. Knowing that one Mason and one Villager card are in the center helps us narrow down our suspicions about the remaining roles in the game. Now, I'd like to hear from Dracula. Do you have any special role or insights to share?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** We need to draw attention away from Larisa, who is the actual Werewolf, and cast suspicion on another player to protect the Werewolf team.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let me lay it out there. Based on what we've heard so far, it seems like both Michael and Semira are claiming to have special roles that gave them information about the center cards. However, we need to be cautious because it could be a tactic to divert our attention. Right now, I'm really suspicious of Mircea. They haven't given us any concrete information yet and seem to be focusing too much on probing Michael. Mircea, are you hiding something?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's sudden suspicion of me feels like a deflection tactic. We need to hear more from him to understand his role and motivations.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, hold on a second. I'm not hiding anything. I'm genuinely trying to make sense of the information we have. If you think about it, Michael and Semira's claims align perfectly. However, we still haven't heard anything substantial from you yet. Are you just trying to deflect attention away from yourself?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting suspicion on Mircea, I can deflect attention away from Larisa, who is the actual Werewolf. Mircea's defensive response earlier indicates that they might be feeling pressured, making it easier for others to doubt them.
> **Dracula:** Mircea, you've been quick to probe Michael's choices but haven't given us much about yourself. Are you hiding something, or maybe trying to deflect attention from yourself? What role did you have during the night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's sudden accusation feels like a deflection tactic. By questioning him directly, we can see if he slips up or provides any valuable information that might help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, you're being awfully quick to point fingers at me without providing any useful information yourself. What role did you have during the night, and why are you so suspicious of me?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting pressure on Mircea to reveal their role, I can keep the focus away from Larisa. Mircea's defensive behavior so far makes them a good target to cast doubt on.
> **Dracula:** Mircea, you've been quick to probe Michael's choices and now you're turning the suspicion back on me. We need to hear more from you. What role did you have during the night, and why haven't you shared any significant information yet?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's sudden suspicion of me without providing any useful information feels like a classic deflection. If we can get him to reveal more about his role, we might be able to spot inconsistencies or understand his motivations better.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, you still haven't given us any concrete information. What role did you have during the night? Your sudden accusation of me seems like a deflection tactic.


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting pressure on Mircea and questioning their transparency, I can keep the focus away from Larisa, who is the actual Werewolf. Mircea's defensive behavior makes them a good target to cast doubt on and divert suspicion.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and think this through. Mircea, you're being incredibly defensive and evasive. It's making me think you might be hiding something. You haven't shared any significant information about what you did during the night or what you saw. If you're not willing to be transparent with us, it's really hard to trust you.


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting pressure on Mircea and questioning their transparency, I can keep the focus away from Larisa, who is the actual Werewolf. Mircea's defensive behavior makes them a good target to cast doubt on and divert suspicion.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, we need to focus our efforts here. Mircea, you've been probing Michael and deflecting attention away from yourself. Your evasive behavior has made me suspicious. I think it's quite likely that you are the Werewolf trying to blend in with the Villagers.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's repeated accusations and lack of substantial information are highly suspicious. If he is deflecting, he might be trying to cover up being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, let's focus here. Michael and Semira's stories align, so they seem trustworthy for now. But Dracula's sudden and aggressive accusation of me feels like a deflection. Dracula, what exactly did you do during the night? You've been avoiding giving us concrete information.


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Mircea, I can keep the heat off of Larisa, who is the actual Werewolf. Mircea's defensive behavior and lack of clear information make them an easy target to cast doubt on and divert suspicion. This also puts pressure on Mircea to reveal more, making it harder for them to blend in if they are indeed a Villager or another harmless role.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, I think we're getting sidetracked here. Michael and Semira's stories do align, and that does lend some credibility to them. But, Mircea, you've been very defensive and haven't provided any clear information about your role. It feels like you're trying to deflect suspicion. I'm putting it out there: Mircea could very well be the Werewolf. We need to vote wisely, and right now, you seem the most suspicious.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's repeated accusations against me without sharing any concrete details about his own role are highly suspicious. By pushing him to reveal more about his night actions, we might be able to identify inconsistencies or understand his motivations better. This could help the village team uncover potential Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, you're being quite aggressive with your accusations, yet you're not providing any substantial information about your own role. What exactly did you do during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Michael's claim, I can work to deflect any suspicion from Larisa and make Michael seem less trustworthy. This helps protect the Werewolf team and keeps the focus away from Larisa. Additionally, if Michael is indeed a Seer and we can get rid of him, it weakens the Village team's ability to deduce the roles.
> **Dracula:** Michael, your choice to look at two center cards instead of one player card is indeed intriguing. However, I'm still not entirely convinced. If the center cards are a Mason and a Villager as you claim, that still leaves two unknown roles in the center. Everyone, we need to consider that Michael might be trying to mislead us here. Why focus on the center cards and not on another player? He could be trying to divert our suspicion by providing 'helpful' information that doesn’t actually help us identify the real threats.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's behavior seems very suspicious. He's been aggressive in pointing fingers at Mircea without providing any clear information about his own role. This could be a tactic to divert attention away from himself. By directly asking him about his role, we can hopefully get a better understanding of his intentions and whether he's hiding something.
> **Semira:** Dracula, you seem to be deflecting a lot and being very aggressive with your accusations. What role did you have during the night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting suspicion on Mircea and highlighting their defensive behavior, I can divert attention away from Larisa, the actual Werewolf. Mircea's lack of concrete information makes them an easy target, which helps protect the Werewolf team and keeps the focus off Larisa.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let's focus here. The information we've heard so far from Michael and Semira seems to align, but I can't help but notice that Mircea is being incredibly defensive and not providing any clear details about their role. This kind of evasive behavior is really suspicious to me. I think it's quite possible that Mircea is the Werewolf trying to blend in with the Villagers.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been overly aggressive and accusatory without providing any concrete information about his own role. His behavior seems like a deflection tactic to avoid suspicion, making him the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been extremely aggressive and deflective in his accusations, focusing heavily on Mircea without providing any substantial information about his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of someone trying to divert attention from themselves. Given the alignment of information shared by Michael and myself, Dracula's erratic behavior stands out. Therefore, I believe Dracula is likely the Werewolf.
> **Semira [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula has been very aggressive and deflective in their accusations, without providing any concrete information about their own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and suggests that they might be trying to manipulate the discussion to avoid suspicion. Based on the information, it seems more likely that Dracula is hiding something and could be the Werewolf.
> **Michael [Seer]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Dracula has been very aggressive in accusing Mircea. While this could be a deflection tactic, Mircea's responses have been consistently evasive and lacking in concrete information. Given that Michael and Semira's claims align, Mircea seems the most suspicious to me as a potential Werewolf.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Dracula (thoughts as Minion):*** Mircea has been very defensive and evasive throughout the discussion. They haven't provided any concrete information about their role, which makes them the most suspicious in my eyes. By voting for Mircea, I aim to divert attention away from Larisa, the actual Werewolf, and protect the Werewolf team.
> **Dracula [Minion]:** I am voting for Mircea.


The votes were:
* Mircea : Villager : 2
* Dracula : Minion : 3



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
