## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Lucian. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dragos. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Vladimir. They are thinking about their action.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gain information about roles that are not in play. This will help narrow down the possibilities for who might be a Werewolf or Minion among the players. Additionally, if I find a Werewolf or Minion in the center, I can confidently state that they are not in play, which will aid the Village team in identifying the true threats.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to gather information early in the day phase. By asking who has seen something, we can potentially identify the Seer or Masons, who can provide crucial information for identifying the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Let's get this started. Who here claims to have seen something useful during the night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I'm the only Mason, we can use this information to help identify who might be lying about their roles. Let's see who's willing to claim what roles and catch any inconsistencies.
> **Dragos:** I'm a Mason, and I didn't see another Mason last night. This means the other Mason card is in the center.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** If Dragos confirms, it suggests there are more Village roles in the center, making it more likely that the roles left in play include Seer or Minion. This helps me gauge which roles might be in the game and whom to suspect or align with.
> **Lucian:** Dragos, are you sure you didn't see another Mason? Because if you didn't, that means there are two Masons in the center, which would be a bit unusual given the distribution of roles. So, just double-checking: are you absolutely positive you didn't see another Mason?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian's question seems to be probing for consistency. By affirming my statement confidently, I want to ensure there's no doubt about my role and to see how Lucian responds. Maybe he's trying to test the waters or throw suspicion off himself.
> **Dragos:** Lucian, I'm absolutely positive I didn't see another Mason. Since there's only one Mason in the game and that's me, the other Mason card must be in the center.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to gather more information from others without revealing too much about myself. By asking if anyone else saw something, I encourage players to disclose their roles or actions, which helps me identify potential threats or allies. This also creates a sense of unity and distracts from my role as the Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** Alright, if Dragos is claiming to be the only Mason and didn't see another one, then we can probably rule out the Mason pair theory. But that leaves us with a few possibilities. Someone here could be a Minion trying to protect the Werewolf, or we might have a Seer who saw something important. I'm curious, did anyone else see or do anything interesting last night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's insistence on verifying Dragos' claim about the Mason role seems a bit suspicious. If Lucian has a specific role that involves more information or if he's trying to sow confusion, this could help identify his true intentions.
> **Larisa:** Alright, Lucian, you seem quite concerned about the Mason issue. Could you clarify what role you have and why you're so interested in verifying Dragos' claim?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question to Vladimir, I can gauge his response and see if there's any inconsistency or useful information that might help me steer suspicion away from myself. It's important to keep the conversation moving and involve other players while maintaining my Villager facade.
> **Lucian:** Alright, I think it's time we start piecing things together. I'm a Villager, and I'm just trying to get a clear picture of the roles at play. Dragos mentioned he didn't see another Mason, which is interesting. I'd like to hear from Vladimir next. Vladimir, can you tell us what you did or saw last night? Any information could help us narrow down our suspects.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the roles I saw in the center, I can confirm Dragos' claim, which helps us narrow down the suspects. This information should steer the conversation towards identifying the Werewolf or Minion among the remaining players.
> **Vladimir:** I have some crucial information to share. Last night, I looked at two of the center cards, and I saw a Villager and a Mason. This means that Dragos is indeed telling the truth about being the only Mason, as the other Mason card is in the center. Therefore, we can trust Dragos. Now, we need to focus on finding the Werewolf or the Minion.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to gather more information from everyone to narrow down the suspects. Kraven hasn't spoken yet, so it's important to hear from them to see if they can provide any useful information or if their story seems suspicious.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, Kraven, you've been quiet so far. What did you do or see last night? We need all the information we can get to piece this together.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Since we have established that Dragos is likely telling the truth about being the lone Mason, we need to shift our focus to finding the Werewolves or Minion. Gathering more information will help us identify any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, it seems like we have some solid information on the Masons. So, let's focus on the other roles. Has anyone seen any suspicious activity or cards that might point us to the Werewolf or the Minion?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Vladimir claims to have seen two center cards, we need to address the uncertainty surrounding the third card. His response will help us determine if he's being truthful or trying to deceive us.
> **Kraven:** Vladimir, you claim to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, but that leaves us with one more center card unaccounted for. What do you think that last card could be, and why didn't you check it?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian has been actively questioning others but hasn't provided much insight about their own role or suspicions. By directing the conversation to them, we might gather more information or catch inconsistencies in their story.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, we know that Dragos is the only Mason and we have one more Villager in the center. This leaves us with two unknown roles: the Werewolf and the Minion. If we assume the last center card is a Villager, we need to focus on identifying the Werewolf and Minion among us. Lucian, you've been quick to question others. Can you tell us more about your thoughts and any suspicions you might have?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven has been quiet, and his role is still unknown. By putting him on the spot, I can gather more information and potentially steer suspicion away from myself. Also, involving him will help keep the focus off me and might reveal inconsistencies or useful details.
> **Lucian:** Alright, it seems like we're making some progress here. Vladimir, you mentioned seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center, which aligns with Dragos' claim of being the only Mason. But that leaves one more card in the center unaccounted for. Given this information, we need to evaluate each of our roles carefully. Kraven, you have been a bit quiet. You haven't shared your role yet. Can you please tell us what you did or saw last night? We need every piece of information to make the right decision.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been very adamant about clarifying Dragos' claim, which is already substantiated by Vladimir. This behavior seems suspicious and could indicate that Lucian is trying to divert attention from himself or his potential allies.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, I find it interesting that you're pressing so hard on the Mason issue when Vladimir already confirmed it. Are you deflecting attention away from something? What did you really see or do last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting pressure on Kraven, who has been quiet and evasive, we might expose inconsistencies or force him to reveal useful information. This will help shift suspicion away from me and onto him, making it more likely that the others will target him instead of me.
> **Lucian:** I find it interesting that Kraven is still being evasive about his role. Given that Vladimir has confirmed seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center, we know that there are some roles still unaccounted for. Kraven, you've been deflecting questions and avoiding sharing information. Are you the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf, or could you be the Werewolf yourself?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's persistent questioning of the Mason issue, despite confirmation, raises suspicion. He might be trying to deflect attention from himself or his allies. Getting a clearer answer from him could help us identify his true role.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, you've been pressing hard on the Mason issue even after Vladimir confirmed Dragos' claim. This seems like a strategy to divert attention. Are you hiding something? What did you really see or do last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to steer the conversation towards identifying the Werewolf or Minion without drawing attention to myself. By summarizing the information and highlighting the unknown center card, I can keep the focus on finding the Werewolf or Minion while avoiding suspicion.
> **Lucian:** I've been trying to piece together the information we have so far. Dragos claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which Vladimir supports by seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center. This leaves us with one unknown center card. Given the roles in play, it's possible that it could be a Villager, but it could also be the Seer or Minion. We need to focus on identifying the Werewolf or Minion among us. So, let's think carefully about who has been the most evasive or suspicious.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven has not shared any information about his role or actions, which is making him appear very suspicious. Pressing him for details can help us get a clearer picture of the roles at play and potentially identify any inconsistencies.
> **Dragos:** Kraven, you've been suspiciously quiet and evasive. What exactly did you do or see last night? We need transparency to figure out who the Werewolf is.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been consistently questioning the Mason issue, even after Vladimir confirmed Dragos' claim. This behavior seems like an attempt to deflect attention, making him a prime suspect for being the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Kraven:** Alright, Lucian, you've been pushing hard on the Mason issue, but what about your own actions last night? I find your behavior quite suspicious. Are you trying to divert attention for a reason?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven's evasiveness and recent attempts to deflect suspicion towards me raise red flags. By pressing him to reveal his actions, I hope to either catch him in a lie or divert attention away from myself. This keeps the focus on him and maintains my Villager facade.
> **Lucian:** Kraven, let's put everything on the table. You've been quiet and evasive, and now you're turning the suspicion towards me. What did you do or see last night? We need transparency to figure out who the Werewolf or Minion is.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been insistent on questioning the Mason issue even after it was confirmed by Vladimir, which seems like a deflection tactic. Given that he has also been evasive about his own role, Lucian appears to be the most suspicious and could likely be the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven has been consistently evasive and has not provided any information about his role or actions last night. This behavior is highly suspicious and suggests he might be the Werewolf or Minion trying to deflect attention away from himself. Given the information from Vladimir about the center cards and the consistency of my Mason claim, Kraven seems the most likely candidate to be deceitful.
> **Dragos [Mason]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven has been evasive and quiet throughout the discussion, only deflecting suspicion towards others without providing any useful information about his own role. This behavior aligns with the characteristics of either a Minion or a Werewolf trying to stay under the radar. Given that the other players have provided more concrete information, it is best to vote for Kraven to increase our chances of eliminating a threat to the village.
> **Lucian [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been quiet and evasive throughout the entire discussion. While Dragos and Vladimir's claims align with each other, and Lucian has been consistent in questioning the information, Kraven has not provided any solid information about his role or actions. His behavior raises suspicion that he could be hiding something, possibly being the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Larisa [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian has been very aggressive in questioning others and redirecting attention, which is often a tactic used by someone trying to deflect suspicion from themselves. Given that Dragos is confirmed as the Mason and I confirmed seeing a Villager and another Mason in the center, it leaves Lucian and Kraven as potential Werewolves or Minion. Lucian's behavior has been the most suspicious, so my vote goes to Lucian.
> **Vladimir [Seer]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Kraven : Villager : 3
* Lucian : Werewolf : 2



>***GAME:*** Kraven was killed. The werewolves win.
