## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** By asking for Masons or Seers to step forward, I'm trying to get the real Villagers and special roles to reveal themselves. This will help me identify the true threats to the Werewolf team so we can focus on eliminating them.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, let's get things started. I'm a Villager, and I think it's crucial we establish some initial trust. Can anyone confidently claim to be a Mason or Seer and share what they saw or did last night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** We need some concrete information to start making informed decisions. Knowing who the Seer or Masons are can help us identify potential Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, since Alexia claimed to be a Villager, we need to hear from someone with a more definitive role. Can the Seer or a Mason please step forward and share what they saw?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Alexia and Alexandra, I'm hoping to shift the focus away from myself. Plus, if I can create some tension between them, it might make them look more suspicious, and I can avoid being scrutinized.
> **Dragos:** Alright, I think it's important that we start making some definitive claims. Alexia and Alexandra are both being very cautious. I understand the need for Masons or the Seer to reveal themselves, but why haven't they done so already? This makes me wonder if one of them might be trying to stay under the radar.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos is questioning others for being cautious, which could be an attempt to shift suspicion. It's time to put some pressure on Dragos and see how he responds.
> **Dracula:** Alright, Dragos, you seem to be questioning why no Masons or Seers have revealed themselves yet. Are you trying to divert attention away from yourself? Why don’t you tell us what role you have?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By stating that I'm a Villager and expressing suspicion about Alexia and Alexandra, I'm trying to deflect attention away from myself. Targeting Alexandra specifically might make her defensive and less likely to accuse me, while also stirring some doubt about her role among the other players.
> **Dragos:** Alright Dracula, fair enough. I'll come clean. I'm actually a Villager. I wanted to see how people would react to the initial claims and I'm seeing a lot of caution here, which makes me think there might be some hidden roles among us. Since no Masons or Seer have stepped forward, I'm starting to get suspicious. Alexia and Alexandra, you both were quick to ask for revelations but haven't given much yourselves, especially you, Alexandra.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's deflection towards Dragos feels like a way to avoid revealing his own role. We need more information from him to gauge his intentions.
> **Alexandra:** Dracula, you've been pretty quiet so far. Why haven't you claimed a role yet? Are you hiding something?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** By questioning Dragos directly, we can gauge his reaction and possibly deduce more about his intentions. His defensiveness and quickness to accuse others are suspicious behaviors that need to be addressed.
> **Dracula:** Alright, Dragos, you've declared yourself as a Villager, but I noticed you were quick to cast suspicion on Alexia and Alexandra for not revealing anything definitive. This seems a bit defensive to me. Why are you so eager to point fingers without giving us more solid information?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By openly accusing Alexia and Alexandra, I'm hoping to create enough suspicion around them to divert attention away from myself. This will also pressure them into making a definitive move, which could reveal more about their roles and help me identify who to target for the vote.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, I think it's time we stop beating around the bush. Alexia and Alexandra, both of you were quick to call for a Seer or Mason to step forward, yet neither of you has provided any solid information about your own roles. This cautious behavior is making me very suspicious. Could it be that you two are trying to manipulate the rest of us? I'm inclined to believe that one of you might be a Werewolf. We need to get to the bottom of this.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know for sure that there is no other Mason card in play. Dragos claiming Villager while Alexia and Alexandra also claimed Villager makes it suspicious. We need to confront him to uncover the truth.
> **Marius:** Alright, everyone, listen up. We need to get to the bottom of this. Since I'm a Mason and I know the other Mason card is in the center, I can confirm that Dragos is definitely lying about being a Villager. Dragos, why are you trying to mislead us?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Marius's bold claim and suggesting that his accusation might be a diversion tactic, I'm aiming to undermine his credibility and shift the suspicion back on him. This move also buys me time as a Werewolf to avoid being targeted.
> **Dragos:** Marius, your claim about being a Mason is quite bold. If you're truly a Mason, then who is the other Mason? You said the other Mason card is in the center, but that doesn't explain why you're accusing me so quickly. I think you're trying to cover something up. Everyone, don't you find it suspicious that Marius suddenly comes out with this information now? It feels like a desperate attempt to divert suspicion. Marius, can you explain why we should trust you?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know that I can only trust myself for now. Dragos's defensive behavior and attempt to shift the blame onto me suggests he may be hiding something, possibly being a Werewolf or Minion. Confronting him directly could reveal more information and help the Villagers.
> **Marius:** Dragos, your response feels defensive and evasive. You challenged me as if I'm hiding something, but I have no reason to lie about being a Mason. Let's focus on why you're being so defensive. If you're truly a Villager, you should help us find the Werewolves instead of casting doubt on my genuine claim.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Alexia and making her justify her initial claim, I can divert the focus away from myself while also putting pressure on her to provide more information. If she hesitates or fumbles, it could make her look suspicious and take some heat off me.
> **Dragos:** Alexia, you were the first to claim being a Villager, but you haven't given us any more information since then. If you're truly a Villager, you should have some insights by now. What do you think about Marius's claim of being a Mason? Do you agree with him, or do you think he might be hiding something?


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** Marius's sudden claim of being a Mason, especially after Dragos's accusations, feels suspicious. By casting doubt on Marius, I aim to protect Dragos, the known werewolf, and direct suspicion away from him.
> **Alexia:** Marius, I'm finding it hard to take your claim at face value. You say you're a Mason and that the other Mason card is in the center, but there's something that doesn't sit right with me. If you were truly a Mason, why wait so long to reveal this critical information? It almost feels like a last-ditch effort to divert attention from yourself. I'm starting to think you might be the Werewolf here, trying to throw us off your scent.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to gather more information from Alexandra. She's been very cautious and hasn't claimed any role yet, which could make her suspicious. By directly questioning her, we might get more clues about her true identity.
> **Marius:** Alexandra, you’ve been pretty quiet and mostly questioning Dracula. You haven't mentioned your own role yet. What role do you claim to have?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been questioning everyone else's roles without offering much concrete evidence or insight into his own role. His behavior is suspicious and could indicate he is trying to divert attention away from himself.
> **Alexandra:** Dragos, you're being very defensive and aggressive in your questioning. You're quick to cast suspicion on others, but you haven't provided any solid evidence for your claims. Why should we trust you?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I'm trying to deflect suspicion from myself by questioning the lack of transparency from others. By targeting Alexia and Alexandra, I aim to create doubt about their roles and divert attention away from me. This also pressures them to reveal more information, potentially leading to inconsistencies that I can exploit.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and evaluate the situation. Marius has come forward claiming to be a Mason, but we haven't seen any confirmation from another Mason or any other solid proof. Meanwhile, Alexia and Alexandra are still very quiet about their roles, which is suspicious to me. We need more transparency here. Alexia, Alexandra, can either of you provide more information about your roles?


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** Marius's sudden claim of being a Mason feels like a desperate move to divert suspicion. By casting doubt on him, I'm trying to protect Dragos, the known Werewolf, and direct suspicion away from him.
> **Alexia:** Marius, your claim of being the only Mason is highly suspicious to me. If you're truly a Mason, why wouldn't you reveal this information sooner? It's almost as if you're trying to buy time to formulate a story. I'm inclined to believe you might be the Werewolf trying to throw us off.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly questioning Alexandra, who has been quiet and cautious, we might get more clues about her true identity. If she's a Villager or a Seer, she should be able to provide useful information. If she hesitates or deflects, it could indicate she's hiding something.
> **Marius:** Alexandra, you've been very cautious and haven't claimed a role yet. What role do you claim to have?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos' defensive behavior and aggressive questioning without providing solid evidence make him seem very suspicious. Marius' claim about being a Mason, though unverifiable, seems more credible given the lack of other Mason claims. We need to focus our attention on Dragos.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's consider the facts. Marius has claimed to be a Mason, but we have no way to verify that claim unless another Mason steps forward. Dragos has been very defensive and aggressive in his questioning, which makes me suspicious. I'm inclined to believe that Dragos might be the Werewolf here.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been aggressively accusing others, which is a common tactic used by Werewolves to divert attention away from themselves. By questioning him directly, I hope to either expose inconsistencies in his story or put pressure on him to reveal more information that could clarify his role.
> **Alexandra:** Dragos, your defensive and aggressive behavior in questioning others, without providing solid evidence, makes me very suspicious of you. Why are you so quick to cast doubt on everyone else without giving us anything concrete?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** Marius's sudden claim of being a Mason feels suspicious, especially since no other Mason has stepped forward to confirm his claim. By focusing the vote on Marius, we can protect Dragos, the known Werewolf, and increase the chances of the Werewolf team winning.
> **Alexia [Minion]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been very defensive and aggressive in his questioning, which suggests he's trying to divert attention away from himself. Marius's claim of being a Mason makes more sense given the lack of other Mason claims. Dragos's behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with tactics commonly used by Werewolves.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Marius's claim of being the only Mason seemed like a last-minute attempt to divert suspicion. His bold accusation against me feels like a desperate move to cover his tracks. Additionally, Alexia and Alexandra have been more passive, which makes me less inclined to suspect them over Marius.
> **Dragos [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been defensive and aggressive, casting suspicion on others without providing solid evidence. Marius claiming to be a Mason and pointing out Dragos as lying about being a Villager adds credibility to Marius's claim. Given the interactions and Dragos's behavior, it's likely that Dragos is not on the village team.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos has been very defensive and aggressive in his questioning, which makes me suspicious. He claimed to be a Villager, but since I know I'm the only Mason and there's no other Mason to confirm, it's likely Dragos is hiding something. His behavior suggests he could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to deflect suspicion.
> **Marius [Mason]:** I am voting for Dragos.


The votes were:
* Dragos : Werewolf : 3
* Marius : Mason : 2



>***GAME:*** Dragos was killed. The villagers win.
