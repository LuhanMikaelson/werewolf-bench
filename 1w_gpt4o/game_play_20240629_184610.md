## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexandra. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Viktor is a minion and is aware that Alexandra is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Emil. They are thinking about their action.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can potentially identify which roles are not in play. This information can be very valuable during the discussion phase to deduce who might be lying about their roles or to confirm certain claims. It also helps to rule out the possibility of those roles being in the game, giving us a clearer picture of the remaining cards.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** If both Masons can confirm each other, we can narrow down our suspects and build trust within the village team.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, who wants to claim Mason?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** I saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, which means one of the Masons is not in play. This information can help us narrow down the roles and identify potential liars. Selene's question about the Mason is interesting because if someone falsely claims to be a Mason, we'll know they're lying.
> **Emil:** I didn't see a Mason when I checked the center cards, so it's possible one of the Masons is still in the center.


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** I'm trying to throw suspicion onto Emil to protect our Werewolf, Alexandra, and to divert attention from her. If people start doubting Emil, it reduces the risk of them uncovering the real Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** Hey everyone, I think Emil might be hiding something. If he really checked the center cards and didn't see a Mason, why didn't he mention what he did see? That seems a bit suspicious to me.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Emil's vague claim, I can cast doubt on him and divert attention away from me. If he truly is hiding something, it might be beneficial for my position as the lone Werewolf to push the suspicion onto him.
> **Alexandra:** Hmm, interesting. Emil, you said you checked the center cards but didn't see a Mason, right? Why didn't you mention which cards you did see? That seems a bit suspicious to me.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's reluctance to disclose the cards he saw in the center sounds suspicious. If he really looked at the center cards as he claimed, he should be able to provide more specific information. This might help us figure out if he's hiding something or if he's just a confused Villager.
> **Kraven:** Emil, you said you checked the center cards but didn't see a Mason. Can you tell us what you did see?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** It's important to clarify the information I have as a Seer to help the Villagers. Seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center means one of the Mason roles is not in play, which can help us identify potential liars and narrow down who the Werewolves might be.
> **Emil:** Alright, I guess it's time to come clean. I did check the center cards and saw a Mason and a Villager. That means one of the Mason cards is definitely in the center, and there's only one possible Mason among us.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's initial reluctance to share what he saw in the center cards raises suspicion. If he is indeed telling the truth now, it's important to understand why he didn't provide this information sooner.
> **Selene:** Emil, you mentioned that you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center cards. Why didn't you reveal this information earlier when Viktor and Alexandra asked you about it? It seems like you were holding back crucial information.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene's initial question about the Masons could be a strategic move to uncover information. If Selene is a Mason, she might be trying to identify her partner. If she's not, she might be trying to fish for information or throw us off. Understanding her motive can help us determine her role and whether she's being truthful.
> **Emil:** Selene, you're the one who initiated the discussion by asking about the Masons. Are you a Mason yourself, or did you have another reason for starting with that question?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's hesitation in revealing the center cards seems suspicious. If he really is a Villager, he should have been forthcoming with all the information. By pressing him, we might be able to catch him in a lie or see if his story changes, which could indicate he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Selene:** Emil, I find it really odd that you didn't reveal you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center right away. It feels like you're trying to hide something. Care to explain why you withheld that information?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor's immediate suspicion of me could be an attempt to deflect attention away from himself. If he reveals his role, it might help us determine if he's being truthful or if he's trying to deceive us.
> **Emil:** Viktor, you seem pretty eager to point fingers at me. If you're so sure I'm hiding something, why don't you tell us what role you have? Maybe that will clear things up for everyone.


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on both Emil and Selene, I aim to create confusion and divert attention away from Alexandra, who is the real Werewolf. This way, I can protect her while sowing discord among the Villagers.
> **Viktor:** I find it really odd that Emil didn't mention seeing the Mason and the Villager in the center right away. It seems like he was trying to hide something. And if Selene started the conversation about Masons, it makes me wonder if she was trying to divert attention from herself. I'm starting to suspect that Emil and Selene might be working together.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor's immediate suspicion of me might be an attempt to deflect attention away from himself. If he reveals his role, it might help us determine if he's being truthful or if he's trying to deceive us.
> **Emil:** Viktor, you seem to be pushing hard against me, which makes me suspicious. You haven't mentioned your role yet. Care to explain why you're so eager to accuse me without giving us any information about yourself?


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Selene on the spot, I'm hoping to further divert attention away from Alexandra and keep the focus on other players. If Selene stumbles or hesitates, it will make her seem more suspicious and keep the heat off Alexandra.
> **Viktor:** Selene, you seem very focused on Emil and his actions. If you're not a Mason, can you tell us what role you have? That might help clear things up.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's hesitation and initial reluctance to reveal what he saw in the center cards is suspicious. If he were truly on the village team, he should have been more forthcoming with this information. Pressing him on this could expose inconsistencies in his story and help us determine if he's hiding something, like being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Selene:** Emil, you didn't mention seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center right away, which is strange. Why the delay in sharing this crucial information?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor's immediate suspicion and continuous pressure on me without disclosing his own role makes me think he might be trying to divert attention. By pushing him to reveal his role, we can gather more information and see if his story adds up.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. Viktor has been really quick to accuse me without revealing his own role. Viktor, why are you so defensive? What role are you hiding?


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Selene on the spot and questioning her pushiness, we can create more confusion among the Villagers and divert attention away from Alexandra. If Selene hesitates or gives an inconsistent answer, it will make her seem more suspicious, which helps protect our Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone, we need to really consider what's going on here. Emil was quick to claim he saw the Mason and Villager in the center, but only after being pressed. This hesitation is suspicious. Selene was quick to jump on Emil, but hasn't revealed her role either. If we want to get to the bottom of this, we need transparency. Selene, what role do you have? Your pushiness makes me think you might be hiding something.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been very accusatory without providing any information about his own role. This behavior is suspicious and we need to get clarity on his role.
> **Selene:** Viktor, you seem really eager to deflect attention onto others. You keep pushing for roles without revealing yours. Care to share what your role is?


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Emil of being the Werewolf, I aim to create enough suspicion around him that the others will focus on him instead of Alexandra. Emil hesitating to reveal what he saw in the center cards provides an opportunity to paint him as the primary suspect, which can help protect our real Werewolf, Alexandra.
> **Viktor:** Alright, it seems like we've got a lot of accusations flying around, but not a lot of solid evidence. Emil, you claimed to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, but only after being pressed. That does seem a bit suspicious. Selene, you started the conversation about Masons, but you haven't revealed your role either. I still think Emil's actions are the most suspicious here. It's almost like he's trying to redirect the conversation away from himself. I think Emil might actually be the Werewolf here!


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Emil's delay in sharing information, I can create more doubt around him and divert attention away from Alexandra. This will also help keep the focus on Emil and prevent the other players from scrutinizing Alexandra too closely.
> **Viktor:** Emil, I think it's really suspicious that you only revealed seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center after being pressed by multiple people. Why weren't you upfront about it from the start?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor's continuous pressure on me without disclosing his own role makes me highly suspicious of him. If he reveals his role, it might either validate his claims or expose him as a liar.
> **Emil:** Viktor, you're being very aggressive in accusing me without revealing your own role. What are you hiding? If you're so sure I'm the Werewolf, tell us what role you have.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's hesitation and initial reluctance to reveal the center cards is highly suspicious. If he were truly a Villager, he should have been more forthcoming with the information. His inconsistent behavior suggests he might be hiding something, possibly being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor has been very aggressive in accusing me without revealing his own role. His continuous pressure without providing any information about himself makes him highly suspicious. Given the information I have as the Seer, I believe Viktor is likely to be hiding something and could be a Werewolf.
> **Emil [Seer]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** Emil's hesitation to reveal the center cards and his defensive behavior make him the most suspicious. By voting for Emil, I aim to protect Alexandra and increase the chances of a Werewolf win.
> **Viktor [Minion]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil's hesitation in revealing he saw a Mason and a Villager in the center after being pressed multiple times seems very suspicious. Additionally, his sudden revelation feels like a defensive move to divert attention. It's in my best interest as the Werewolf to vote for someone who is already under suspicion, and Emil fits that role perfectly.
> **Alexandra [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's reluctance to reveal the center cards initially and his defensive behavior when questioned multiple times make him the most suspicious player. His late disclosure of the center cards could indicate he is trying to hide his role as a Werewolf or Minion. Voting for Emil seems like the best move to help the village team win.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Emil : Seer : 4
* Viktor : Minion : 1



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The werewolves win.
