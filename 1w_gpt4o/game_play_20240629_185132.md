## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Semira. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Vladimir and Dragos. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Larisa. They are thinking about their action.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me more information about the roles that are not in play, which can help identify false claims and deduce who the Werewolves and other roles might be.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By prompting the Masons to reveal themselves, we can potentially identify two villagers, which will help us narrow down our suspicions towards the other roles. Additionally, this can set a framework for further discussion and accusations, allowing me to blend in and gather more information.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's start by sharing what we saw or did during the night. I think we should hear from the Masons first to confirm their identities.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing the two roles I saw in the center helps narrow down the possibilities of who might be lying about their roles. Knowing the Minion is in the center prevents false claims and makes it easier to identify the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** I think it's important for everyone to know that I saw the Minion and a Villager in the center. This means that there's no Minion and at least one less Villager in the game.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to start pinpointing roles to narrow down who the Werewolf might be.
> **Emil:** Vladimir, what role did you have last night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, it's important to establish trust among the villagers quickly. By revealing myself and confirming Dragos as my fellow Mason, I can help narrow down the potential suspects. This also means that Dragos and I are both definitely on the village team.
> **Vladimir:** I'm a Mason and so is Dragos. We both saw each other last night.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** It's important to confirm Larisa's claim about the Minion and Villager in the center to ensure she is telling the truth. This can narrow down the roles that are actually in play and help identify potential Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Larisa, you said you saw the Minion and a Villager in the center. Can you specify which exact cards you saw in the center?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Reiterating the information about the roles in the center helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and prevents anyone from falsely claiming to be the Minion. It also narrows down the possible roles in play.
> **Larisa:** I think it's important to know that the Minion and one Villager are in the center, like I mentioned before. This means there's no Minion in play, and one less Villager to worry about.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** It's crucial to confirm the exact center cards to verify her claim and potentially identify if she's trying to deceive us.
> **Dragos:** Larisa, can you clarify which exact center cards you saw? You first mentioned the Minion and a Villager, but now you're being vague. I need to know the specifics.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to confirm the Mason claim to ensure that Vladimir and Dragos are telling the truth. If their claims hold, we can trust them as Villagers and narrow down who might be the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Dragos, I want to hear your confirmation on being a Mason with Vladimir. Did you see Vladimir last night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** It's important to get the exact cards Larisa saw in the center to verify her claim and see if it lines up with the information we have so far. If she is vague or inconsistent, it might indicate she is trying to deceive us.
> **Dragos:** Yes, I can confirm that Vladimir and I are Masons. We both saw each other last night. Now, let's focus on Larisa's claim. Larisa, you mentioned seeing the Minion and a Villager in the center, but you didn't specify which exact cards. Can you please clarify?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to gather more information to piece together the roles in play. Emil hasn't spoken much, and we need to hear his role to assess the situation better and identify any inconsistencies in the claims.
> **Larisa:** Emil, I'd like to hear what role you claim to be. We've heard from the Masons, and I've shared what I saw in the center. It's important for us to get everyone's claims on the table.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa initially mentioned seeing the Minion and a Villager in the center but has been repeating this without specifying which exact cards she viewed. If she is being unclear, it might be a sign that she's trying to mislead us.
> **Emil:** Larisa, you're being a bit vague with your claim about the center cards. Can you clearly confirm which exact cards you saw in the center?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil has been quiet and non-committal, which is suspicious. His role claim could help us identify inconsistencies and narrow down the suspects.
> **Larisa:** Emil, it's crucial that you clarify your role now. We're running out of time and we need to piece everything together.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa keeps repeating the same information without giving specifics. If she's being intentionally vague, she might be hiding something. We need to get more precise information from her to determine whether she's trustworthy or not.
> **Emil:** Larisa, you've been pretty vague about which exact center cards you saw. If you really are the Seer, you should be able to specify the exact positions of the Minion and Villager in the center. Can you do that?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil has been deflecting questions and has not provided any clear information about his role. Since he keeps questioning my claims, it’s important to get him to state his role so we can identify any inconsistencies and potentially narrow down the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Emil, you still haven't told us your role. This is crucial information for us to piece together the rest of the game. Please clarify what role you had last night.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's vagueness and repetition of the same information without specifics is suspicious. If she's truly the Seer, she should be able to give us precise information about the positions of the Minion and Villager in the center cards. This will help us determine her trustworthiness and narrow down the suspects.
> **Emil:** Larisa, you keep repeating that you saw the Minion and a Villager in the center, but you've been very vague about which exact cards you saw. If you're really the Seer, you should be able to tell us the exact positions of the Minion and Villager in the center. So, can you specify the exact positions?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil has been deflecting and avoiding giving any information about his role, which is highly suspicious. His reluctance to share makes me suspect he might be hiding something. I need to press him to reveal his role so we can identify any inconsistencies and potentially narrow down the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Emil, you still haven't told us your role. Given the time we have left, we need your answer now. What role did you have last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's lack of specificity is suspicious. If she truly is the Seer, she should be able to provide more details to back up her claim. Pinning her down on this could help verify her role or expose any deception.
> **Emil:** Larisa, you've been very vague about which exact center cards you saw and their positions. If you're really the Seer, you should be able to tell us the exact positions of the Minion and Villager in the center. So, can you specify the exact positions?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil has been deliberately vague and deflective in all his responses. He hasn't given any information about his role and has been focused on questioning me. This behavior is consistent with someone trying to hide their identity as a Werewolf.
> **Larisa:** Emil, your silence and deflection are highly suspicious. You keep avoiding sharing your role and keep questioning my Seer claim. This makes me think you're hiding something. I believe you might be the Werewolf!


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's consistent vagueness about the exact positions of the Minion and Villager in the center is suspicious. If she's truly the Seer, she should be able to provide more precise details. Pinning her down on this could help verify her role or expose any deception.
> **Emil:** Larisa, you've been very persistent about me revealing my role, which is understandable. But your vagueness about the exact positions of the Minion and Villager in the center is suspicious. If you're truly the Seer, you should be able to provide those positions. So, can you specify which exact positions you saw the Minion and Villager in the center?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil has been deflecting questions and has not provided any clear information about his role. His reluctance to share makes me suspect he might be hiding something. By accusing him, we can see how others react and gather more information to make an informed decision.
> **Larisa:** Emil, at this point, your reluctance to reveal your role is highly suspicious. I think you might be trying to hide that you're the Werewolf. Your constant deflection and questioning of my Seer claim without providing any information yourself makes me believe you're hiding something. Everyone, I believe Emil is the Werewolf!

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa's consistent questioning of Emil and his reluctance to reveal his role make him highly suspicious. If Emil is indeed hiding something, it could mean he is the Werewolf. Voting for him seems like the best course of action to divert suspicion from myself and potentially eliminate a threat.
> **Semira [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil has been highly suspicious throughout the discussion by deflecting questions and avoiding revealing his role. His reluctance to share information and constant questioning of my Seer claim without providing any clear answers himself make me believe he is hiding something. Given the information we have, I believe Emil is the Werewolf.
> **Larisa [Seer]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's consistent vagueness and avoidance of providing specific details about the center cards make her claim as the Seer suspicious. If she were truly the Seer, she would be able to provide the exact positions of the Minion and Villager in the center. Her behavior suggests she might be trying to mislead us, potentially as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Given that I am a Mason and Dragos has confirmed the same, we can both be trusted. Larisa claimed to be the Seer and saw the Minion and a Villager in the center, but Emil has been avoiding revealing his role and is repeatedly pressing Larisa for details. His behavior is highly suspicious and suggests he might be a Werewolf trying to deflect suspicion. Voting for Emil seems the most logical choice to help the village team win.
> **Vladimir [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa has been very vague about the exact positions of the Minion and Villager cards she claims to have seen in the center. This lack of specificity suggests she might be trying to deceive us. Since I am a Mason and can confirm Vladimir is also a Mason, I trust his account. Emil has been persistent in questioning Larisa and hasn't shown any signs of deceit, so I don't find him suspicious. Therefore, I believe Larisa is the most likely Werewolf.
> **Dragos [Mason]:** I am voting for Larisa.


The votes were:
* Larisa : Seer : 2
* Emil : Villager : 3



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The werewolves win.
