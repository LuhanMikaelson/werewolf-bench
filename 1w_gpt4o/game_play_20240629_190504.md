## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Cristina. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Stefan is a minion and is aware that Cristina is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Andrei. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Lucian. They are thinking about their action.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at the center cards gives a broader understanding of the possible roles not in play, which can help deduce the identities of others. This information can be crucial for guiding the discussion during the Day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to prompt the Seer to reveal themselves so I can gauge their information and potentially discredit them or use their knowledge to my advantage.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, let's get to the bottom of this. I noticed that nobody has claimed to be a Seer yet. If there is a Seer among us, they should definitely speak up and tell us what they saw in the center or from another player. This could really help us identify who the Werewolf might be.


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By asking generally about suspicious behavior, I can gather information from the other players and see if anyone slips up or makes an unconvincing claim. This helps me identify potential Villagers, Masons, or the Seer so that I can protect Cristina and direct suspicion away from her.
> **Stefan:** Alright, everyone. Let's get to the bottom of this. I think it's important to point out that we have quite a few Villager roles in play. With that in mind, I want to ask: has anyone seen any suspicious behavior or cards that might indicate someone is a Werewolf?


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the information that I saw two Villagers in the center, I can help narrow down the roles in play and guide the discussion toward finding the Werewolf or Minion. This adds value to the conversation and moves us closer to identifying the threats.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, here's something important to consider. I am confident that there are at least two Villagers in the center. This means that we have fewer Villagers among us than we might think. Now, let's focus on identifying the Werewolf or Minion among us. Someone might be pretending to be a Villager to blend in.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's confident statement about the center cards could be a crucial piece of information. We need to understand his reasoning to either validate or invalidate his claim, which might help us narrow down the roles among us and identify the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Larisa:** Alright, we need to get to the bottom of this quickly. Lucian, you mentioned that there are at least two Villagers in the center. How can you be so sure about this? Did you see something specific?


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing that I saw the two Villagers in the center and pressing for role claims, we can start to narrow down who might be lying. This will help us identify the Werewolf or Minion among us.
> **Lucian:** Larisa, I can be sure about the two Villagers in the center because I saw them there myself during the night phase. This means that anyone claiming to be a Villager among us needs to be questioned closely, as they might be lying to blend in. So, I would like to ask everyone now: What roles are you claiming?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to clarify who might be the Seer to make an informed judgment. Cristina's inquiry about the Seer without stating her role is suspicious and might help us gather more information about the roles in play.
> **Larisa:** Cristina, you brought up the Seer earlier but haven't mentioned anything about your own role. Are you the Seer?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By deflecting the question about my role and subtly supporting Lucian's claim, I aim to build credibility. By putting the spotlight on Stefan, I can gauge his response and gather more information to deduce who might be the Seer or other roles.
> **Cristina:** Larisa, that's a fair question. I am not the Seer, but I am definitely not a Werewolf either. If Lucian really saw two Villagers in the center, that means we only have one Villager role among us. Since I am one of the remaining Villagers, I think it's important to hear from everyone else about their roles. Stefan, what role are you claiming?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Cristina's claim of being a Villager, I can direct suspicion away from her actual role as a Werewolf and focus attention elsewhere. This can help protect Cristina and ensure that she remains undetected.
> **Stefan:** Cristina, you say you’re definitely not a Werewolf, but I’m not entirely convinced. Lucian claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, which means we have fewer Villagers among us. If you’re claiming to be a Villager, that sounds very convenient given the situation. I think you might be trying to blend in and hide your true role. Can you give us a bit more reasoning behind your claim?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Stefan's skepticism head-on and asking for his role, I can deflect suspicion away from myself and gather more information about his potential role. This will help in determining if he might be the Seer or another special role.
> **Cristina:** Stefan, I understand your skepticism, but we need to be careful not to jump to conclusions too quickly. From what we have gathered so far, Lucian claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which means we have fewer Villagers among us than we originally thought. Since I am claiming to be a Villager, and we know that there are two Villager cards in the center, it could mean that someone else is lying. Stefan, you're questioning my claim, but you haven't mentioned what your role is. What role are you claiming?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Cristina's claim, I can direct suspicion away from her actual role as a Werewolf and focus attention elsewhere. This helps protect Cristina and ensure that she remains undetected.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, I've been thinking this through carefully. Since Lucian claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, and Cristina is claiming to be a Villager, we need to question this further. If we assume Lucian is telling the truth, then Cristina might be trying to blend in by claiming the now limited Villager role. Cristina, I'm not convinced by your claim.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Stefan's skepticism directly and urging the Seer to reveal themselves, I aim to deflect suspicion away from myself. If Stefan reveals more about his role, it could help identify if he is a Seer, Mason, or Villager, and consequently guide my strategy to avoid being caught as the Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Stefan, you seem to be focusing a lot on me and my claim of being a Villager. This makes me wonder, why are you so eager to cast doubt on my role? If we are to believe Lucian's claim that he saw two Villagers in the center, then we need to be more strategic and cautious about our suspicions. I'm not the Seer, but I also don't think the real Seer should stay silent. If the Seer is among us, now would be a good time to reveal what they saw. Stefan, can you tell us more about your role and why you're so insistent on questioning my claim?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By focusing on Larisa and her role claim, I can gather more information about the other players and potentially identify the Seer or Masons. This helps me protect Cristina and direct suspicion away from her, as well as find targets to vote for during the VOTE phase.
> **Stefan:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Lucian claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, which reduces the number of Villagers among us. Cristina is claiming to be a Villager, but I think we need to question this further. Given that Cristina brought up the Seer and seems very interested in shifting attention away from herself, I suspect she might be trying to blend in. Larisa, you haven't mentioned your role yet. Can you tell us what role you're claiming?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's focus on the Seer and her claim to be a Villager seems suspicious, especially with Lucian's information about the center cards. We need to press her for more details to see if her story holds up or if she's trying to blend in.
> **Larisa:** Alright, everyone, this is getting intense. Cristina, you have been very vocal about wanting to know the Seer's identity, but you haven't given us much information about yourself. Given that Lucian claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, I find it a bit suspicious that you're so insistent on being a Villager. Why don't you tell us more about your reasoning and why we should trust you?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Lucian, I can deflect attention away from myself and create doubt about his claim. This will make it harder for others to pinpoint me as the Werewolf, and it gives me a chance to see how Lucian defends himself, which might reveal more about his role and intentions.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, I think we need to take a closer look at Lucian. He was quick to claim that he saw two Villagers in the center, but we haven't heard much about what else he might have seen or why he chose to reveal this specific information. This could be a tactic to throw us off.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan has been actively questioning Cristina without revealing his own role. Since I know two Villagers are in the center, it's important to find out what role Stefan is claiming to see if it aligns with the information we have.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, I think it's time to get more specific. Since we know there are fewer Villagers among us, we need to look at other possible roles. Stefan, you have been very vocal and questioning Cristina a lot, but you haven't claimed any role yet. What role are you claiming, and why?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing attention towards Larisa, I can gather more information about her role and potentially identify her as a Villager, Mason, or Seer. This helps me protect Cristina, the Werewolf, by shifting suspicion towards another player, and also helps me identify targets to vote for during the VOTE phase.
> **Stefan:** Larisa, you have been relatively quiet and haven't given us much information about your role. Given that Lucian claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, it means we have fewer Villagers among us. Cristina has been vocal but I still have my doubts about her claim. Larisa, could you please tell us what role you are claiming and why you haven't spoken up much so far?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's behavior is raising red flags. She's very focused on knowing the Seer's identity and hasn't provided much about her own role. If Lucian's claim about the center cards is true, Cristina's Villager claim doesn't add up, making her a prime suspect.
> **Larisa:** Everyone, I think we need to focus on Lucian's claim again. If Lucian really saw two Villagers in the center, that means Cristina's claim to be a Villager is highly suspicious. Given that she's been very vocal and insistent about her role, I'm starting to believe she might be trying to blend in as a Werewolf or Minion.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian's claim about the center cards effectively reduces the number of Villager claims that can be made. Given this, Cristina's vocal stance on being a Villager seems suspicious and could indicate she's trying to blend in as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's focus on the inconsistencies here. Lucian claimed to see two Villagers in the center, which limits the number of Villagers among us. Cristina has been very vocal about being a Villager, but this doesn't add up. Cristina, why are you so insistent on your claim?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Lucian's claim and making him the focal point, I can deflect suspicion away from myself. This will also force him to defend his position, potentially revealing more about his role or tripping up, which could benefit my chances of staying hidden as the Werewolf. Additionally, if Lucian is pressured, it might shift attention away from anyone else who might be a threat to me, such as the Seer or another Villager.
> **Cristina:** Lucian, you've been very specific and confident about seeing two Villagers in the center. But the thing is, if you're the Seer, wouldn't you have shared more about what else you might have seen, or if you're another role, why not clarify that? I'm beginning to think that you're trying to manipulate the information to your advantage. Can you explain why we should trust your claim?


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I've already provided crucial information about the center cards being Villagers, it's important to get others to reveal their roles to identify inconsistencies. Stefan's reluctance to claim a role while actively questioning others makes him a prime suspect for being a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Lucian:** Stefan, you've been very vocal and questioning Cristina a lot, but you still haven't claimed any role yet. I find this highly suspicious. What role are you claiming, and why?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian's claim to have seen two Villagers in the center has been questioned by multiple players, including myself. His refusal to provide more details about his role or additional information makes his claim suspicious. By voting for Lucian, I aim to eliminate a potential threat who might be misleading the group.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to direct suspicion away from Cristina, the Werewolf, and towards another player. Larisa has been quiet and hasn't given a clear role, making her an easy target.
> **Stefan [Minion]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** I am the Seer and I saw two Villagers in the center, which means there is only one Villager among the four of us. Cristina has been consistent with her claim of being a Villager despite the misgivings, and Larisa hasn't said much to arouse suspicion. Meanwhile, Stefan has been actively deflecting and questioning Cristina without revealing his own role, making him the most suspicious. I believe Stefan might be the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian [Seer]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Based on Lucian's claim that he saw two Villagers in the center, Cristina's insistence on being a Villager doesn't add up. Her focus on the Seer and reluctance to provide more information about her own role raises suspicion that she might be trying to blend in as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Larisa [Villager]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian's consistent claim about seeing two Villagers in the center reduces the number of Villagers among us. Cristina's vocal insistence on being a Villager despite this information seems suspicious. She might be trying to blend in as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Cristina.


The votes were:
* Cristina : Werewolf : 2
* Stefan : Minion : 1
* Lucian : Seer : 1
* Larisa : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Cristina was killed. The villagers win.
