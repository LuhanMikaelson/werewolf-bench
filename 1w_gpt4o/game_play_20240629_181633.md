## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Marius. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Stefan is a minion and is aware that Marius is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Cristina. They are thinking about their action.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards gives me a broader sense of which roles are in play and which roles are not. This information can be crucial in deducing the identities of the other players and forming a strategy for the village team.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather information from the players with night actions to identify who might be lying and figure out who the Werewolves are. This should help us form an initial idea about who could be a Werewolf.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's start by hearing if anyone has seen anything suspicious during the night. Any Seers or Masons who saw something should probably speak up.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** The Seer’s information can be extremely valuable in either confirming the innocence of some players or pointing us towards potential Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** I think we need to hear from the Seer if they're willing to share what they saw during the night. It could be crucial in narrowing down our suspects.


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming to be a Villager and asking for information, I aim to blend in and gather as much information as possible while not drawing suspicion towards myself or Marius.
> **Stefan:** I think it's important to start by clearing up some roles. As for myself, I'm just a Villager. But I'm curious, did anyone see anything unusual during the night? Especially the Seer or the Masons, who might have crucial information.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Since I need to cast suspicion away from myself and onto others, I'm focusing on Stefan's immediate claim of being a Villager. This could make others doubt his honesty and shift the focus away from me. Additionally, by emphasizing that I'm just a Villager, it supports my cover story.
> **Marius:** Well, I didn't see anything unusual during the night because I'm just a Villager. But I think it's interesting to note that Stefan immediately claimed to be a Villager without any hesitation. Isn't that a bit too convenient? Maybe he's trying to hide something. What do you all think?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** By sharing the information I obtained as the Seer, I aim to narrow down the potential roles in play and provide a solid foundation for our deductions.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, I have seen the Mason and a Villager card in the center. This means that there is only one Mason among us, and we can rule out one Villager role being here. Given that, I think we should focus on identifying the Werewolf team from the remaining players.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's claim that she saw a Mason and a Villager in the center needs to be scrutinized. If she really is the Seer, she'll have a solid reason for her choice, and her information can help narrow down our suspects. If she's lying, it would be beneficial for the Werewolves to cast doubt on the valid roles.
> **Larisa:** Cristina, can you elaborate on why you decided to check the center cards and what made you choose those specific cards?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** By providing a clear explanation and asking for others to come forward, I can help guide the discussion towards revealing more information about the roles in play. This will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Larisa, I chose to look at the center cards because it gives us more information about which roles are not in play and helps us narrow down our suspects. Knowing that the Mason and a Villager card are in the center means we can discount those roles being held by players. I'm still curious about everyone's roles, especially anyone claiming to be a Mason.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center aligns with her being the Seer, but I want to ensure her reasoning is consistent and logical. This could help validate her claim or expose inconsistencies if she's lying.
> **Larisa:** Cristina, while your explanation makes sense, I want to understand a bit more about why you specifically chose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card. Was there any particular reason for that choice?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea was quick to ask for the Seer to speak up but hasn't mentioned his own role, which seems suspicious. If he provides a role, it could help us narrow down our suspects.
> **Cristina:** Mircea, you've been pretty quiet about your role. Can you tell us what role you had during the night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's avoidance of player cards could be a tactic to prevent identifying a Werewolf. Her decision seems logical but warrants further investigation to ensure she's not hiding something.
> **Mircea:** Cristina, your explanation about the center cards makes sense, but I'm curious why you didn't check any player cards directly. Could it be that you were trying to avoid exposing a Werewolf?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's reluctance to reveal his role and his questioning of my decision as the Seer make him seem suspicious. We need to get more information from him to either clear or confirm our doubts.
> **Cristina:** Mircea, I'm not trying to avoid exposing a Werewolf. Remember, looking at the center cards gave us critical information that there's only one Mason and one less Villager. So let's focus on figuring out who might be lying. Mircea, what role did you have during the night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Stefan was quick to claim being a Villager, it raises some suspicion. It is better to question him and get more details to see if he might be lying or trying to hide something.
> **Mircea:** Stefan, I'm curious why you were so quick to claim that you're a Villager right off the bat. It seems like you might be trying to deflect suspicion away from yourself. Can you give us more details about why you made that claim so early?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** Mircea has been deflecting questions and hasn't given any information about his role. By directing the question at him, I can put him on the spot and potentially uncover inconsistencies in his story. This could help shift suspicion away from Marius and myself.
> **Stefan:** Mircea, I'm curious about your role and why you've been so quiet. You've asked questions but haven't provided any information about your role. Could you tell us what you were during the night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's choice to look at the center cards instead of another player's card could indicate that she wanted to avoid revealing crucial information about a teammate. Clarifying her reasoning is essential to determine her true role.
> **Mircea:** Cristina, your explanation about the center cards is clear, but I'm not completely convinced. Why did you choose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card? Was it because you already knew what might be there?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan's immediate claim to be a Villager could be an attempt to blend in and deflect suspicion. We need more information from him to determine if he's being truthful.
> **Cristina:** Stefan, you've been quick to claim Villager, and Marius found that suspicious. Can you tell us more about why you were so eager to share your role?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Cristina's choice, I can cast doubt on her intentions and potentially shift focus away from Marius and myself. If I can make her seem suspicious, it will divert attention and votes towards her.
> **Stefan:** Cristina, while your move to look at the center cards was useful, it seems odd that you chose not to look at any player's card directly. To me, it feels like you might be trying to steer us away from finding a Werewolf among the players. Could you explain why you didn't check any other player's card during the night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's reluctance to reveal his role and constant questioning of my actions as the Seer are very suspicious. It's time to put some pressure on him and see how he responds.
> **Cristina:** Mircea, you've been deflecting questions and avoiding revealing your role. This makes me highly suspicious of you. Are you hiding something? Could it be that you're the Werewolf?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's choice to check the center cards rather than a player's card might suggest she's trying to avoid revealing a teammate. Stefan's quick claim of being a Villager could be a deflection. We need to scrutinize their actions more closely.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, I think it's time we start piecing this together. Cristina, you've given us information about the center cards, but your reluctance to look at a player's card directly is still bothering me. Stefan, on the other hand, immediately claimed to be a Villager, which could be an attempt to hide something. We need to figure this out, and quickly.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's immediate claim of being a Villager and his lack of detailed reasoning raises suspicion. By questioning him directly, we can test his responses and see if they hold up or if he starts to falter, potentially revealing his true role.
> **Mircea:** Stefan, you're quick to claim being a Villager, but something doesn't sit right with me. You've been pushing for information but haven't given us any solid reasoning. Why should we believe you're not hiding something?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Marius directly, I can create the illusion of doubt between players and potentially divert attention away from myself. This also forces Marius to provide a cover story, which could help us identify inconsistencies later on.
> **Stefan:** Marius, you've been accusing me of being too quick to claim Villager, but you haven't given us any information about your own role. Why don't you tell us what you were during the night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center adds up, and no one else has counterclaimed the Seer role, making her information likely credible. Mircea has been deflecting questions and avoiding revealing his role, which makes him highly suspicious to me. Additionally, Stefan and Marius both claimed to be Villagers, which aligns with the roles remaining if Cristina's information is accurate. Therefore, I believe Mircea is the most likely to be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Larisa [Villager]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan was very quick to claim being a Villager without providing solid reasoning. This raises suspicion that he might be trying to deflect attention away from himself. Additionally, Marius also pointed out that Stefan's quick claim seemed convenient. Given the information we have, Stefan's actions seem the most suspicious.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** Cristina's reluctance to look at another player's card directly, and her continued deflection of questions towards other players, raises significant suspicion. By voting for Cristina, I aim to draw attention away from Marius and myself, and create doubt among the players about her intentions.
> **Stefan [Minion]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea has been deflecting questions and avoiding revealing his role, which makes him highly suspicious. Also, his reluctance to give any solid reasoning or information points towards him potentially hiding something. This aligns with building suspicion away from myself as the Werewolf.
> **Marius [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea was consistently deflecting questions and avoiding revealing his role, which makes him highly suspicious. His constant questioning of my actions as the Seer without providing any useful information about his own role further increases the suspicion. Therefore, I believe he is most likely a Werewolf or Minion trying to deflect attention.
> **Cristina [Seer]:** I am voting for Mircea.


The votes were:
* Mircea : Villager : 3
* Stefan : Minion : 1
* Cristina : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Mircea was killed. The werewolves win.
