## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Dragos. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Stefan is a minion and is aware that Dragos is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Radu. They are thinking about their action.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather information about which roles are not in play. This will help narrow down the possibilities and guide our discussions during the Day phase. It also prevents me from accidentally revealing useful information to the Werewolves if I were to check a player's card and that player turns out to be a Werewolf.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the only Werewolf, my goal is to blend in and appear as a Villager. By encouraging the Seer to speak up, I can try to identify who they are and potentially cast doubt on their claims later, or even accuse them of being a Werewolf to divert attention.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's get things going. I believe it's important to establish some initial claims. I'll start by saying I'm a Villager. We should also hear from the Seer as soon as possible, so they can help us identify any potential threats. Has anyone seen something suspicious last night?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing my role and the information I gained, I can help narrow down the possible roles everyone else might have. This information is crucial for identifying the Werewolves and reducing the chances of false claims.
> **Radu:** Alright, let's get some clarity here. I am the Seer, and last night I checked the center cards. I saw a Villager and a Mason. This means those roles are not in play among us.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** This will help us verify Radu's claim as the Seer and also identify if other roles might be in play based on the unselected center cards.
> **Emil:** Radu, I have a question for you. Since you claim to be the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, can you tell us which center cards you specifically checked so we can narrow down our suspicions?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** By specifying which center cards I checked, we can ensure that the information I provided about the Villager and Mason not being in play is accurate and helps narrow down the roles that everyone else might have. This will assist in identifying any false claims or suspicious behavior.
> **Radu:** Emil, I checked the two center cards on the left side.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to question Dragos's immediate claim to be a Villager, as it could be a tactic to deflect suspicion early on. If he's a Werewolf or Minion, his early move might be a strategy to blend in.
> **Emil:** Alright, Dragos, you claimed to be a Villager earlier, but I find it a bit too convenient that you made the first move to establish yourself as innocent. What makes you so sure about your role?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question to Alexandra, I can gauge her reaction and potentially catch her off guard if she's hiding something. This also helps to gather more information and keeps the focus away from me. If she claims to be a Mason and there's no contradiction, we can start verifying other roles.
> **Dragos:** Alexandra, given that you haven't spoken much yet, can you tell us what your role is? If you're a Mason, it would be useful to know if there's another Mason among us.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** By directly questioning Dragos, I can gauge his reaction and possibly catch him off guard if he is lying. His quick declaration to be a Villager seems suspicious and could be a cover for a more deceitful role.
> **Alexandra:** Dragos, I find it interesting that you were so quick to claim Villager. It seems like you were trying to establish yourself as trustworthy right away. Can you explain why you didn't wait for more information before making your claim?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Asking Stefan about his role allows us to gather more information and possibly find inconsistencies in the claims. It also helps me avoid direct confrontation with Alexandra and redirect suspicion away from myself.
> **Dragos:** Alexandra, I understand why you might find my early claim suspicious, but I believe it was important to get everyone talking and establishing their roles early on. Now, given what Radu said about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center, it leaves us in a position where we need to verify the rest of the roles among us. Since we haven't heard from Stefan yet, Stefan, what role did you wake up with?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** Radu's claim seems too convenient and might be a way to mislead us. By questioning him further, we can see if his story holds up under scrutiny. This also helps me subtly protect Dragos by casting doubt on someone else.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, given the information we have so far, I'm finding it a bit suspicious that Radu claimed to be the Seer and conveniently saw a Villager and a Mason in the center cards. This could be an attempt to divert us from finding the real Werewolf among us. Radu, can you give us a bit more detail about why you chose those specific center cards to check? What made you think those were the ones worth looking at?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** By challenging Stefan, I am putting him on the defensive and forcing him to provide more information. This could reveal inconsistencies if he's a Werewolf or Minion trying to deflect suspicion.
> **Radu:** Stefan, you seem a bit too eager to cast doubt on my claim as the Seer. Why are you so quick to question my actions without providing any information about your own role?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Dragos, I can deflect suspicion away from him while appearing to be a concerned Villager. This also helps in stirring doubt among the others, allowing me to subtly protect him as a Werewolf.
> **Stefan:** Dragos, you seem very eager to drive this conversation and put the spotlight on others. Why did you not share any detailed reasoning behind your claim of being a Villager? If you have nothing to hide, you should be willing to give us more information.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Radu's claim as the Seer, I aim to divert attention away from myself and onto someone else. If Radu is indeed the Seer, creating suspicion around his role can help disrupt the Villager's strategy and protect my identity as the Werewolf.
> **Dragos:** Radu, you claim to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, but it's possible you're trying to divert our attention from yourself. Considering we need to verify everyone's roles, I find it highly suspicious that you made such a convenient claim. I think we need to keep a close eye on you as a potential Werewolf.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to see if Alexandra is withholding information or if she can confirm her role, which will help us narrow down the possible Werewolves and identify any false claims. Since Dragos and Stefan both seem eager to cast suspicion, we need to hear from other players too.
> **Radu:** Alexandra, you haven't given us your role yet, which is making me suspicious. Are you trying to hide something? If you're a Mason, as Dragos asked earlier, it would be good to know if the other Mason card is in play.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been quick to establish himself as a Villager and has continuously directed attention to others without providing much reasoning behind his own actions. This behavior is consistent with someone trying to deflect suspicion and hide their true identity.
> **Alexandra:** Based on the information we have so far, it seems like Dragos and Radu are trying to drive the conversation and direct suspicion elsewhere. Since no one else has directly mentioned another player in a while, I'm going to make an accusation. I think Dragos is acting suspiciously with his quick claim to be a Villager and his eagerness to question others. I'm accusing Dragos of being a Werewolf.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan seems to be diverting attention without providing much information about his own role, which could be suspicious and indicative of a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Alexandra:** Stefan, you've been questioning others a lot without sharing your own role. Why haven't you told us what your role is yet?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Dragos, I can protect him from suspicion by making it seem like others are falsely accusing him. This also helps to mislead the other players and keep them focused on the wrong targets. It's important to keep the heat off Dragos while identifying other Villagers or Seers to target.
> **Stefan:** Alright, I think it's time to clear some things up. Dragos, you came out strong with your claim of being a Villager, and then you quickly shifted the attention to Alexandra when she accused you. You're acting a bit defensive. I think you're trying to deflect suspicion away from yourself. Everyone, I believe Dragos is the Werewolf trying to mislead us.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting the spotlight on Stefan and his lack of transparency, I can divert attention away from myself and potentially cast doubt on his intentions. This helps me blend in and appear as a concerned Villager.
> **Dragos:** Stefan, you seem to be very eager to cast doubt on both Radu and me without giving us any information about your role. This defensive behavior is making me suspicious of you. Why haven't you shared your role yet? If you're trying to help the village, you should come clean.


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Radu's claim, I aim to cast doubt on his credibility and subtly protect Dragos. If Radu can't provide a solid explanation, it might make others suspicious of him, diverting attention away from Dragos.
> **Stefan:** Radu, you've been very vocal about being the Seer and checking the center cards. However, your story seems too convenient. Why did you choose to check those specific cards? Are you trying to divert our attention away from yourself?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan has been very eager to cast doubt on both Dragos and me without revealing anything about his own role. This defensive behavior is making him suspicious. It's time to put him on the spot and see if he can provide a credible explanation for his actions. If he's not forthcoming, it might indicate he's hiding a Werewolf or Minion role.
> **Radu:** Stefan, you've been deflecting and questioning a lot without offering any concrete information about yourself. Why haven't you shared your role yet? If you're truly helping the village, you should come clean. Right now, it feels like you're hiding something.


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By redirecting suspicion to Emil, I can take some heat off Dragos and shift the focus away from the Werewolf. Emil's silence can be interpreted as suspicious behavior, and questioning him might make others doubt his intentions. This also helps me to identify his role, which can be useful for the Werewolf team.
> **Stefan:** Everyone, I think we need to take a closer look at Emil. While Radu has been very vocal about being the Seer and providing specific details about the center cards, Emil has been relatively quiet and only asked a few questions without sharing much about his own role. This could be a tactic to avoid drawing attention to himself. Emil, can you please explain your role and why you've been so reserved?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Radu's claim of being the Seer and seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center seems convenient and unverified. This could be an attempt to mislead us. Additionally, others have expressed doubt about his claim, making him a likely target for suspicion.
> **Dragos [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan has been deflecting and questioning others without providing any concrete information about his own role. This defensive behavior is making him highly suspicious, and it seems like he might be trying to hide a Werewolf or Minion role. Voting for Stefan seems like the best choice to help the village win.
> **Radu [Seer]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos was the first to claim Villager without waiting for more information, which could be an attempt to assert trustworthiness early on. His defense and quick accusations against others when questioned also seemed too defensive, making him a likely Werewolf.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos was quick to claim Villager without waiting for more information and has been deflecting attention to others throughout the discussion. This behavior is suspicious and indicative of someone trying to hide their true identity. Given the information and interactions we've had, Dragos seems most likely to be a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** Radu's claim of being the Seer and seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center seems too convenient and could be a way to mislead us. By casting doubt on his credibility, we can protect Dragos and divert suspicion away from the Werewolf team.
> **Stefan [Minion]:** I am voting for Radu.


The votes were:
* Dragos : Werewolf : 2
* Radu : Seer : 2
* Stefan : Minion : 1
