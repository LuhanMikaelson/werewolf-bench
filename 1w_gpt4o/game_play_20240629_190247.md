## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** As Masons, we know each other's identity, and this is crucial information to share early on to build trust and focus our efforts on identifying the Werewolves and the Minion.
> **Ileana:** I can confirm one thing – Larisa is definitely not a Werewolf because we are both Masons. We need to figure out who the Werewolves and Minion are.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I'm a Mason and Ileana confirmed it, we're on the same team. I'm trying to gather more information about the other roles and see if Michael might reveal something useful or suspicious.
> **Larisa:** Michael, do you have any information about the center cards or any other roles?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Since Ileana and Larisa have already confirmed each other as Masons, it would be wise to use that information to build credibility. By confirming that one of the center cards is a Villager, I subtly support the idea that there is only one Werewolf, which aligns with my secret knowledge. This also diverts attention away from me while providing useful but non-damaging information.
> **Michael:** Well, from what I can gather, it seems like the Masons are accounted for. Ileana and Larisa have vouched for each other, which adds some credibility to their claims. Now, I didn't see any Masons myself, but from their conversation, it sounds plausible. As for the center cards, I can confirm that one of them is indeed a Villager card, because I saw it. So, we need to keep that in mind too.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Since Ileana and Larisa are claiming Mason, it's logical to gather more information from the remaining players. This will help me identify potential threats or allies while diverting attention away from myself.
> **Michael:** Ileana and Larisa have both confirmed each other as Masons, which really helps narrow things down. Now, we should hear from everyone. Andrei and Cristina, what roles did you guys see or have? I think this information will help us figure out who the Werewolf could be.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana and Larisa have vouched for each other as Masons, and Michael has claimed to have seen a Villager card in the center. It's crucial to get more information from Cristina to help narrow down the suspects for the Werewolves or Minion.
> **Andrei:** I think it's important for Cristina to share her role or any information she might have seen during the night. It feels like we're missing a key piece of the puzzle here.


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** It's crucial for us to hear from everyone, and Andrei's silence is making me suspicious. If we can get him to talk, we might be able to identify inconsistencies or catch a slip-up that could reveal a Werewolf or Minion. Plus, directing the attention towards Andrei helps keep Michael, the actual Werewolf, out of the spotlight.
> **Cristina:** I think it's a bit suspicious that Andrei hasn't shared any specific details yet. He's been really quiet, which makes me wonder if he's trying to hide something. Andrei, can you tell us exactly what role you had and what you saw during the night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's the only one who hasn't provided any concrete information yet. Her input could be the missing piece we need to identify the Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Andrei:** Alright, Cristina, you're right. I've been a bit quiet, but it's because I wanted to hear from others first. Now, I really think we need to hear from you. What role did you have during the night and did you see anything? This information is crucial for us to make the right decision.


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Andrei for more details, it keeps the focus away from Michael, the actual Werewolf. Additionally, it helps build a narrative that Andrei might be hiding something, which could lead to him being voted out.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, you've been deflecting and not giving concrete information. It's starting to look really suspicious. Can you tell us more about what you did during the night, and if you saw anything?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has been deflecting and accusing me without providing any concrete information about her own role. It's crucial to get her input to figure out who the Werewolves or Minion might be.
> **Andrei:** Cristina, you've been pointing fingers at me, but you still haven't told us what role you had or if you saw anything during the night. We need that information now.


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** It's important to keep the spotlight on Andrei to draw suspicion away from Michael, the actual Werewolf. By pushing Andrei to clarify his role, we might find inconsistencies in his story or at least keep the focus off Michael.
> **Cristina:** Alright, everyone, let's focus. Andrei has been really quiet and deflective. He's not providing any concrete information, which makes me think he's hiding something. Andrei, can you clarify your role once and for all?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's continuous deflection and accusations without giving any solid information make her seem suspicious. If she has a valuable role, like the Seer, she should share what she saw to help us narrow down the suspects. Otherwise, her behavior could indicate she's trying to hide something, possibly being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei:** Cristina, you've been deflecting and accusing me a lot, and still haven't provided any concrete information about your role. Are you the Seer or do you have some other role you're hiding?


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei's deflective behavior and lack of specific information makes him an easy target to divert suspicion away from Michael, who is the actual Werewolf. By pushing Andrei to give more details, it increases the chances of catching inconsistencies in his story or keeping the focus off Michael.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, you've been really vague and deflective throughout this discussion. It feels like you're hiding something. If you don't clarify your role right now and provide specific details about what you saw during the night, I'm going to have to accuse you of being the Werewolf.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's constant deflection and accusations without sharing any concrete information about her role make her seem suspicious. We need to get her to reveal her role or information to narrow down the suspects for the Werewolves or Minion.
> **Andrei:** Cristina, you've been accusing me a lot without providing any details about your role. This is looking increasingly suspicious. What exactly did you see or do during the night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** By keeping the focus on Andrei, it's easier to protect Michael, the actual Werewolf. Andrei's vague responses and reluctance to provide details make it easier to build a narrative that he is hiding something, which can lead to him being voted out instead of Michael.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, you're making me really suspicious with your constant deflections and the fact that you still haven't provided any specific details about your role or what you saw during the night. The village needs clarity, and your behavior is making it really hard to trust you. I'm starting to think you might be the Werewolf trying to avoid detection.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has been constantly accusing me without giving any clear information about her role. Her behavior is highly suspicious, and it's crucial to get her to reveal her role to narrow down the suspects for the Werewolves or Minion. If she's hiding something, it might indicate she's either a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Andrei:** Cristina, you have been very accusatory and deflective towards me without providing any concrete information about your role or what you saw during the night. This makes you look very suspicious. Can you finally tell us what role you had and what you saw during the night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei's lack of information is making him look very suspicious. By pressing him to clarify his role, I can keep the focus off Michael, the actual Werewolf. This way, we can create a narrative that Andrei is hiding something, which might lead to him being voted out instead of Michael.
> **Cristina:** Alright, everyone, I've been thinking about everything that's been said so far. Michael claimed to have seen a Villager card in the center, which is believable since we have multiple Villager cards in the game. But what still bothers me is Andrei's reluctance to share specific details. Andrei, you still haven't clarified your role or what you saw during the night. This is crucial information that could help us figure out who the Werewolves are. Why are you being so vague?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has been very accusatory and deflective without sharing any clear information about her role. It's crucial to get her to reveal her role or any information she has to narrow down the suspects for the Werewolves or Minion.
> **Andrei:** Cristina, you've been pointing fingers at me a lot without providing any concrete information yourself. This looks really suspicious to me. Can you finally tell us what role you had and what you saw during the night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei's silence and deflective responses are raising red flags. By pressing him further and making him the main target, it distracts attention away from Michael, the actual Werewolf. This strategy helps build a narrative that Andrei is hiding something, making it easier to direct suspicion towards him and away from Michael.
> **Cristina:** Everyone, I've been listening carefully to what's been going on, and while it's true we need to hear from everyone, I'm also getting more and more suspicious of Andrei. He's been very evasive and hasn't given us any clear information about his role or what he saw during the night. This kind of behavior is typical of someone who is trying to hide something. Andrei, if you really are a Villager or have any useful information, now is the time to share it. Otherwise, I'm going to have to point the finger at you as a potential Werewolf.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has been very accusatory without sharing any clear information about her role. It's crucial to get her to reveal her role or any information she has to narrow down the suspects for the Werewolves or Minion. Her behavior suggests she might be hiding something, and we need to clarify her actions.
> **Andrei:** Cristina, you've been deflecting and accusing me a lot without providing any concrete information about your own role. This looks really suspicious. Can you finally tell us what role you had and what you saw during the night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** By focusing the suspicion on Andrei, who has been evasive, I can divert attention away from Michael, the actual Werewolf. This strategy helps build a narrative that Andrei is hiding something, making it easier to direct suspicion towards him and away from my Werewolf ally.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, I've been listening to all the discussions, and one thing stands out to me: Andrei's behavior. He's been very evasive and hasn't provided any clear information about his role or what he saw during the night. This kind of behavior is typical of someone who's trying to hide something. I'm starting to think Andrei might be the Werewolf trying to avoid detection. Andrei, if you're a Villager or have any useful information, speak up now. Otherwise, I'm pointing the finger at you as a potential Werewolf.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei has been extremely evasive and hasn't provided any concrete information about his role or what he saw during the night. This kind of behavior is very suspicious and typical of someone trying to hide something. Given the consistent deflections and avoidance of sharing details, I believe Andrei might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf. Voting for him is our best chance to eliminate a threat to the village.
> **Ileana [Mason]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana and I have confirmed each other as Masons, and Michael's claim about seeing a Villager card in the center is believable. Cristina has been consistently asking Andrei for information, but he has been very evasive and hasn't provided any clear details about his role or what he saw. This behavior is highly suspicious and points towards him potentially being a Werewolf.
> **Larisa [Mason]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Cristina's accusations and Andrei's evasive behavior throughout the discussions make him the most suspicious candidate. Voting for Andrei aligns with the ongoing suspicion and diverts attention away from me, helping the werewolf team win.

***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has been highly suspicious throughout the discussion, constantly deflecting and accusing me without providing any concrete information about her own role. This behavior is typical of someone who is trying to hide something, possibly being a Werewolf or Minion. Ileana and Larisa have vouched for each other as Masons, and Michael's claim about seeing a Villager card in the center seems plausible.
