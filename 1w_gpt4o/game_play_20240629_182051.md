## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexia. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Lucian. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Stefan. They are thinking about their action.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles that are not in play. This will help me and the village team narrow down the possibilities and identify the werewolves more effectively.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as we can to identify the Werewolves. Starting with a broad question will help us understand what everyone is claiming and spot any inconsistencies early on.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, let's start by sharing what roles we saw or what we did last night.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By starting with a claim of being a simple Villager, I aim to blend in and not draw too much attention to myself. This role is common and non-threatening, making it a safe claim while I gather information from others.
> **Alexia:** Alright, everyone. I think it's best if we start by sharing what roles we each had. This will help us figure out who might be lying. I'll start: I was a Villager last night, so I didn't have any special actions to perform.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** It's important to scrutinize the first person who speaks, as they might be trying to set the narrative early. Also, as a Mason, I'm looking for inconsistencies in claims to help identify the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** I find it interesting that Alexia jumped in as the first person to claim a role. Why did you feel the need to declare yourself as a Villager right away?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question back to Lucian, I can deflect suspicion away from myself and encourage others to share their roles, which can help me gather more information to cast doubt on the Villagers, Masons, and Seers.
> **Alexia:** Lucian, I'm just trying to get the conversation started and help us figure out who might be lying. We need to work together to identify the Werewolves. What role did you have last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** It's essential to get input from everyone. Kraven's silence is suspicious, and we need to know his role to piece together the night events.
> **Lucian:** Kraven, you've been pretty quiet. What role did you have last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to see if Lucian's behavior aligns with that of a Villager or if he might be trying to deflect suspicion away from himself. If he's a Werewolf, his response might give us clues.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, you seem pretty eager to put Alexia on the spot. Why is that?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's deflection and avoidance of sharing his role makes him suspicious. Pressuring him for an answer might reveal more about his intentions or role.
> **Lucian:** Kraven, you're deflecting my question and avoiding sharing your own role. That seems pretty suspicious to me. What role did you have last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's behavior is suspicious because he's aggressively questioning others without revealing his own role. This could be an attempt to deflect attention and protect his identity if he's a Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, why are you pressing so hard for people to reveal their roles? It seems like you're trying to control the conversation and direct suspicion away from yourself. What role did you have last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's deflection and avoidance make him a prime suspect. We need to press him for information to understand his intentions and potentially uncover any deceit.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's stay focused. It's clear that Kraven is avoiding sharing his role, which is highly suspicious. We need to work together to figure out who's lying. Kraven, I'm asking you once more: What role did you have last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's aggressive behavior and constant questioning without revealing his own role is highly suspicious. It's important to put the spotlight on him to see if he slips up or deflects further, which might indicate he's trying to hide something, potentially being a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, you're being very aggressive in pushing everyone to reveal their roles, but you haven't shared yours yet. What role did you have last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's deflection and avoidance of sharing his role are highly suspicious. By pressing him directly, we can either get him to slip up or reveal more information that might help us piece together the night's events.
> **Lucian:** Alright, Kraven, enough deflecting. You're being incredibly evasive, which makes me think you're hiding something. Are you a Werewolf?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information from everyone, and Cristina hasn't said much. It's important to get her involved and see if her response aligns with others or if it raises any red flags.
> **Kraven:** Cristina, you've been kind of quiet. Do you want to share what role you had last night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been dodging questions which is suspicious behavior. If he were a Villager or a helpful role like Mason or Seer, he would likely want to share that information to help the group. His evasiveness suggests he might be hiding something, like being a Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Kraven, you've been asked multiple times about your role and you've avoided giving an answer. That's looking really suspicious. Are you a Werewolf?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's alignment with Lucian's aggressive questioning without providing any substantial information makes me suspicious of her. If she continues to deflect, it could indicate she is hiding something, possibly being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Kraven:** Cristina, you're avoiding answering my question and just piling on with Lucian. What role did you have last night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been pushing others to reveal their roles without revealing his own, which could be a tactic to deflect attention from himself. It's important to get a clear picture of everyone's claims to spot inconsistencies.
> **Cristina:** Alright, let's calm down a bit and get some clarity. Lucian, you've been quite aggressive, but haven't shared your role either. What role did you have last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing my role as a Mason and stating that the other Mason card is in the center, I provide clarity and make it easier for the village team to piece together the night's events. Kraven's evasiveness needs to be addressed, as it is highly suspicious and could indicate that he's hiding something important.
> **Lucian:** Alright, Cristina, you're right that I haven't shared my role yet. I was a Mason last night. Since I didn't see another Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. This means there's one less potential Werewolf. Kraven, your constant deflection and refusal to share your role are still very suspicious to me.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's aggressive behavior and delayed claim of being a Mason are raising red flags. If he were truly a Mason, he should have revealed this information sooner to help the village team. His actions suggest he might be trying to deceive us.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, your claim of being a Mason seems suspicious to me. If you were really a Mason, why didn't you say so earlier?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's consistent deflection and avoidance of sharing his role make him the prime suspect. By pointing this out, we can put pressure on him and potentially get him to slip up or reveal more information. It's crucial for the village team to identify and eliminate the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's focus. Kraven has been avoiding sharing his role and deflecting questions left and right. This behavior is extremely suspicious and points towards him hiding something. I wouldn't be surprised if he's trying to cover up being a Werewolf. We need to closely scrutinize his actions.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** By making a general statement about Lucian's behavior, I'm trying to shift the focus onto him without making a direct accusation. This will encourage others to scrutinize his actions and possibly reveal more information.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think logically. Based on the behavior we've seen so far, it seems like Lucian is being overly aggressive in pushing others to reveal their roles. This is typically a strategy werewolves use to divert attention. So let's consider this: if Lucian is a werewolf, we'd expect him to be trying to create chaos and confusion.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven's evasiveness and deflection when asked about his role are highly suspicious. We need to hear from him to determine if he's hiding something, possibly being a Werewolf.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, let's focus for a moment. Based on my observation during the night, I can confirm that the Minion and one Villager card are in the center. This means there is no Minion in play, so we only need to find the Werewolves. Now, Lucian, you claimed to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which could be true since the other Mason might be in the center. But Kraven, you've been really evasive, and that doesn't sit well with me. What do you have to say about your role?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been extremely evasive and dodging questions about his role repeatedly. This behavior is highly suspicious and suggests he might be hiding something, possibly being a Werewolf. Lucian's claim of being a Mason adds some credibility, as he provided a specific detail about not seeing another Mason. Given the information we have, Kraven seems the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven has been consistently evasive and deflecting questions throughout the discussion, which is highly suspicious behavior. Lucian's claim as a Mason and Stefan's confirmation that the Minion is in the center make Kraven the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf trying to avoid detection. By voting for Kraven, I aim to align with the majority suspicion and deflect attention away from myself.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven has been consistently evasive and deflecting questions about his role, which is highly suspicious behavior. Given that I am a Mason and know the other Mason card is in the center, and Stefan confirmed the Minion is also in the center, Kraven's actions strongly suggest he might be a Werewolf trying to hide his identity. Voting for Kraven increases the chances of eliminating a Werewolf, which is crucial for the village team to win.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been very aggressive in questioning others without revealing his role until much later. When he did reveal his role as a Mason, it seemed like an attempt to deflect suspicion. Given the information from Stefan that the Minion and one Villager card are in the center, there is a high chance that Lucian is trying to mislead us as a Werewolf.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven has been evasive and deflecting questions about his role throughout the discussion, which is highly suspicious behavior. Given that I know the Minion and one Villager card are in the center, there is no Minion in play, so we only need to identify the Werewolves. Lucian's claim to be a Mason and not seeing another Mason aligns with my knowledge of the center cards. Therefore, Kraven's suspicious behavior points towards him likely being a Werewolf.
> **Stefan [Seer]:** I am voting for Kraven.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Mason : 1
* Kraven : Villager : 4



>***GAME:*** Kraven was killed. The werewolves win.
