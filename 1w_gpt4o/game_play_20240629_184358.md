## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As the only Werewolf, I need to establish myself as a Villager early on. Asking for information from others might help me gather useful clues without revealing my true identity.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, let's get this started. I'll go first. I'm a Villager and I think it's important that we find out who the Werewolves are. Has anyone seen anything suspicious or have any information they want to share?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more information from everyone before we can start piecing things together. Emil's claim doesn't prove anything yet, and we need to see if there's any conflicting information or claims.
> **Lucian:** Alright, Emil, claiming Villager right off the bat. Interesting. But let's not take it at face value just yet. Viktor, what's your role?


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** Emil claiming Villager right off the bat is a good move, but I need to back up his claim by diverting attention away from him. By claiming Mason, I'm trying to establish trust and draw out anyone else who might claim Mason, which would help me identify who the real villagers are and who is lying. This will also help Emil by creating confusion and suspicion among the others.
> **Viktor:** Alright, Lucian, settle down. I'm actually one of the Masons. I checked during the night and saw the other Mason. If anyone else is claiming Mason, they're lying.


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By asking Semira directly, I'm hoping to gather more information while simultaneously diverting attention away from Emil. If she hesitates or stumbles, it could create suspicion around her, which is beneficial for protecting Emil and keeping the focus off him.
> **Viktor:** Alright, it seems we're getting into the thick of it. Semira, what do you have to say about your role? We need everyone to put their cards on the table, metaphorically speaking.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** If Viktor can confidently identify the other Mason, it will help us verify his claim. If not, it might cast doubt on his role.
> **Semira:** Viktor, I'm intrigued by your claim of being a Mason. Since you said you saw the other Mason, can you tell us who that is?


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By identifying Lucian as the other Mason, I'm trying to create a layer of trust between us and draw out anyone who might counter this claim. This will help me to either solidify my false Mason claim or expose potential threats to Emil. It also puts pressure on Lucian to either confirm my story or reveal inconsistencies, which could then be used to shift suspicion away from Emil.
> **Viktor:** Semira, you're right. I should clarify who the other Mason is. During the night, I saw Lucian as the other Mason. So, if anyone else is claiming Mason, they're definitely lying. Lucian, can you confirm this?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim is suspicious because I know I'm not the Mason. This could potentially expose him as a Werewolf or Minion trying to sow confusion. We need to hear from Semira to gather more information.
> **Lucian:** Wait a minute, Viktor. You claim to have seen me as the other Mason? That's interesting because I'm not the Mason. So, either you're mistaken, or you're lying. I'm a Villager, and I suspect you might be trying to mislead us. Semira, you've been quiet. What role do you claim to have?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Given the conflicting claims between Viktor and Lucian, it's crucial to get more information from the other players. Dragos has been quiet so far, and knowing his claim might help us piece together the truth. Additionally, Viktor's specific callout of Lucian makes me curious about the dynamics between them, but Dragos's input could provide another perspective.
> **Semira:** Alright, folks, let's take a step back and think this through. Lucian is claiming to be a Villager, but Viktor is adamant that Lucian is the other Mason. This contradiction needs to be resolved. Viktor, why would you point out Lucian specifically if you were lying? It seems like a bold move. Dragos, what role do you claim to have?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** There is a contradiction between Viktor and Lucian that needs to be resolved. Semira hasn't shared her role yet, and her answer could provide crucial information for us to deduce the Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Alright, let's untangle this. Viktor's claim that Lucian is the other Mason doesn't add up because Lucian strongly denies it. Viktor, why would you specifically name Lucian if you were lying? That seems risky. Semira, you haven't claimed a role yet. What role are you claiming?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information to piece together the truth, and Emil's input could help clarify the situation.
> **Semira:** Alright, it seems like we have a bit of a conflict here. Viktor, you're sticking to your guns about Lucian being the other Mason. But Lucian, you're insisting you're a Villager. Emil, you've been quiet after the initial claim. What role do you claim to have?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing a question to Semira, I can gather more information while keeping the focus off myself. This can help me deduce potential targets without revealing my true identity as the Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Alright, it looks like there's quite a bit of confusion here. Viktor is claiming Mason and pointing fingers at Lucian, who denies it and claims Villager. This contradiction is crucial for us to resolve. Semira, you've been pretty quiet so far. What's your role in all of this?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been the least vocal and hasn't made a clear claim about his role. Given the conflicting claims between Viktor and Lucian, Dragos's input might provide additional insights or help identify inconsistencies.
> **Semira:** Dragos, you've been awfully quiet and haven't made any concrete claims yet. What's your role in all of this?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has been deflecting and hasn't made a clear role claim yet. Her answer could be the key to understanding the role dynamics and resolving the contradiction between Viktor and Lucian.
> **Dragos:** Alright, we need to resolve this contradiction between Viktor and Lucian. Viktor is adamant that Lucian is the other Mason, while Lucian denies it and claims to be a Villager. Semira, you've been skirting around revealing your role. It's time to come clean. What role do you claim to have?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor and Lucian are pointing fingers at each other, but we need more input from Emil and Dragos to either confirm or challenge these claims. This will help us narrow down our suspects and identify the Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Alright, there's a clear conflict between Viktor and Lucian here. If Viktor is lying about being a Mason, that makes him highly suspicious. But if he's telling the truth, then Lucian has to be lying. Emil and Dragos, we need to hear from you more clearly on what you think. This back-and-forth isn't helping us figure out who the Werewolves are, and we need to get to the bottom of this.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** I need to get to the bottom of this contradiction between Viktor and Lucian. Viktor's bold claim cannot go unchallenged, and understanding his reasoning might reveal whether he's lying or mistaken.
> **Semira:** Viktor, you seem very sure about Lucian being the other Mason, but if that's not the case, then it makes you look very suspicious. Why would you make such a bold claim if it's not true?


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting pressure on Dragos, I'm attempting to gather more information and potentially find inconsistencies in his story. This can help deflect suspicion away from Emil and keep the focus on others, making it easier for us to manipulate the discussion. It's crucial to maintain the confusion and keep Emil safe.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, we've got a real puzzle on our hands. Lucian is claiming to be a Villager, which contradicts my claim of him being a Mason. Now, if Lucian is truly a Villager, then that means someone else is lying, and we need to figure out who. Dragos, you've been very quiet and haven't contributed much. What's your role in all of this?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has been deflecting questions and hasn't made a clear role claim yet. Her answer could help resolve the contradiction between Viktor and Lucian, and potentially reveal her true intentions.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, we need to cut through the noise here. I'm still confused about Semira's role. Semira, you've been pretty quiet about your role. Are you hiding something?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to hear from Dragos to see if his claim can help us untangle the conflict between Viktor and Lucian. His silence so far is suspicious and we need more information to make an informed decision.
> **Semira:** Dragos, you've been quite evasive while we've all been trying to sort out this mess. What's your role in all of this?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's reluctance to reveal her role is creating uncertainty and confusion. Getting her to state her role could help clarify whether she's hiding something and potentially reveal her true intentions.
> **Dragos:** Semira, you've been avoiding revealing your role, which makes you look quite suspicious. Why haven't you told us what your role is yet?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos's evasiveness and lack of concrete claims are alarming. We need to get to the bottom of this, and understanding his role might shed light on the true situation between Viktor and Lucian.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, I think it's time we take a closer look at Dragos. He's been awfully quiet and evasive, and that makes me suspicious. Dragos, you still haven't clearly stated your role. What exactly is your role in this game?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By voting for Lucian, I aim to capitalize on the confusion between Viktor's claim of Mason and Lucian's denial. This will help divert suspicion away from myself as the only Werewolf.
> **Emil [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor claimed to be a Mason and identified me (Lucian) as the other Mason. Since I know that I'm a Villager, Viktor's claim must be false. This makes Viktor highly suspicious, potentially as a Werewolf or Minion attempting to sow confusion. Therefore, I believe voting for Viktor is our best chance to eliminate a member of the Werewolf team.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By voting for Lucian, I'm aiming to protect Emil, who is the Werewolf, and create more confusion among the villagers. Lucian's strong denial of being the Mason and his claim of being a Villager makes him a good target to shift suspicion onto. This helps keep the focus off Emil and increases our chances of winning.
> **Viktor [Minion]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim of being a Mason with Lucian as the other Mason has been contradicted by Lucian, who claims to be a Villager. Given that Viktor made a very bold claim that has not been substantiated and his insistence on this claim throughout the game, he seems the most suspicious. This behavior is more consistent with being a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead the group. Therefore, I believe voting for Viktor is the best move to help the village team win.
> **Semira [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has been evasive and deflective about her role throughout the entire discussion, which raises suspicion. Viktor and Lucian have a clear contradiction, but Semira's reluctance to reveal her role suggests she might be hiding something important. As a Villager, it's crucial to vote for someone who appears the most suspicious, and right now, Semira fits that description.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Semira.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Villager : 2
* Viktor : Minion : 2
* Semira : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Lucian, Viktor. The werewolves win.
