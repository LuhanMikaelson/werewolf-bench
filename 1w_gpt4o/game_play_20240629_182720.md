## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Lucian. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Andrei is a minion and is aware that Lucian is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Marius. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Cristina. They are thinking about their action.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards gives me a chance to see if any powerful roles (like Werewolf or Minion) are there, which can help narrow down the possibilities and provide valuable information to the Village team during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By initiating the conversation and encouraging others to share their night actions, I can gather information and look for inconsistencies in their stories. This can help me identify the Seer and Masons, while diverting suspicion away from myself.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's get to the bottom of this. I’m just a simple Villager trying to survive the night. I think it's crucial we hear from everyone about what they did or saw last night. Let's start piecing together the puzzle. So, who wants to go first?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** By asking about unusual or significant actions, we can start gathering information that might help identify the Werewolves. This is especially useful if someone can corroborate or contradict another player's claim.
> **Cristina:** I think it's important to figure out if anyone has concrete information from last night. Did anyone see something unusual or significant?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** If we can get the Seer to reveal themselves and share their information, it will help us understand who might be hiding as a Werewolf. Of course, as the Minion, I can use this information to steer the conversation and protect Lucian.
> **Andrei:** Alright, I think it's important to start narrowing down our options. I'm a Villager, so I don't have any special information, but I'm curious to hear if anyone here has a role with night actions. Specifically, I'm wondering if we have a Seer who can give us some insight. If you are the Seer, did you check anyone's role or look at the center cards?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian hasn't provided any information about his role yet, and it's important to get everyone to state their roles to identify inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, I think it's time to start getting concrete. Andrei, you mentioned you were a Villager, but that doesn't really help us much. Lucian, you introduced the discussion but didn't claim a role right away. Can you clarify what role you have?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Dragos's concern, I establish myself as cooperative and transparent. Directing the question to Cristina, who hasn't claimed a role yet, helps shift the focus while encouraging more players to reveal their roles, making it easier to identify inconsistencies and root out the Seer or Masons.
> **Lucian:** Alright Dragos, fair point. I didn't claim a role initially because I wanted to gather some information first. But since you asked, I'm claiming to be a Villager. Now, Cristina, you were quick to ask about concrete information. Did you see or learn anything significant last night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to provide everyone with concrete information that narrows down the possibilities. By revealing that two of those cards are in the center, we can start to focus on the remaining roles and identify potential Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, I have some information to share. Last night, I looked at two of the center cards. I saw a Mason and a Villager there. This means that one of the Masons is definitely in the center, and there are only two Villagers left in the game aside from Andrei and Lucian who have claimed to be Villagers. If anyone else claims to be a Villager, we need to question that.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** By confirming Cristina's information, I can subtly hint at my knowledge without revealing my role directly. This keeps the pressure on anyone else who might falsely claim to be a Villager and helps narrow down our suspects for the Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Interesting, Cristina. That definitely lines up with what I know. If there’s a Mason and a Villager in the center, then we can confirm that there are only two villagers among us aside from Andrei and Lucian. But that also means we have to be very careful about anyone else claiming to be a Villager. Let's keep digging. Does anyone else have concrete information or want to claim a role?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question to Marius, who seems to have corroborating information, it encourages him to reveal his role and any night actions. This helps gather more details and identify inconsistencies without drawing suspicion towards myself.
> **Lucian:** Okay, Cristina, thanks for that information. I think we should hear from Marius next. Marius, you mentioned that Cristina's information lines up with what you know. Can you clarify what your role is and what you know from last night?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** By putting pressure on Dragos, I can gauge his reaction and potentially identify inconsistencies in his story. This helps narrow down possible Werewolf suspects.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, we need to focus. Cristina mentioned seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center, which aligns with what I know. This means that any additional Villager claims could be suspicious. Andrei and Lucian have both claimed to be Villagers, but since we have to be cautious about over-claiming, I'm particularly suspicious of Dragos. Dragos, you've been pushing for answers but haven't claimed a role yourself. What role do you have?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been quick to point fingers without offering any clear information about his own role. This could be a tactic to divert attention from himself if he is a Werewolf or Minion. By pressing him for details, we might expose inconsistencies or force him to reveal something useful.
> **Dragos:** Alright Marius, you seem pretty eager to deflect suspicion onto me. I find that suspicious in itself. So, let's turn the spotlight on you. What role are you claiming, and can you provide any concrete information from last night?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos hasn't given us any concrete information or claimed a role yet. His defensive behavior when questioned makes him a prime suspect for being a Werewolf. Let's put the pressure on him and see how he reacts.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, Dragos is deflecting questions back onto me without providing any clear information. That seems like a classic tactic to avoid revealing his role. I find that very suspicious.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius has been deflecting and hasn't clearly stated his role or provided concrete information. By pressing him for details, we might be able to figure out if he's hiding something or if he's genuinely on the village team.
> **Cristina:** Alright, based on what we've heard so far, I think we need to focus on Marius and Dragos. Marius, you've been quick to accuse Dragos without providing any concrete information yourself. So, what role are you claiming, and what did you see or learn last night?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos has been avoiding giving any clear information and has been deflecting questions back onto me. This defensive behavior is typical of someone who is hiding something, potentially being a Werewolf. By accusing him directly, I put pressure on him to reveal more or risk being exposed.
> **Marius:** Alright Dragos, enough with the deflections. You've been avoiding giving any concrete information and it makes you look very suspicious. I think you might be the Werewolf here.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been deflecting and accusing others without providing any concrete information about his own role, which raises suspicion that he might be trying to hide his identity as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and consider the facts. Cristina, you mentioned seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center. This means we're short one Mason and one Villager. Andrei and Lucian have both claimed to be Villagers. Marius, you've been quick to accuse without revealing anything about your role. To me, that seems like a deflective tactic. I'm inclined to think you're hiding something. How do you respond to that?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos's defensive behavior and lack of clear information make him the most suspicious. By accusing him, I'm putting pressure on him to reveal more or risk being exposed as the Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Alright, everyone, let's focus on the facts we have so far. Cristina claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, which fits with my knowledge. That leaves two Villagers unaccounted for, which are claimed by Lucian and Andrei. That also means there should be no more Villager claims. Dragos, you've been deflecting and avoiding giving any clear role. I'm going to say it outright: I think Dragos is our Werewolf.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been deflecting and avoiding giving any concrete role information, which raises suspicion. By pressing him to reveal his role, we might expose inconsistencies or force him to provide useful information that can help us narrow down the suspects.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's focus. We've heard a lot but I want to get some clarity. Marius, you've been so quick to point fingers, but haven't given us any solid info about what role you actually have. Are you a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect them? We need to hear what your role is.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina's information aligns with my knowledge. With two Villagers already claimed and Dragos avoiding giving any clear information, it's highly suspicious. We need to focus on Dragos to ensure the safety of the village.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's think about this carefully. Cristina saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, and we know there are only two more Villagers among us. Andrei and Lucian both claimed to be Villagers, and if they are telling the truth, then Dragos is definitely hiding something. Based on Dragos' deflective behavior and lack of concrete information, I am convinced that Dragos is our Werewolf. Let's vote to eliminate him and protect the village!


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Marius, I can steer attention away from Lucian and create confusion among the Villagers. This will help protect Lucian and increase the chances of the Werewolf team winning.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, I think we need to take a closer look at Marius. He's been very quick to accuse Dragos without providing any concrete information about his own role. Marius, you've been pushing hard against Dragos, but you haven't told us what your role is. Why haven't you been more forthcoming?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina's information aligns with my knowledge, and the behavior of Andrei and Lucian seems consistent with their claims. Dragos's defensive and evasive behavior makes him the most suspicious. By focusing our votes on Dragos, we increase our chances of eliminating the Werewolf and protecting the village.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's think about this logically. We have established there are only two Villagers and Cristina has confirmed that she saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Andrei and Lucian have claimed to be Villagers, which means we need to be very cautious about any other claims. Dragos, you've been avoiding giving any clear information and deflecting questions. I'm convinced Dragos is our Werewolf. Let's vote to eliminate him to protect the village!


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has consistently avoided revealing his role and has been too eager to point fingers at me. This deflective behavior is highly suspicious, suggesting he might be trying to hide his true identity. By focusing on him, we might be able to expose his true role and protect the village.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, here's what I think. Marius has been very quick to accuse me without providing any clear information about his own role. He's been deflecting and not giving us anything concrete. I believe Marius is either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf. Let's take a closer look at his behavior and think about it logically.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Given that Cristina claimed to see a Mason and a Villager in the center and both Andrei and I claimed to be Villagers, the focus has shifted onto Dragos and Marius. Marius has been more aggressive in accusing Dragos but hasn't provided concrete information about his role, which might be a ploy. However, Dragos has been deflective and not forthcoming with any role, making him the more suspicious candidate. To protect myself as a Werewolf and align with Marius' narrative, I vote for Dragos.
> **Lucian [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Based on the information gathered during the day phase, Marius' claims align with the cards I saw in the center. Dragos has been deflecting questions and avoiding giving any clear information about his role, which is suspicious behavior. This aligns with the pattern of a Werewolf or a Minion trying to protect the Werewolf. Thus, I believe voting for Dragos is the best move to protect the village.
> **Cristina [Seer]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** Dragos has been deflecting and avoiding giving any clear information about his role. This aligns with the behavior of someone trying to hide their identity. Marius and Cristina have provided concrete information that makes Dragos' actions appear suspicious. Voting for Dragos will help protect Lucian, ensuring our Werewolf team wins.
> **Andrei [Minion]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been consistently deflecting and accusing others without providing any concrete information about his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and suggests he could be the Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf. By voting for Marius, we can potentially expose his true role and help protect the village.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina's information aligns with my knowledge, confirming there are only two Villagers aside from the center cards. Andrei and Lucian both claimed to be Villagers, which fits the count. Dragos has been evasive and deflective throughout the discussion, making him the most suspicious. Therefore, I believe Dragos is the Werewolf.
> **Marius [Mason]:** I am voting for Dragos.


The votes were:
* Dragos : Villager : 4
* Marius : Mason : 1



>***GAME:*** Dragos was killed. The werewolves win.
