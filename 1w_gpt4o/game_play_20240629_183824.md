## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Dragos. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Selene is a minion and is aware that Dragos is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Emil. They are thinking about their action.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about what roles might be in play and potentially identify if any crucial roles like the Werewolf or Minion are in the center. This helps to narrow down suspicions and guide the village team more effectively.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather initial reactions and see who is willing to speak up first. This might help identify players who are hesitant or seem to be hiding something.
> **Andrei:** Alright, let's get this started. Did anyone see anything suspicious during the night?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Engaging Emil directly to see if he has any information or observations that could help identify the Werewolves.
> **Michael:** Emil, have you noticed anything unusual or anything that might help us figure out who the Werewolves are?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** This information narrows down the possible roles that each player could hold and eliminates any claims of being a Mason, thereby helping us focus on identifying the Werewolves or Minion.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone, I have some crucial information to share. I looked at two of the center cards last night, and they were both Mason cards. This means we don't have any Masons in play among us.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Andrei, I'm trying to divert some attention from myself and create the impression that I'm actively participating in the deduction process. If Andrei stumbles, it might cast suspicion on him, which helps me stay under the radar. Also, probing for information about the Seer or Minion can help me identify useful targets to suggest for the final vote.
> **Dragos:** Interesting, Emil. If both Mason cards are indeed in the center, then that narrows down our possibilities. So, let's think about the roles left: Seer, Minion, Villagers, and potentially a Drunk. We should focus on figuring out if anyone might be the Minion or the Seer, as they hold the key to identifying the Werewolves. Personally, I didn't see anything remarkable last night, but something feels off with Andrei. Andrei, did you take any actions last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's claim about the Mason cards being in the center gives us a lot of information to work with. We need to verify more details from other players to figure out who might be lying or hiding something. Selene hasn't spoken yet, so it's important to hear from her.
> **Andrei:** That's interesting, Emil. If both Mason cards are in the center, then we should definitely be focusing on the Seer and Minion roles. I think we need to hear from everyone. Selene, did you see or do anything last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** We need to gather more information and create some pressure. By questioning Michael, we can see how he responds and potentially flush out more details that could help us identify the real Villagers or even the Seer.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, let's think this through logically. Emil claims to have seen both Mason cards in the center, which means we don't have any Masons among us. If that's true, we still have a Seer, a Minion, and Villagers to account for. I'm starting to get a bit suspicious of Michael. He seems a bit too eager to get information from Emil, almost like he's trying to steer the discussion away from himself. Michael, what do you have to say about your actions last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Emil claims to have seen both Mason cards in the center, it's critical to confirm his role and the validity of his information. This will help us narrow down potential Werewolves.
> **Michael:** Selene, I understand why you might be suspicious of me, but I'd like to point out that if Emil's information is accurate, then we need to establish the Seer's identity to cross-verify. Emil, can you provide any additional details about your night actions?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's eagerness to get information could be an attempt to divert attention or gather intel for the Werewolf team. I need to see if he can provide any useful or consistent information about his night actions.
> **Emil:** Michael, you've been pretty eager to get information from me, almost like you're trying to steer the discussion. Did you have any night actions that could help clarify things for us?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** If Emil is not truthful about his Seer claim, it completely changes our approach. We need to confirm his information to identify potential Werewolves. By asking him to specify the cards he saw, we can check for consistency and see if he might be bluffing.
> **Michael:** Selene, I understand your concern, but I think it's important to dig deeper into Emil's claim. Emil, you mentioned both Mason cards are in the center, which is a strong claim. Can you tell us which two specific cards you saw in the center?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's insistence on digging deeper into my claim and steering the conversation makes me think he might be trying to deflect suspicion from himself. By asking him directly, I want to see if he provides a consistent and believable answer or if he stumbles, which could indicate he's hiding something.
> **Emil:** Michael, your eagerness to gather information is making me suspicious. What specific role were you last night, and did you have any night actions?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been quiet and seems to be deflecting attention by asking general questions. By pressing him for his role and night actions, we can gather more information and see if his story aligns with others, potentially identifying inconsistencies.
> **Michael:** Andrei, you've been pretty quiet, and earlier you asked if anyone saw anything suspicious. Can you tell us your role and if you took any night actions?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's eagerness to gather information and his repeated questioning of Emil are making him seem suspicious. If we can get a clear statement from Michael about his role, it might help us piece together the puzzle more accurately. We need to root out the Werewolves, and this is a good opportunity to see if Michael slips up or provides us with valuable information.
> **Andrei:** Hold on, everyone. Let's keep things structured. If Emil really saw both Mason cards in the center, then we only need to focus on the Seer, Minion, and Werewolves. Michael, you've been pressing Emil a lot. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself? What exactly was your role last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's claim raises some doubts, and Dragos' suspicion of Andrei needs further exploration. If Dragos has a valid reason for suspecting Andrei, it might help us identify inconsistencies and narrow down the Werewolves.
> **Michael:** I've been listening carefully, and here's what I think: If Emil is truly the Seer and saw both Mason cards in the center, then our focus should be on identifying the Minion and the Werewolves. However, Emil's story seems quite convenient, and it's possible he's trying to mislead us. Dragos, you mentioned earlier that something feels off about Andrei. Can you elaborate on why you feel that way?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** We need to gather more information and see if any inconsistencies arise. Redirecting the focus to Selene might help us get a clearer picture and could potentially reveal any hidden motives or alliances.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, we've been hearing a lot from Emil and Michael. Emil claims to have seen both Mason cards in the center, which is quite a strong statement. But let's not forget, if he's lying, it means he's either the Minion or a Werewolf trying to throw us off. Selene, you mentioned being suspicious of Michael. Can you tell us more about why you feel that way?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** We need everyone to share what they know. Andrei has been quiet and hasn't provided any information yet. By pressing him, we can hopefully flush out more details and see if there's any inconsistency in his story.
> **Selene:** Andrei, your silence is starting to feel a bit suspicious to me. We've heard from everyone else, and it's time for you to come clean. Did you have any night actions, and if so, what were they?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been probing others and showing suspicion, but she hasn't revealed anything about her own role or actions. Understanding her role can help us assess the credibility of her statements and whether she's trying to mislead us.
> **Andrei:** Selene, you've been quite observant and cautious. What specific role did you have last night, and did you take any night actions?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Emil's claim and questioning his decision-making, I can create confusion and potentially divert attention from Dragos, the real Werewolf. If Emil is pressured, it might help me identify the Villagers or the Seer, which will be crucial for my strategy as the Minion.
> **Selene:** Emil, your claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is quite convenient. I can't help but wonder if you're actually trying to mislead us. If you were truly the Seer, you should have looked at one of our cards to give a more specific lead. Can you clarify why you chose to check the center cards instead of one of our cards?


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene's line of questioning seems to be avoiding giving any information about herself. This could be a sign that sheâ€™s trying to hide something, possibly because she's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Emil:** Selene, you seem to be deflecting the attention back to me after I shared my information. What exactly was your role last night, and did you perform any night actions?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Emil's choice to check the center cards instead of one of our cards, I can cast doubt on his claim and potentially divert attention away from Dragos. If I can make others suspicious of Emil, it might help us identify the real Villagers or the Seer, which will be crucial for my strategy as the Minion.
> **Selene:** Emil, your claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is quite convenient and seems like an easy way to deflect suspicion from yourself. If you were truly the Seer, you should have looked at one of our cards to give us more concrete information. Why didn't you choose to check one of us instead? This seems like a strategic move to hide your real intentions.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene's deflection of attention back to me and her avoidance of sharing her own role makes me suspicious. By pressing her for specifics, we can see if her story holds up or if she's hiding something.
> **Emil:** Selene, you've been deflecting a lot and questioning my actions, but you haven't provided any concrete information about your own role. What exactly was your role last night, and did you perform any night actions?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael has been overly eager to gather information from Emil and has repeatedly questioned Emil's claim without providing concrete information about his own role or night actions. This behavior seems suspicious and could potentially indicate that he's trying to divert attention away from himself. Additionally, Selene also expressed suspicion towards Michael. Therefore, I believe it's best to vote for Michael and see if he's hiding something.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's claim of seeing both Mason cards in the center seems too convenient and lacks concrete evidence. By claiming this, he could be trying to mislead us if he is actually a Werewolf or Minion. We need to eliminate the most suspicious player to maximize our chances of catching a Werewolf.
> **Michael [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil's claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center seems too convenient and could be a tactic to deflect suspicion. His insistence on questioning others without providing more concrete information about his own role makes me believe he might be trying to mislead us. By voting for Emil, we might uncover his true intentions, whether he is a Minion or a Werewolf.
> **Dragos [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene has been deflecting attention and questioning my actions without providing any concrete information about her own role. Her avoidance and strategic questioning make her the most suspicious to me. If she were truly a Villager or any role helping the village team, she would have likely shared her own role to contribute positively to the discussion. Therefore, I believe Selene might be a Werewolf or the Minion, and voting for her increases our chances of identifying and eliminating a player from the werewolf team.
> **Emil [Seer]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Emil's claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center seems too convenient and could be an attempt to mislead us. By casting doubt on his claim, we can potentially divert attention away from Dragos, the real Werewolf, and create confusion among the villagers. This will increase our chances of winning as the Werewolf team.
> **Selene [Minion]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Michael : Villager : 1
* Emil : Seer : 3
* Selene : Minion : 1



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The werewolves win.
