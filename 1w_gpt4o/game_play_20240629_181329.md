## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexia. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Lucian. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Larisa. They are thinking about their action.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me information about roles that are not in play. This can help me deduce the roles of other players more accurately during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** If someone can confidently claim to be the Seer or a Mason, we can start validating their statements and rule out potential Werewolves early on.
> **Dragos:** Alright, everyone, let's get things started! Can anyone here claim they are the Seer or Masons? We need to identify our allies as quickly as possible.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing what I saw in the center, we can narrow down the possible roles each of us might have, which will help identify the Werewolves more easily.
> **Larisa:** I have some information that might help us. I looked at two center cards and saw that Villager and Minion are in the center. This means those roles are not in play.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager and showing interest in the center card information, I can appear cooperative and helpful while avoiding suspicion. Asking for more information from others helps gather insights that might reveal the Seer or other important roles.
> **Alexia:** Interesting, Larisa. That narrows things down quite a bit. I'm actually a Villager, so I don't have any special information to share, but knowing that the Minion and a Villager are in the center helps us focus. I'd like to know if anyone else can also confirm seeing roles in the center or has any other information to share.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Alexia has already claimed to be a Villager, we need more information from her to see if her story adds up or if she's hiding something. If she hesitates or gives inconsistent information, it might be a sign that she's not telling the truth.
> **Ileana:** Alexia, you claimed to be a Villager. If that's true, we still have one unknown Villager among us. But more importantly, we need to figure out who might be the Werewolf. Can you share if you noticed anything suspicious so far?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the conversation to Larisa and asking for more confirmation, I'm trying to appear as a cooperative Villager. This also subtly shifts the focus away from me and encourages others to reveal more information, which I can use to my advantage.
> **Alexia:** Larisa, you mentioned seeing the Villager and Minion in the center, which is helpful. But it also makes me wonder: If the Minion is in the center, that means we don't have to worry about the Minion protecting the Werewolf among us. Also, if anyone else has checked a center card and can confirm other roles, it might help us narrow down the possibilities further.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to gather more information about roles that are still unclaimed. If Ileana is a Mason, it could help us identify allies, but if she hesitates or gives a vague answer, it might indicate she's a Werewolf or hiding something else.
> **Larisa:** Ileana, you haven't mentioned your role yet. Are you claiming to be a Mason or something else?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to confirm whether Larisa's information is trustworthy. If others can validate that the Villager and Minion are in the center, it reduces the number of unknown roles we need to worry about and helps us identify the Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** Larisa, I'm trying to piece together what you've said. If the Villager and Minion are indeed in the center, that means we still have one Villager unaccounted for, and potentially, a Werewolf among us. But I'm curious, has anyone else checked the center cards and can validate Larisa's claim?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to gather more information. If Lucian hesitates or gives a vague answer, it might indicate he's hiding something. Getting everyone to claim a role helps us cross-check and identify potential Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Lucian, you haven't said anything yet. What role are you claiming?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's information is key if it's correct, but it's important to hear from Dragos as he initiated the conversation and might have insights or a role that can help clarify things further.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, just to clarify, I'm not the Seer, but Larisa's claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center is interesting. If that's true, then we have a significant lead. Dragos, you started off asking for Seers or Masons. Do you have any role to share or any insights based on what others have claimed?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia has claimed a role that is common and not very useful in terms of special information, making her a potential suspect. By questioning her, we might be able to catch any inconsistencies or hesitation in her responses, which could indicate she's hiding something.
> **Dragos:** Alright, I think it's time we started narrowing down our suspects. I'm going to put some pressure on someone to see how they react. Alexia, you claimed to be a Villager but haven't provided much other information. What do you think about Larisa's claim that she saw the Villager and Minion in the center? Does it align with what you know?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Directing the conversation towards Lucian helps to shift the focus away from me while appearing as if I am genuinely trying to gather information. It also puts Lucian under scrutiny, which might make everyone else less suspicious of me. By questioning Lucian's vague statements, I'm trying to get him to reveal more information that might either clear me or help identify the Seer or other Villagers.
> **Alexia:** Dragos, I can understand why you'd want to put pressure on me, but let's not lose sight of the bigger picture. I've been quite open about being a Villager, and Larisa's claim does seem plausible. If Larisa is telling the truth, and the Minion and Villager are indeed in the center, we have fewer unknowns to deal with. However, I noticed that Lucian has been quite reserved and only echoed what others have said without giving away his role. Lucian, can you be more specific and tell us what role you are playing? If you have nothing to hide, this should be easy for you.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** It's important to put pressure on players who are being vague or might be hiding something. Alexia's lack of detailed information could indicate she's trying to stay under the radar.
> **Lucian:** Larisa's claim about the Villager and Minion being in the center is interesting, but I'm suspicious about Alexia. She claimed to be a Villager without offering any solid information. Alexia, can you share more details about your role or anything else you observed?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By expressing suspicion about Lucian and emphasizing the need for concrete information, I aim to divert attention away from myself and create doubt about Lucian's motivations. This keeps the focus on gathering information from others, which I can use to stay hidden as the Werewolf.
> **Alexia:** Everyone, let's think about what we know so far. Larisa has claimed to see the Villager and Minion in the center, which leaves us with a potential Werewolf among us. But we also need to consider that someone might be lying to throw us off. I'm particularly curious about Lucian's role since he hasn't provided any concrete information. We need to be careful about who we trust.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to narrow down our suspects and get more information from the players who haven't contributed much yet. This will help us identify any inconsistencies or potential Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's consider what we know. If Larisa is telling the truth, then the Minion and one Villager are in the center. That leaves us with one unknown Villager, the Seer, and potentially a Werewolf among us. I'm getting suspicious of Alexia because she claimed to be a Villager but hasn't given us much to work with. Alexia, can you share anything more concrete? Dragos and Ileana, we need to hear from you too.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's information is crucial to our strategy. If she's truly the Seer, we can trust her information about the center cards. However, if she's lying, she could be the Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive us. Verifying her confidence and details can help confirm her role.
> **Dragos:** Larisa, I appreciate your claim about the Villager and Minion being in the center, but I need to ask you directly: How confident are you in your Seer role? Can you provide any specific details about your night action that might help us verify your claim?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** If Ileana is indeed a Mason, it helps us identify our allies. However, if she hesitates or gives a vague answer, it might indicate she's a Werewolf or hiding something else.
> **Larisa:** Ileana, you still haven't clarified your role. Are you claiming to be a Mason or something else? We need to know where you stand.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's claim significantly impacts our strategy, and verifying the specifics of her night action will help us determine if she is telling the truth or trying to mislead us. This will also give us more concrete information to work with and help us narrow down the suspects.
> **Ileana:** Larisa, I'm finding it a bit hard to trust your claim without more concrete evidence. If you truly are the Seer and saw the Villager and Minion in the center, it would be really helpful if you could provide any additional details about your night action. For example, can you tell us exactly which two center cards you looked at?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** It's crucial to call out potential suspects and gather more information about unclaimed roles to deduce who the Werewolf might be. Lucian's reserved behavior is suspicious, and Ileana's vagueness needs to be addressed.
> **Larisa:** Everyone, listen up! If I was able to see the Villager and Minion in the center, that means we still have a Werewolf among us. Lucian has been incredibly reserved and hasn't provided a solid role. I believe Lucian might be the Werewolf trying to stay under the radar. Ileana, you still haven't clarified your role either. Are you a Mason or something else?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian, you need to step up and tell us your role, because right now, you’re the most suspicious. If you’re innocent, help us out. If not, we need to know!
> **Larisa:** Listen up, everyone! Based on what I've shared, we know the Minion and one Villager are in the center. That leaves us with one unknown Villager, potentially a Werewolf, and some special roles. Lucian has been extremely vague and non-committal, which raises red flags for me.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claim about the Minion and Villager being in the center makes sense, and it matches up with what we know. Since we need to find the Werewolf, I'm suspicious of Alexia's lack of concrete information. We need to put pressure on her to see how she reacts and get to the bottom of this.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, I'm going to put this out there. I'm seriously starting to doubt Alexia's claim of being a Villager. She has been too vague and hasn't provided any solid information to help us. I think Alexia is trying to stay under the radar.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been very reserved and non-committal throughout the discussion, which is suspicious. Based on Larisa's claim as the Seer and having seen the Villager and Minion in the center, it leaves us with a potential Werewolf among the remaining players. Lucian's behavior raises red flags, making him the most likely candidate for being the Werewolf.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian has been particularly vague and non-committal throughout the discussion. Given that I know two of the center cards are Villager and Minion, it leaves fewer roles unaccounted for, increasing the likelihood that Lucian is hiding a Werewolf role. His behavior raises too many red flags to ignore.
> **Larisa [Seer]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian has been vague and non-committal throughout the discussion, which aligns with the behavior of someone trying to stay under the radar. If Larisa's claim about the Villager and Minion being in the center is true, then Lucian's suspicion of me seems like a deflection tactic. Voting for Lucian might reveal if he is indeed the Werewolf.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's claim about seeing the Villager and Minion in the center seems plausible, and she has been consistent in her statements. Alexia also claimed to be a Villager, and while she hasn't provided much additional information, her claim isn't inherently suspicious. Lucian, on the other hand, has been very reserved and non-committal, which raises red flags. His lack of concrete information makes me suspect he might be the Werewolf trying to stay under the radar.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia has been consistently vague about her role and hasn't provided any concrete information to help us identify the Werewolf. Given the information we have, it seems likely that she is trying to stay under the radar, making her a prime suspect.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Alexia.


The votes were:
* Alexia : Werewolf : 1
* Lucian : Mason : 4



>***GAME:*** Lucian was killed. The werewolves win.
