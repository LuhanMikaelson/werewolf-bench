## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I am the only Mason and I know the other Mason card is in the center, if someone falsely claims to be a Mason, it would likely reveal them as a Werewolf or Minion. This will help identify a potential liar and narrow down the suspects.
> **Kraven:** I've noticed no one has mentioned being a Mason so far. If there is another Mason out there, they should come forward now.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to cast suspicion on others to protect myself. Viktor has been quiet, which is an easy target to accuse without raising too many eyebrows. It also opens the floor for others to share information that could potentially be misleading.
> **Alexia:** I'm a bit suspicious of Viktor. He hasn't said much, and usually that means he's trying to stay under the radar. If anyone has any concrete information, now's the time to share.


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** Kraven's eagerness to draw out Masons could be a ploy to identify non-Werewolf players and eliminate the village's power roles. By casting suspicion on Kraven, I'm diverting attention away from Alexia and sowing distrust among the other players.
> **Emil:** I find it interesting that Kraven is pushing for a Mason to come forward. This could be a strategy to identify and target villagers. I think Kraven might be a Werewolf trying to manipulate us.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's immediate suspicion of Kraven without much evidence could be an attempt to deflect attention away from himself, indicating he might be hiding something.
> **Vladimir:** Emil, you seem very quick to point fingers at Kraven. Why are you so convinced that he might be a Werewolf?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Vladimir on the spot, I can divert attention away from Alexia and create further mistrust among the villagers. His response might also give us more clues about who the villagers and masons are, which will help me protect Alexia.
> **Emil:** Vladimir, you seem very calm and collected. This game is all about deduction and suspicion, and yet you haven't really contributed much. What role do you have?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's initial push for the Masons to reveal themselves could be a tactic to identify villagers or special roles for the Werewolf team. This needs to be clarified further.
> **Vladimir:** Kraven, you started the discussion about the Masons, but no one has confirmed being a Mason yet. Why are you so keen on finding the Masons? Are you trying to gather information for the Werewolves?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's quick accusation without much backing could be a tactic to divert attention away from himself. By putting Emil on the spot, I hope to see if he falters or provides a weak argument, which could indicate he's trying to cover something up.
> **Kraven:** Emil, you seem very eager to accuse, but you haven't provided any solid evidence. Why did you jump to accuse me so quickly?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Vladimir on the spot, it creates a diversion and shifts the focus away from Alexia. If Vladimir stumbles or behaves defensively, it can raise suspicion towards him, making him a potential target for the villagers. This helps protect Alexia and keeps the heat off her.
> **Emil:** Vladimir, you seem to be careful in your questions and responses. You've been deflecting attention away from yourself and towards others. Is there a reason you're staying so quiet? What are you trying to hide?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's aggressive stance against Kraven could indicate that he's trying to shift the attention away from himself. By asking Emil directly about his role, we can gauge his reaction and gather more information to identify the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Emil, your immediate accusation of Kraven without much evidence seems suspicious to me. Are you trying to deflect attention away from yourself? What role do you have?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Vladimir on the spot, it creates a diversion and shifts the focus away from Alexia. If Vladimir stumbles or behaves defensively, it can raise suspicion towards him, making him a potential target for the villagers. This helps protect Alexia and keeps the heat off her.
> **Emil:** Vladimir, you've been quite defensive since the beginning. You’re quick to deflect and accuse me when I’m merely trying to get to the truth. It seems like a strategy to keep the suspicion off yourself. What role do you have?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's behavior has been overly aggressive and accusatory without solid evidence. This could be a tactic to deflect suspicion away from himself, suggesting that he might have a hidden agenda. It's essential to probe him further to understand his true intentions and role.
> **Vladimir:** Emil, I'm not convinced by your accusations. You jumped on Kraven very aggressively without much to go on, and now you're deflecting onto me. Why are you so quick to attack others without providing evidence? What are you trying to hide?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Kraven of being a Werewolf, I'm attempting to divert attention away from Alexia. This will create suspicion around Kraven and potentially cause the villagers to vote for him, ensuring the safety of the remaining Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Kraven, your insistence on finding the Masons feels like it's coming from a place of fear. Are you worried that the Masons will reveal their identities and disrupt your plans? You've been very vocal about flushing them out, which to me seems like a classic Werewolf tactic. I'm inclined to believe that you're trying to eliminate the village's power roles.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's aggressive behavior and quick accusations seem like a diversion tactic. By putting him on the spot, I hope to either catch him off guard or force him to provide a weak argument, which could indicate he's trying to cover something up. This will help me and the other villagers narrow down the suspects.
> **Kraven:** Emil, your immediate accusations without any solid backing make you look very suspicious. Why are you so quick to accuse without providing any evidence?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Kraven's motives directly and aggressively, I can cast suspicion on him and divert attention away from Alexia. This tactic will keep the heat off her, creating a rift among the villagers and potentially leading them to vote against Kraven.
> **Emil:** Kraven, your eagerness to identify the Masons is making me very uncomfortable. Why do you need to know who the Masons are so badly? Are you trying to eliminate the village's power roles to protect yourself? It's a classic Werewolf move to try and out the Masons early.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's immediate and repeated accusations without solid evidence make him look very suspicious. By putting him on the spot, I hope to either catch him off guard or force him to provide a weak argument, which could indicate he's trying to cover something up. This will help me and the other villagers narrow down the suspects.
> **Kraven:** Emil, your aggressive behavior and quick accusations seem like a classic deflection tactic. If you're so confident that I'm a Werewolf, where's your evidence? Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing the suspicion towards Kraven, I can draw attention away from Alexia and create a rift among the Villagers. This helps to ensure that the focus remains on Kraven and not on anyone who might be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Emil:** Kraven, your persistent focus on identifying the Masons is raising red flags for me. It seems like you’re trying to single out those who are clearly not Werewolves to eliminate them. Why are you so fixated on finding the Masons? Are you trying to protect your Werewolf allies by removing the village's key roles?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's deflection and quiet demeanor could be a strategy to avoid suspicion. By putting him on the spot, I hope to gather more information and see if he provides a weak response that might indicate he's hiding something.
> **Kraven:** Vladimir, you have been deflecting a lot and not offering much insight. Why are you so quiet? What role do you have?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's persistence in identifying the Masons without any confirmation from others is suspicious. It could be a tactic to gather information to protect himself as a Werewolf or to eliminate the village's power roles.
> **Vladimir:** Kraven, you were the first to bring up the Masons and it feels like you're trying to gather information for a reason. Why are you so focused on the Masons? Are you trying to identify the villagers to protect yourself as a Werewolf?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia’s initial suspicion of Viktor might have some merit. By asking her to elaborate, I hope to gather more information and see if her reasoning aligns with mine or if she is trying to deflect attention.
> **Kraven:** Alexia, you mentioned suspicion of Viktor earlier, but you haven’t provided much detail on why. Can you elaborate on why you think Viktor is suspicious?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil and Vladimir have been going back and forth, which makes them seem suspicious to others. By directing attention to Kraven, I can diffuse the suspicion that's come onto me and Viktor. This also aligns with Emil's earlier suspicion of Kraven, creating a potential alliance with Emil against Kraven.
> **Alexia:** Kraven, I find it quite interesting that you're so fixated on finding the Masons. It almost seems like you're trying to gather information to protect yourself. Why do you need to know who the Masons are so badly?

>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's aggressive behavior and quick accusations without solid evidence make him look very suspicious. He might be attempting to deflect attention away from himself. By voting for Emil, I'm banking on a chance that he could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to sow confusion among the villagers.
> **Kraven [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven has been very insistent on finding the Masons, which seems like a classic Werewolf tactic to gather information and eliminate key village roles. This suspicion aligns with Emil's earlier accusations and helps to deflect attention from me.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** Kraven's persistent focus on identifying the Masons and his eagerness to draw them out raise significant red flags. This behavior is consistent with a Werewolf trying to identify and eliminate key village roles. By voting for Kraven, I aim to protect Alexia and create further mistrust among the villagers, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Emil [Minion]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's aggressive and accusatory behavior without providing solid evidence makes him the most suspicious to me.

By voting for Emil, we can potentially uncover his hidden agenda and gather more information to help identify the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been insistent on identifying the Masons, which could be a tactic to gather information for the Werewolves. His fixation on finding out the Masons' identities without providing substantial evidence or reasoning raises suspicions. This behavior aligns with what a Werewolf or Minion might do to target the village's power roles.
