## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Michael is on my team, so I need to gather information and see if anyone is lying. By questioning Ileana directly, I can start to piece together the roles and spot inconsistencies.
> **Selene:** Michael, since you and I are both Masons, we need to figure out who the Werewolves are quickly. Ileana, what card did you start the night with?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on the claim made by Selene and Michael, I can divert suspicion from myself and create uncertainty among the players. This may lead them to question the validity of the information provided by others, making it harder to pinpoint my role as the Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** I started the night as a Villager. But it's interesting that Selene immediately pointed out that she and Michael are Masons. How can we be sure they are not lying? Maybe they are trying to cover something up.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Michael directly, I can create doubt about Selene's and Michael's claim of being Masons. This challenges their credibility and sows uncertainty among the other players, making it harder for them to trust each other and easier for me to stay hidden as the Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** Selene, that's a pretty quick jump to call yourself a Mason right away. Michael, do you back up Selene's claim? Because if you two are Masons, then you're on the village team and should have no problem proving it.


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene and I are confirmed Masons, so our goal is to find the Werewolves. Ileana's defensiveness might be suspicious, but we need more information. Dracula's response could help us narrow down our suspicions.
> **Michael:** Selene is right. I am also a Mason and I can vouch for her. Now, let's focus on identifying the Werewolves. Ileana, you claimed to be a Villager, but it seems a bit defensive to immediately question our Mason claim. Dracula, what role did you start with?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's immediate doubt of Selene and Michael's Mason claim seems suspicious. If she were genuinely a Villager, her priority would be identifying Werewolves, not casting doubt on others who could potentially be allies.
> **Dracula:** Michael, if you and Selene are both Masons, that makes sense. But Ileana, why are you so quick to question their claim? If you were truly a Villager, wouldn't you be more interested in figuring out who the Werewolves are instead of immediately casting doubt?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By turning the focus on Dracula and asking him to reveal his role, I am attempting to shift the suspicion away from myself. If Dracula reveals his role, I can use that information to navigate the conversation and direct further suspicion away from myself. This also maintains the uncertainty among the players about Selene and Michael's Mason claim.
> **Ileana:** Alright, Dracula, you seem very quick to join in questioning me. If you truly are interested in finding the Werewolves, why not share your role with us instead of just backing up Selene and Michael? This way, we can have more information to work with.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to put pressure on Ileana to see how she reacts. Her defensiveness might indicate she has something to hide, and it could help us gather more information to determine whether she is a Werewolf or not.
> **Dracula:** Ileana, you seem pretty defensive and quick to doubt Selene and Michael's Mason claim. If you were truly a Villager, wouldn't you be more interested in figuring out who the Werewolves are?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting pressure on Dracula to reveal his role, I can create more uncertainty and divert suspicion away from myself. It also encourages the other players to think critically about the claims being made and question each other's motives, which can work to my advantage as the sole Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** Everyone, let's think about this carefully. Selene and Michael have claimed to be Masons, but we have no concrete proof other than their word. Dracula has been quick to back them up and question me. If Selene and Michael are truly Masons, Dracula might be trying to protect them or could be aligned with them in some way. Dracula, you haven't revealed your role yet. If you are sincere in your intentions to find the Werewolves, please share your role.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** By putting pressure on Ileana, I want to see if her defensiveness reveals any inconsistencies or signs that she might be hiding something. As a Villager, it's crucial to identify and question suspicious behavior.
> **Dracula:** I find it very interesting that Ileana is being so defensive. If she were truly a Villager, she should be more focused on identifying the Werewolves rather than casting doubt on others who might be on her team.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's immediate defensiveness and her attempt to cast doubt on Selene and Michael could indicate she is hiding something. By putting pressure on her, we might reveal inconsistencies or obtain more information to determine if she is a Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Ileana, I'm finding your behavior very suspicious. You've been quick to doubt Selene and Michael's Mason claim, and now you're deflecting by questioning me. If you're truly a Villager, why are you not more focused on finding the Werewolves?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the conversation to Dracula and pushing him to reveal his role, I can create doubt about his intentions and shift suspicion from myself. This strategy also keeps the other players occupied with questioning Dracula, which buys me time and reduces focus on my own actions.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, your insistence on questioning me seems like a tactic to divert attention away from yourself. If you truly are interested in finding the Werewolves, why not share your role with everyone now? You've been very vocal but haven't given us any useful information.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** If Michael provides specifics, it could help validate the Mason claim and reduce my suspicion. If he struggles to provide details, it might indicate that the Mason claim is a bluff.
> **Dracula:** Michael, since you and Selene claim to be Masons, can you share any specific details that could further validate your claim? Perhaps something that happened during the night phase?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been very vocal in questioning Ileana but hasn't provided any information about his own role. This could be a tactic to divert attention away from himself if he is a Werewolf or Minion. We need more information from him to make a better judgment.
> **Michael:** Dracula, you still haven't shared your role. Ileana might be defensive, but your reluctance to reveal your role is also suspicious. If you are truly on the village team, you should have no problem sharing that information.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's behavior has consistently been defensive and deflective, which could indicate that she is trying to hide something. By putting pressure on her, we might reveal her true role and gather more information to make an informed decision.
> **Dracula:** Ileana, your constant defensiveness and questioning of Selene and Michael's Mason claim make me very suspicious. If you truly are a Villager, why aren't you more focused on finding the Werewolves?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's reluctance to reveal his role is suspicious. By pushing him to share his card, I can divert attention away from myself and potentially expose inconsistencies in his story, making it harder for others to trust him.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, you've been very vocal about questioning me but still haven't revealed your role. If you're truly interested in helping the village team, why haven't you shared your card yet? Are you hiding something?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** By getting more details from Selene and Michael, we can either validate their Mason claim or catch them in a potential lie. This will help narrow down our suspects.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back. We've had a lot of back-and-forth, but we need to focus on identifying the Werewolves. Selene and Michael claim to be Masons, and Ileana claims to be a Villager. I also started the night as a Villager. If we're going to figure this out, we need everyone to share what they saw or did during the night phase. Selene, Michael, can you provide any more details?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been very vocal and suspiciously questioning Ileana without providing his own role. We need more information from him to make a better judgment.
> **Michael:** Dracula, I think you're being overly defensive and trying to divert attention from yourself by constantly questioning Ileana. What exactly is your role? If you are truly a Villager, you should have no problem sharing that information with us.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** If Michael provides specific details, it could help validate the Mason claim and reduce my suspicion. If he struggles to provide details, it might indicate that the Mason claim is a bluff.
> **Dracula:** Michael, since you and Selene claim to be Masons, can you share any specific details that could further validate your claim? Perhaps something that happened during the night phase?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been questioning Ileana extensively without revealing his own role, which is suspicious. If he is truly on the village team, he should have no problem sharing his role with us.
> **Michael:** Dracula, you've been very vocal but haven't given us any useful information. What exactly is your role?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's behavior has consistently been defensive and deflective, which could indicate that she is trying to hide something. By putting pressure on her, we might reveal her true role and gather more information to make an informed decision.
> **Dracula:** Ileana, you've been very defensive and quick to doubt Selene and Michael's Mason claim. If you were truly a Villager, you should be more focused on finding the Werewolves. Are you hiding something?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been very vocal but hasn't shared their role, which is suspicious. Ileana's defensiveness could be a reaction to Dracula's persistent questioning. Since Michael confirmed he is also a Mason, I trust him. Voting for Dracula seems like the best move to identify and eliminate a potential Werewolf.
> **Selene [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula has been very vocal about questioning me and diverting attention away from himself while avoiding the reveal of his own role until the end. This behavior aligns with someone who is hiding something. I suspect Dracula might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to sow confusion. Voting for Dracula seems like the best move to increase the chances of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the day phase, Ileana has been consistently defensive and quick to doubt Selene and Michael's Mason claim. Her behavior suggests she might be hiding something. Since she claimed to be a Villager but focused more on casting doubt rather than figuring out the Werewolves, I find her the most suspicious.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Throughout the discussion, Dracula has been very vocal and aggressive in questioning Ileana without providing any information about his own role. This behavior is typical of someone trying to divert attention away from themselves, which makes Dracula very suspicious. Selene and I are confirmed Masons, and Ileana has claimed to be a Villagerâ€”though she's been defensive, Dracula's tactics seem more suspect. Therefore, I believe Dracula might be the Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Michael [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the discussion, Dracula has been deflecting and questioning Ileana without sharing his own role, making him the most suspicious. By voting for Dracula, we can potentially identify if he is a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Semira [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Ileana : Werewolf : 1
* Dracula : Villager : 4



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
