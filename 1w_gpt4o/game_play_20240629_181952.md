## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Mircea. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Radu. They are thinking about their action.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards gives me a broader view of the possible roles in the game. Since three cards are in the center, knowing two of them will help narrow down the possibilities and assist in identifying any false claims made by other players during the Day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** By identifying who claims to have special roles, we can start to piece together the puzzle and see if anyone's stories don't match up. This will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** I think we need to hear from everyone who has a special role last night. This will help us piece together who might be lying. Who here claims to be the Seer, Mason, or Minion?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Knowing who the Seer is can help us gather accurate information and potentially catch any Werewolves trying to deceive us. It's a good starting point to untangle the web of roles.
> **Cristina:** I think it's crucial we identify who the Seer is. They can provide us with vital information about the center cards or another player's role. So, let's start with this: who here claims to be the Seer?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Knowing if the Masons saw each other helps us confirm the roles that are in play and identify potential lies. If we have clear information from the Masons, it reduces the uncertainty and helps us focus on finding the Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Alright, let's not waste time. I think we should hear from the Masons first. Did both Masons see each other last night? If not, we might have one in the center.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** This will help us verify if Cristina's claim is genuine or if she's trying to deceive us.
> **Radu:** Alright, I'll start. I looked at two of the center cards last night, and I saw both Masons there. So, Cristina, if you're really the Seer, what did you see?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's claim about seeing both Masons in the center is crucial. If he's telling the truth, it significantly narrows down the possible roles of other players. But if he's lying, it suggests he might be a Werewolf trying to deceive us. We need to get more clarity on this to identify the Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Radu, I'm curious about your claim. If you saw both Masons in the center, that means we don't have any active Masons among us. But if you're not telling the truth, we might have a Werewolf here trying to mislead us.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to verify if anyone falsely claims Mason. Since I know the Masons are not active, any claim would be a lie and a potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Radu:** Semira, you wanted to hear from the Masons first. Since I saw both Masons in the center, it makes sense to hear if anyone is claiming the Mason role. So, Semira, what's your role?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's claim is suspicious because he left out important details. By questioning him directly, we might uncover inconsistencies in his story or pressure him into revealing more information that could expose him as a Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Radu, I'm finding your claim hard to believe. If you saw both Masons in the center, why didn't you mention what the third center card was? That seems like crucial information if you're really the Seer.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Cristina is questioning my claim, it's important to verify her role. If she's the real Seer, she should have specific information about last night. If she hesitates or gives conflicting information, it might indicate she's lying.
> **Radu:** Cristina, you're really pushing me hard on my claim about the Masons being in the center. If you were the Seer, you should have some information too. So, what exactly did you see last night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's claim has a critical gap. If he was truly the Seer, he would have provided more complete information about the center cards. This makes me suspicious of his role and suggests he might be lying to cover up being a Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Radu, I'm not sure I trust your claim about seeing both Masons in the center. If you were truly the Seer, why didn't you mention what the third center card was? That seems like crucial information.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Cristina keeps challenging my claim and hasn't provided any information about her own Seer abilities, it's crucial to press her for specific details. This will help us determine if she's lying and potentially a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Radu:** Alright, let's cut to the chase. Cristina, you keep questioning my claim as the Seer without providing any concrete information yourself. If you're really the Seer, you'd have something to share. What exactly did you see last night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's claim is suspicious because he didn't mention the third center card. A real Seer would be more detailed, and his vagueness makes me think he's trying to hide something, possibly being a Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Radu, you've been dodging specifics and your story has gaps. If you were truly the Seer, you'd give us all the information, not just parts of it. So, I'm accusing you of being a Werewolf. Can you explain why you only mentioned the Masons and nothing about the third center card?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's evasiveness and her continuous questioning of my claim without providing any concrete information herself is highly suspicious. As the Seer, pressing her for specific details will either force her to reveal useful information or expose her as a liar, potentially a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Radu:** Here's the thing: I'm sticking to my claim. I saw both Masons in the center, so anyone claiming to be a Mason is lying. Cristina, you've been dodging and deflecting a lot. I'm starting to think you're trying to sow confusion. If you're really the Seer, you'd have given us more concrete info by now. So I'll ask again, what did you see?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's claim about seeing both Masons in the center but failing to mention the third center card is highly suspicious. A real Seer would provide more complete information. His reluctance to share details makes me think he's attempting to deceive us and hide his true role as a Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Radu, your story has too many gaps and lacks crucial details. I don't trust your claim about being the Seer. I think you're trying to cover up for being a Werewolf.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira has been deflecting and hasn't provided any information about her role. If she is a Werewolf or on the Werewolf team, she might hesitate or give conflicting information. This will help us identify potential lies.
> **Radu:** Semira, I'm still waiting for you to tell us your role. You've been pretty quiet and quick to cast doubt on my claim without revealing anything about yourself. It's time to step up and tell us what you know.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** If Radu were truly the Seer, he would have mentioned all the details, including the third center card. By pressing him on this omission, we might catch him in a lie if he's actually a Werewolf trying to deceive us.
> **Semira:** Radu, your claim about seeing both Masons in the center seems suspicious to me. You never mentioned the third card, which is crucial if you were truly the Seer.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** It's important to hear from everyone, especially those who haven't spoken much. This will help us gather more information and identify any inconsistencies.
> **Radu:** Mircea, you've been awfully quiet during this discussion. We need everyone to share what they know. What role did you have last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Radu's claim is partially detailed but missing critical information, which makes me cautious about his role. Cristina's persistent questioning without offering details feels like she's trying to deflect suspicion, which is suspicious in and of itself. This will help me gauge Cristina's response and create confusion among the players.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, let's try to piece this together. Radu, your claim of seeing both Masons in the center is indeed interesting, but it raises a lot of questions. If you truly were the Seer, you should have seen another card as well. I'm inclined to believe that we might have a Minion or Werewolf among us trying to create confusion. Cristina, since you haven't given us concrete information on what you saw, I'm starting to suspect you. Your persistent questioning without providing details feels like a deflection tactic. Could you please clarify exactly what you saw last night?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's sudden shift from being quiet to accusing me without providing any information about his own role is suspicious. We need to hear from everyone to piece together the true roles and identify the Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Mircea, your silence during the discussion and then suddenly casting doubt on me is quite suspicious. You haven't provided any concrete information about your role or what you saw last night. What exactly did you see or do during the night phase?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Cristina's persistent questioning without offering details feels like a deflection tactic. By pressing her to provide specific information, I can gauge her response and potentially cast more suspicion on her, deflecting it from myself.
> **Mircea:** Cristina, I find your behavior quite suspicious. You've been aggressively questioning others without providing any solid information yourself. Radu's claim, while incomplete, at least gives us something to work with. You, on the other hand, have not shared what you saw last night. What exactly did you see or do during the night phase?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's sudden accusation without any prior input makes him very suspicious. We need to clarify his role and actions to see if he is trying to mislead us as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Cristina:** Mircea, your sudden shift from being quiet to accusing me without providing any information about your role is highly suspicious. You've been dodging this entire time, and now you want to cast doubt on me? What exactly did you see or do during the night phase?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's claim of seeing both Masons in the center without mentioning the third card is suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, he'd have all the information. Cristina and Semira's consistent questioning of Radu makes me think they're trying to uncover the truth, while Radu's evasiveness suggests he might be a Werewolf.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's claim of seeing both Masons in the center but failing to mention the third center card is highly suspicious. A real Seer would provide more complete information. His reluctance to share details makes me think he's attempting to deceive us and hide his true role as a Werewolf.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's claim about seeing both Masons in the center is suspicious because he failed to mention the third card, which is crucial information for a true Seer. Additionally, Cristina's claim that she saw two center cards and did not reveal any specific player roles further supports the inconsistency in Radu's story. Therefore, I believe Radu is likely a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Semira [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina has consistently deflected questions and has not provided any concrete information about what she saw as the Seer, which makes her claim highly suspicious. My own observation of the two Masons in the center supports that anyone claiming to be a Mason is lying. Her behavior suggests she might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to sow confusion.
> **Radu [Seer]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Cristina's persistent questioning without offering any details herself feels like a deflection tactic. She has been trying to cast doubt on others while not providing any concrete information about her own role or actions during the night phase. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates she might be trying to cover her tracks as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Mircea [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Cristina.


The votes were:
* Cristina : Villager : 2
* Radu : Seer : 3



>***GAME:*** Radu was killed. The werewolves win.
