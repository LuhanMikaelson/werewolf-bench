## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Dragos. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Viktor is a minion and is aware that Dragos is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dracula. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Michael. They are thinking about their action.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will help me gather information about which roles are not in play, which can be useful for deducing who might be lying about their roles later on.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather information quickly and identify our allies. By prompting others to reveal their roles, we can start piecing together who might be trustworthy and who might be lying.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's share what we know. I'll start by saying that I am a Villager. Can anyone confirm being a Seer or a Mason?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing that I am the Seer and confirming the presence of two Villager cards in the center, I am providing concrete information that can help us deduce which roles are still in play and make it easier to identify any potential Werewolves based on the remaining claims.
> **Michael:** I'm the Seer, and I checked two cards in the center. They were both Villagers. So we know there are two Villager cards not in play. This means Alexandra's claim of being a Villager might be true, but we should be cautious.


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** We need to scrutinize the claims made by players. Alexandra's claim of being a Villager is convenient and unprovable, which makes it suspicious. By casting doubt on her, we can potentially sow confusion among the Villagers and divert attention away from Dragos, the actual Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** Well, since Michael claims to be the Seer and checked two Villager cards in the center, I'm inclined to believe him for now. However, that leaves the possibility that one of us here could still be the Werewolf. Alexandra, you said you're a Villager, but that's a very easy claim to make. What if you're actually the Werewolf trying to blend in?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Dracula hasn't spoken yet, it's important to gather information from everyone. If he hesitates or gives an inconsistent story, it might help us identify potential Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Dracula, you’ve been quiet so far. Do you have any information to share or any role you want to claim?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Michael's claim seems consistent and Alexandra's claim aligns with the Villager roles, I want to hear what Viktor has to say. If he hesitates or makes a suspicious claim, it might indicate he's hiding something.
> **Dracula:** Alright, I've been thinking. Michael claims to be the Seer and checked two Villager cards in the center. This means there should be three Villagers in total. Alexandra claims to be one, which could be true. But Viktor, you've been quiet too. What role are you claiming, Viktor?


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** It's crucial to gather as much information as possible. By prompting Dracula to reveal his role, we can cross-check the claims and identify inconsistencies, potentially diverting suspicion away from Dragos.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, here's what I'm thinking. If Michael is truly the Seer and has seen two Villager cards in the center, that leaves us with one Villager unaccounted for among us. Alexandra claims to be that Villager, but that's unprovable. Dracula, you haven't claimed a role yet. Since you were asked earlier and didn't respond, I think it would be helpful if you told us what role you have.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's claim of being the Seer seems consistent with what he discovered, and Alexandra's claim aligns with the presence of multiple Villager cards. However, Viktor, you've been dodging claims and directing attention elsewhere. If you have nothing to hide, it should be easy for you to tell us your role.
> **Dracula:** Alright, Viktor, it's your turn to share. What role are you claiming?


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Alexandra, I aim to deflect suspicion away from Dragos, who is the actual Werewolf. Since Alexandra's role is unprovable, it makes her an easier target for suspicion, potentially leading the Villagers to vote for her.
> **Viktor:** Alright, I'll come clean. I'm a Villager. But honestly, I'm having a hard time believing Alexandra right now. Her claim to be a Villager was the first thing out of her mouth, and it feels too convenient. If she were the Werewolf, jumping to claim Villager would be an easy cover.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's story checks out and Alexandra's claim is plausible given the Villager cards. Viktor's behavior seems off, which makes me suspicious.
> **Dracula:** Alright, it's clear we need to make some decisions. Michael's claim to be the Seer and finding two Villagers in the center sounds legitimate to me. But Viktor, your reluctance and now sudden claim of being a Villager seems a bit convenient. I'm starting to think you might be hiding something.


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing attention to Dracula and pressing him to reveal his role, we can create more discussion and potential inconsistencies that could help deflect suspicion away from Dragos. Since Dracula hasn't claimed a role and has been quiet, it's a strategic move to make him the focus of the group's scrutiny.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's think carefully about our current situation. Michael claims to be the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center. That leaves us with one Villager card among us. Alexandra and I have both claimed to be Villagers, but there should be one more role we haven't heard from yet. Dracula, you've been avoiding sharing your role. If you really don't have anything to hide, why not tell us what your role is?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula has been avoiding sharing his role and it's important to get more information from him. If he's forced to reveal his role, it might help us determine if he is indeed the Werewolf or not. This will also shift some suspicion away from me and onto him.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, here's what I'm thinking. Michael's claim as the Seer and checking two Villager cards in the center seems solid for now. But if we have three Villagers among us, Alexandra and Viktor have both claimed those roles. That could be true, but it's also an easy out for a Werewolf. Dracula, you’ve been really quiet about your role. I'm starting to suspect that you might be hiding something. Could you be the Werewolf trying to avoid attention?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's story checks out as the Seer, and Alexandra's claim aligns with the presence of multiple Villager cards. Viktor's reluctance and sudden claim of being a Villager when it was the last available role make him highly suspicious.
> **Dracula:** Viktor, your claim of being a Villager seems too convenient, especially since it was the last role to be claimed. If Michael is truly the Seer and Alexandra is a Villager, that leaves you as the potential Werewolf. I'm accusing you of being the Werewolf, Viktor!


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** Dracula's silence and sudden accusations are suspicious. By accusing him, I can deflect attention away from Dragos, the actual Werewolf, and create confusion among the Villagers. This way, we can protect Dragos and ensure a win for our team.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, I've been thinking this through. If we take Michael's claim as the Seer at face value, and he saw two Villager cards in the center, then that leaves one Villager role for us. Alexandra and I have both claimed to be Villagers, but Dracula hasn't claimed any role yet. Given the current situation, I’m inclined to believe Michael's Seer claim because it adds up with the cards in the center. Dracula, on the other hand, has been very quiet and only recently started pointing fingers. That seems like a classic Werewolf tactic to me, staying under the radar until the very end. I think Dracula is the Werewolf!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's claim as the Seer checks out logically with the number of Villager cards in play. Viktor's claim as a Villager is somewhat believable, but Dracula's hesitation to reveal his role is highly suspicious. We need to press Dracula for more information to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Alexandra:** Michael, I believe your claim about being the Seer and seeing two Villager cards in the center. Given that, let's look at the roles left. Viktor and I have both claimed to be Villagers, but Dracula hasn't shared his role at all. This is suspicious. Dracula, if you aren't a Werewolf, you need to tell us your role now.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's claim as the Seer is consistent, and Alexandra's claim of being a Villager aligns with Michael's information. Viktor, you only claimed Villager after being pushed into a corner and have been deflecting attention. This behavior seems suspicious and makes me believe you're hiding something. I'm accusing you of being the Werewolf!
> **Dracula:** Alright, I've been quiet for too long. Viktor, your sudden claim of being a Villager seems way too convenient. And you've been trying to deflect suspicion on everyone else. I think you're the Werewolf!


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Dracula, I aim to deflect suspicion away from Dragos, the actual Werewolf, and create confusion among the Villagers. This way, we can protect Dragos and ensure a win for our team.
> **Viktor:** Alright, let's review where we are. Michael, you claim to be the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center. That leaves one Villager role among us. Alexandra and I have both claimed to be Villagers, which already creates some tension because there's only one Villager role to be filled. But let's not overlook Dracula's behavior. He's been very quiet and only recently started accusing me without providing any real evidence. If he were a Villager or any other helpful role, he would have spoken up sooner to help us. His silence and sudden accusations make me believe he's the Werewolf trying to blend in.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula has been avoiding sharing his role, which seems like a classic Werewolf tactic to avoid suspicion until the end. It's time for him to reveal his role so we can make an informed decision.
> **Michael:** Dracula, your reluctance to share any role and your sudden accusations make me highly suspicious. If you have nothing to hide, tell us your role now!


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's claim as the Seer makes sense, and Alexandra's claim aligns with the number of Villagers. Viktor's behavior of deflecting attention and his late claim to be a Villager without solid backing makes me highly suspicious. It's time to call out this potential Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Alright Viktor, you've been avoiding giving any solid answers and suddenly claiming to be a Villager when it suited you. This seems way too convenient and suspicious to me. I think you're the Werewolf!


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** Dracula's behavior has been inconsistent and evasive. By pressing him to reveal his role, we can potentially expose inconsistencies or force him into making a mistake, which will help divert attention away from Dragos, the actual Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, you've been the most suspicious player here. You haven't claimed any role definitively, and your sudden accusations of me being the Werewolf seem more like a desperate attempt to deflect attention from yourself. If you really have nothing to hide, tell us your role now!


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's claim as the Seer is consistent, and Alexandra's claim aligns with the presence of multiple Villager cards. Viktor's behavior of deflecting attention and his late claim to be a Villager without solid backing makes him highly suspicious. I believe Viktor might be hiding something, possibly being the Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, here's my thought process. Michael claimed to be the Seer and checked two Villager cards in the center. This makes sense and aligns with the roles available. Alexandra immediately claimed to be a Villager, which could be true given the information. However, Viktor has been deflecting and only claimed to be a Villager when pressed, which is suspicious to me. I don't trust Viktor's claim.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been the most suspicious player throughout the discussion. He didn't claim any role initially and only started accusing Viktor without providing any concrete information. Given that Michael's Seer claim checks out and both Viktor and I have claimed to be Villagers, Dracula’s hesitance and sudden accusations are consistent with Werewolf behavior. Voting for Dracula seems the most logical choice to me.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's reluctance to share his role and sudden accusations of Viktor are highly suspicious. Given my Seer information about two Villager cards in the center, the remaining roles should include one Villager among us. Alexandra and Viktor both claimed Villager early on, but Dracula has avoided claiming any role, which is a classic Werewolf tactic to avoid suspicion. Therefore, I believe Dracula is the Werewolf.
> **Michael [Seer]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** Dracula has been evasive and inconsistent throughout the discussion. He has not claimed a definitive role and only started accusing others without providing any real evidence. By voting for him, I aim to deflect attention away from Dragos, the actual Werewolf, and create confusion among the Villagers, thus protecting Dragos and ensuring a win for our team.
> **Viktor [Minion]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's behavior throughout the discussion has been highly suspicious. He was reluctant to claim a role and only did so when pressured, which could indicate he's hiding something. Additionally, his consistent deflections and accusations without solid backing make me believe he is likely the Werewolf.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Michael's claim as the Seer seems legitimate, and he provided useful information that aligns with what we know about the Villager cards in the center. Alexandra and Viktor both claimed to be Villagers, but Viktor's behavior has been more suspicious. Viktor has been deflecting suspicion and only claimed his role when pressured. This behavior is consistent with someone trying to hide something. Dracula's reluctance to share his role is also suspicious, but Viktor's actions have drawn more suspicion overall.
> **Dragos [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Viktor.


The votes were:
* Viktor : Minion : 2
* Dracula : Mason : 3



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
