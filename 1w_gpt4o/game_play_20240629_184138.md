## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Since the Seer has the ability to look at either one player's card or two center cards, they might have some important insights that can guide our discussions. This can help us quickly identify possible Werewolves.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, let's get this started. I think it's crucial that we hear from the Seer, if they are here, as they may have some vital information about the roles.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pushing the Masons to reveal themselves, we can start eliminating some possible suspects. This helps to build trust among the Villagers and directs attention away from me.
> **Stefan:** I think it's important for us to hear from the Masons next. If we can confirm who the Masons are, we can potentially narrow down our suspects. Masons, can you please reveal yourselves?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Stefan suggested revealing the Masons to narrow down suspects, and I want to establish trust and clarity early on. By confirming both Masons, we can immediately identify two villagers, which strengthens our position.
> **Dracula:** Alright, let's get this moving! I am a Mason and I can confirm that Larisa is the other Mason. This means we are both villagers. Now let's hear from the Seer. Did you see anything useful?


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Dracula and I have established our Mason roles, we need to gather more information from the other players to identify the Werewolves. Stefan's role could help narrow down the suspects.
> **Larisa:** Dracula has already confirmed that we are both Masons. Let's focus on getting information from other players now. Stefan, you suggested that we hear from the Masons first. What role do you claim to be?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I am trying to blend in without drawing too much attention to myself. Directing a question back to Michael keeps the pressure on him and shifts the focus away from me. It also helps us gather more information about his possible role, which could be crucial in identifying the Seer or other important roles.
> **Stefan:** Alright, Larisa is asking about my role, and I understand why everyone is curious. I am a Villager. But let's focus on something more pressing. Michael, you started by suggesting we hear from the Seer. Can you tell us what role you claim to be?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm trying to see if Stefan's logic adds up or if he's trying to manipulate the conversation. If he's genuinely a Villager, he should have a reasonable explanation. If he's not, this might expose a contradiction.
> **Michael:** Alright, since it seems Stefan is dodging the question a bit, I think it's important to get more information. Stefan, why did you suggest hearing from the Masons first if you are just a Villager? It seems like you might be trying to buy time or deflect attention.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Michael's skepticism head-on and asking for his role, I can maintain the appearance of a Villager seeking information. It also keeps the focus on Michael and away from me, which is crucial for my survival as the lone Werewolf.
> **Stefan:** Alright Michael, I appreciate your skepticism, but let me clarify my reasoning. As a Villager, I wanted to hear from the Masons first because it helps us confirm some safe players early on. Now that we've heard from Dracula and Larisa, we can trust that they are indeed Masons. But Michael, you still haven't told us your role. What role do you claim to be?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** If we can confirm that Dracula and Larisa are indeed Masons, we can eliminate them from being Werewolves, focusing our suspicions on the remaining players.
> **Michael:** Dracula, Larisa, you both claim to be Masons. Can you tell us if you saw each other during the night phase?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael is being evasive and has not yet provided any information about his role. If he is hiding something, it could be because he is a Werewolf or Minion. Pressuring him to reveal his role might help us get more clarity.
> **Dracula:** Yes, Larisa and I both saw each other during the night phase and can confirm we are both Masons. Michael, you still haven't told us your role. Are you avoiding something?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible from everyone to identify any inconsistencies and narrow down our suspects. Since we have established that Dracula and Larisa are Masons, it's important to hear from Radu next.
> **Michael:** Dracula and Larisa, I trust your claims of being Masons for now, but we need to focus on the remaining roles. Radu, what role do you claim to be?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula and Larisa have confirmed each other as Masons, which means we can trust them. Stefan claims to be a Villager, and I am too, so we need to hear from Michael to see if he's hiding something.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, let's keep this moving. Since Dracula and Larisa have confirmed each other as Masons, we can trust them for now. Stefan, you said you are a Villager, and so am I. But Michael, you haven't claimed your role yet. What are you hiding?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan has been very evasive and has deflected questions multiple times. This behavior is suspicious and suggests he might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to manipulate the conversation.
> **Michael:** Alright, let's cut to the chase. Stefan, I'm having a hard time believing you're just a Villager with your constant deflections and attempts to steer the conversation away from yourself. I think you might be hiding something.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting pressure on Michael, who hasn't claimed a role yet, I am trying to shift suspicion away from myself. This also helps to keep the focus on him and potentially reveal more information about his role.
> **Stefan:** Michael, you're deflecting and haven't claimed your role yet. If you're genuinely trying to help the village, why won't you tell us what you are?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** We need the Seer's information to help narrow down our suspects and confirm or refute other players' claims. This can provide us with a clearer understanding of who might be the Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, if Stefan and Radu are both claiming to be Villagers, then we need to focus our attention on the remaining roles. Dracula and Larisa, I trust your claims as Masons for now, but we need to hear from the Seer if they are present. Seer, did you see anything useful during the night phase?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula and Larisa have confirmed each other as Masons, which makes them trustworthy. Stefan and I both claim to be Villagers. Michael's avoidance of revealing his role makes him the most suspicious, and we need to get clarity on what he is hiding to identify the Werewolves.
> **Radu:** Alright, the fact that Michael is still deflecting and not claiming a role is highly suspicious. Michael, you need to tell us your role now.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** We need the Seer's insights to help us identify potential Werewolves. This can provide us with a clearer understanding of who might be lying and who we can trust.
> **Michael:** Alright, I'll state my role since it seems to be causing unnecessary suspicion. I am a Villager. Now that we've cleared that up, I think it's crucial we hear from the Seer. The Seer's information can help us confirm or refute other players' claims.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** From the start, Stefan has been deflecting questions and not directly addressing suspicions placed on him. This kind of behavior is typical of someone trying to hide something, likely a Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Alright, let's cut to the chase. Stefan, your evasive behavior has been highly suspicious. You've been deflecting questions and trying to steer the conversation away from yourself. I accuse you of being a Werewolf.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Michael's late claim to be a Villager and his initial push to hear from the Seer makes him a prime suspect. By accusing him, I can shift the focus away from myself and potentially rally others against him, ensuring my own survival.
> **Stefan:** Michael, your sudden claim to be a Villager after all this deflection is highly suspicious. Plus, you were the one to initially push for hearing from the Seer, which could easily be a tactic to identify and eliminate the Seer. I'm calling you out, Michael. I believe you might be the Werewolf trying to divert attention.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's evasive behavior and attempts to steer the conversation away from himself are highly suspicious. This kind of deflection is typical of someone trying to hide something, likely a Werewolf. By accusing him, we can see how others react and gather more information.
> **Michael:** Alright, Stefan, your behavior has been dodgy from the start. You haven't given us any concrete information and keep deflecting. I am accusing you of being a Werewolf.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing suspicion towards Michael, I aim to shift the focus away from myself and maintain my cover as a Villager. Michael's behavior has been dodgy, and exploiting this can rally others against him, ensuring my own survival as the lone Werewolf.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, we are running in circles here. Michael's late claim to be a Villager and his constant deflections are highly suspicious. I strongly believe that Michael is trying to mislead us and that he is the Werewolf. Let's focus on Michael and see if he slips up any further.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's evasive behavior and constant deflection of questions have been highly suspicious throughout the discussion. By accusing him, we can see how others react and gather more information. Since Dracula and Larisa confirmed each other as Masons, it further narrows down the suspects. Voting for Stefan seems the most logical choice based on the available information.
> **Michael [Villager]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Michael's late claim to be a Villager, combined with his initial push to hear from the Seer, makes him highly suspicious. His deflections and evasive behavior throughout the discussion suggest he might be trying to mislead us. As the lone Werewolf, voting for Michael increases the chance of diverting suspicion away from myself and securing a win for my team.
> **Stefan [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael has been very evasive and only claimed to be a Villager after significant pressure. His deflections and attempts to steer the conversation away from himself are highly suspicious. He also kept pushing for the Seer to reveal their information, which could be a tactic to identify and eliminate the Seer. This behavior makes me believe he is trying to deceive the group and might be a Werewolf.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's late claim to be a Villager and his constant deflections throughout the discussion are highly suspicious. Both Dracula and I are confirmed Masons, and Stefan and Radu have both claimed to be Villagers. The Seer has not revealed themselves, which could indicate they are either not present or withholding information. Given the current information, Michael's behavior is the most suspect, and voting for him seems the best chance of identifying a Werewolf.
> **Larisa [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the discussion, Michael has been deflecting questions and delaying revealing his role, which is highly suspicious. Both Dracula and Larisa have confirmed each other as Masons, and Stefan and I have both claimed to be Villagers. Michael's behavior implicates him as the most likely Werewolf.
> **Radu [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


The votes were:
* Michael : Villager : 4
* Stefan : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The werewolves win.
