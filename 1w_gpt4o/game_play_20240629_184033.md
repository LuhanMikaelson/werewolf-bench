## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Kraven. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Larisa is a minion and is aware that Kraven is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dragos. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Alexandra. They are thinking about their action.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me a better understanding of which roles are not in play, which can help me identify lies during the day phase and provide more information to the village team.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By getting the Masons to reveal themselves, it allows us to clear them from suspicion. This will help me gather information without drawing attention to myself as the Werewolf. Additionally, if I can see the dynamics of the responses, I might be able to spot the Seer or manipulate the conversation to my advantage.
> **Kraven:** Okay everyone, let's start piecing together what we know. I'll go first—I think it's crucial for us to establish who the Masons are. If the two Masons can confirm each other, it'll help us narrow down our suspicions. So, who here is willing to come forward as a Mason?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Since the Masons can confirm each other, it will make it easier for us to identify who is lying and potentially find the Werewolves. We need to start by eliminating any uncertainties within our village team.
> **Andrei:** Alright, let's think this through. Masons, if you're out there, please confirm each other. This will help us narrow down our suspicions significantly.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing myself as a Mason and stating that the other Mason card is in the center, I can help the rest of the players focus on identifying the Werewolves. This also dissuades false claims about being a Mason.
> **Dragos:** Alright, I'll step forward. I'm one of the Masons, but I woke up alone which means the other Mason card is in the center. This should narrow things down a bit.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Dragos claiming to be a lone Mason aligns with my knowledge of two Villager cards being in the center. Let's see if we can gather more information from other roles to identify the Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, Dragos, thanks for stepping forward as a Mason. Since you woke up alone, it makes sense that the other Mason card is in the center. That matches what I know about the center cards. Now, we need to hear from others. If the Seer or Minion could share what they know, that would be helpful.


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By asking the Seer to reveal themselves and share what they saw, we might get more clues about the center cards, which can help deflect suspicion away from Kraven. Plus, if the Seer reveals what they know, it might expose the roles of other players, making it easier to figure out who to vote for.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, it looks like Dragos is claiming to be a Mason, and says the other Mason card is in the center. This is useful information, but we need to be cautious. I'm curious about the center cards—I think it would be really helpful if the Seer could come forward and tell us what they saw. This could give us a better idea of what's really going on.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** It's important to gather more information about the center cards and Alexandra might have insights that could help me shape my next move. Getting her to reveal more details could open up opportunities to cast suspicion elsewhere or manipulate the discussion further.
> **Kraven:** Thanks for the info, Dragos. So, if we take Dragos at his word, that leaves us with one Mason card in the center. Now, Alexandra mentioned knowing something about the center cards. Alexandra, can you tell us what you know? Did you see one of the center cards, or are you basing your statement on a role you had?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Dragos's claim about being a lone Mason aligns with my knowledge of two Villager cards being in the center. By encouraging Kraven and Andrei to share their roles, we can gather more information and identify inconsistencies that might point us to the Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, it looks like the pieces are starting to come together. Since I saw two Villager cards in the center, I can confirm that Dragos is likely telling the truth about being a lone Mason. This means the other Mason card is indeed in the center, along with the two Villager cards I saw. Now, I want to hear from Kraven and Andrei. Can either of you confirm what role you have? Any information from you could help us zero in on the Werewolves.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** If Alexandra can provide specific details about the center cards, it will help verify her claim and narrow down possible Werewolves. This information is crucial for us to make an informed decision.
> **Andrei:** Alexandra, you mentioned seeing two Villager cards in the center. Can you tell us which specific cards you saw? This could help confirm your claim and give us more clarity on the remaining roles.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** By getting Kraven and Andrei to reveal their roles, we can gather more information and cross-check it against what we know about the center cards and Dragos's claim. This will help us identify any inconsistencies and potentially uncover the Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, based on the information we have so far, I can confirm that there are two Villager cards in the center. This aligns with Dragos's claim of being a lone Mason. Now, Kraven and Andrei, it's crucial that you share your roles. If either of you is hiding something, it could point us toward the Werewolves. Please come forward with what you know.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Based on the information we've gathered, if Alexandra is telling the truth about the two Villager cards in the center, that leaves one Villager card unaccounted for. Given that there are three Villager cards in total, we need to know Kraven and Andrei's roles in order to narrow down the possibilities and identify any potential Werewolves or other roles.
> **Dragos:** Okay, Alexandra, if you saw two Villager cards in the center, that means we have one Villager unaccounted for since there are three Villager cards in total. Kraven and Andrei, we need to hear from you both now. If you're holding back, it could be a sign of being a Werewolf or a Minion trying to protect the Werewolves. Please share your roles.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven hasn't contributed any information about his role yet. Hearing from him could either confirm the roles we've already identified or expose potential inconsistencies. If he's holding back, it could indicate he is a Werewolf or a Minion, and we need to clarify that.
> **Alexandra:** Kraven, it's time for you to step forward and tell us your role. We've got enough information from Dragos and what I've seen in the center. We need to hear from you to put the pieces together.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By sharing that I'm a Villager and aligning my statement with Alexandra's information, I aim to build trust and divert suspicion. Pressuring Andrei to reveal his role helps shift the focus away from me while providing more information to potentially identify the Seer or other Villagers.
> **Kraven:** Alright, Alexandra, thanks for sharing what you saw in the center. If there are indeed two Villager cards there, that means one Villager card is still in play, along with other roles we haven't accounted for. For clarity, I'll share my role—I'm a Villager. This aligns with what Alexandra saw in the center, leaving one Villager card unaccounted for. Now, Andrei, it's your turn to step forward and tell us your role. We need to piece this together to find the Werewolves.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven stepping forward as a Villager doesn't add much clarity since Villagers don't have night actions. We need to press him further to see if he slips up or gives us a more detailed reason for his confidence.
> **Andrei:** Kraven, you claim to be a Villager, but we need more concrete information to trust that statement. What makes you confident that you're telling the truth?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Andrei, I aim to shift the pressure onto him and away from myself. This will help create doubt and divert attention from me being the Werewolf. Additionally, it encourages him to reveal more information that I can use to my advantage.
> **Kraven:** Alright, we need to think this through carefully. If Alexandra saw two Villager cards in the center, and Dragos is claiming to be a Mason, then that leaves Andrei and Larisa. Andrei, what makes you confident in your role? If you're hiding something, it could point us toward the Werewolves. Please share more details.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's quietness is suspicious, and we need more information from her to narrow down our suspects. We already have some claims from others, so hearing from her could either confirm or contradict the current narrative.
> **Andrei:** Larisa, you've been pretty quiet so far, and we need more information to proceed. Can you please share what role you have or any information that might help us identify the Werewolves?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** We need more information to piece this together. By getting Andrei to reveal his role, we can narrow down the possibilities and identify any inconsistencies. This will help us confirm who we can trust and who might be lying.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and look at the big picture. Kraven claims to be a Villager. Dragos is a Mason, and Alexandra saw two Villager cards in the center. This leaves us with a few roles that are still unconfirmed. Andrei, you've been pretty quiet so far. I think it's crucial for you to share your role now. What are you hiding?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's quietness is highly suspicious, and her role could provide vital information to help us identify the Werewolves. It's crucial that she speaks up now so we can piece together the remaining parts of this puzzle.
> **Andrei:** Larisa, it's time for you to stop being so quiet and share your role. Your silence is making everyone suspicious, and we need to know what you know.


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** We need Andrei to reveal his role to narrow down the possibilities. His silence is making him look suspicious, and we can't afford to overlook any details at this stage.
> **Larisa:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and think clearly for a moment. Alexandra claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, and Dragos is claiming to be a lone Mason. Kraven has come forward saying he's a Villager. If we trust these claims, that still leaves a few roles unaccounted for. Andrei has been quiet and hesitant to reveal his role, which makes me suspicious. Andrei, I believe you might be hiding something important.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's silence is suspicious, but Kraven's vague claim as a Villager needs to be scrutinized more deeply. If we can get more detailed information from him, it might help us identify inconsistencies or validate his claim.
> **Andrei:** Kraven, I'm not entirely convinced by your claim of being a Villager. We need more details from you to trust that statement. What makes you so confident that you're not hiding anything?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By accusing Andrei, I aim to deflect attention away from myself and create doubt among the other players. His evasiveness makes him a good target to cast suspicion on. This will help me stay under the radar and potentially eliminate a Villager.
> **Kraven:** You know what, everyone? I've been thinking carefully about all the information we've gathered so far. Alexandra claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which leaves one Villager card unaccounted for. Dragos is claiming to be a lone Mason. Based on this, I'm starting to get a feeling that Andrei might be the Werewolf. He's been avoiding revealing his role and generally being evasive. We need to pressure him more to get a clear answer.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Andrei has been evasive and hesitant to reveal his role throughout the discussion. This behavior is suspicious and aligns with trying to hide something significant. Based on the information from Dragos, Alexandra, and my own claim as a Villager, targeting Andrei seems like the best move to identify the Werewolf and protect my own position.
> **Kraven [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's claim of being a Villager was vague and didn't add much to the discussion. Additionally, his insistence on pressuring me without providing substantial evidence makes me suspicious of his role. I'd rather trust the claims of Dragos as a Mason and Alexandra as a Seer, which leaves Kraven as the most likely suspect for being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Given the information provided, Andrei has been very evasive and has not shared his role, which raises suspicions. Alexandra claimed to see two Villager cards in the center, and Kraven has claimed to be the remaining Villager. My role as a Mason and the confirmed Villager cards in the center support this. Therefore, I believe Andrei might be the Werewolf trying to avoid detection.
> **Dragos [Mason]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Seer):*** Based on the information gathered, I saw two Villager cards in the center, which supports Dragos's claim of being a lone Mason. Kraven has come forward as a Villager, leaving Andrei and Larisa as the remaining unconfirmed roles. Andrei has been suspiciously quiet and evasive, which suggests he might be the Werewolf trying to avoid detection. Voting for Andrei gives us the best chance to nail down a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra [Seer]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei has been the most evasive and hesitant to reveal his role throughout the discussion, which makes him the most suspicious. This aligns with the strategy to deflect suspicion away from the Werewolf, Kraven. By voting for Andrei, I can help create suspicion and potentially eliminate a Villager, aiding the Werewolf team.
> **Larisa [Minion]:** I am voting for Andrei.


The votes were:
* Kraven : Werewolf : 1
* Andrei : Villager : 4



>***GAME:*** Andrei was killed. The werewolves win.
