## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Semira. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Alexia is a minion and is aware that Semira is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Cristina. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Andrei. They are thinking about their action.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can potentially identify roles that are not in play, which will help us narrow down the possibilities for the roles that the other players might have. This will provide more information to the village team and reduce the chances of false claims.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By initiating the conversation and claiming to be a Villager, I hope to steer the dialogue and see how others react. Specifically calling out Vladimir can force him to make a claim, which might give me more information on his role.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's start by sharing our roles or at least hinting at them. Being open might help us catch the Werewolves more easily. I'll start: I'm a Villager. What about you, Vladimir?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to start the discussion and get everyone to reveal their roles or at least hint at them. This will help us gather information and identify inconsistencies in the claims.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, since Semira claims to be a Villager, I'll also claim my role. I'm a Villager as well. But we need to be careful, as Werewolves might try to blend in by claiming to be Villagers too. Let's hear from others.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Both Semira and I have claimed to be Villagers. It's crucial to hear Andrei's claim to compare it with others and identify any inconsistencies in the roles. The more information we have, the easier it will be to figure out who the Werewolves are.
> **Vladimir:** Andrei, what role are you claiming? We need to gather more information to catch the Werewolves.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** I checked the center cards during the night phase, and both were Villagers. This directly contradicts the claims made by Semira and Vladimir, suggesting that they might be trying to mislead us.
> **Andrei:** Guys, I know for a fact that two Villager cards are in the center. This means that Semira and Vladimir cannot both be Villagers. One or both of them might be lying.


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei's claim seems to be a strategic move to cast doubt on Semira and Vladimir. By questioning him, I can divert attention and potentially flush out more information from the other players.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, I'm going to be upfront here. I think we have a liar among us. Andrei just claimed that he knows for a fact that two Villager cards are in the center, which means either Semira or Vladimir – or both – are lying about being Villagers. But here's the thing: If Andrei was truly the Seer, wouldn't he have mentioned looking at the center cards earlier? This sudden info drop makes me suspicious. Andrei, what role are you really playing?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** By directing a question at Alexia, I can gather more information on her role and see if she aligns with the villager team or if she is trying to mislead us. This will also buy me some time to assess other players' reactions and get a clearer picture of who might be lying.
> **Andrei:** Alexia, I'm surprised you think my claim is sudden. Being the Seer, I wanted to gather initial claims before revealing critical information. Knowing there are two Villagers in the center directly contradicts both Semira and Vladimir's claims. What role are you claiming, Alexia?


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Andrei's claim directly, I aim to divert attention and create doubt about his role. This will help protect Semira, the known Werewolf, and potentially flush out more information from the other players.
> **Alexia:** Alright, let's address the elephant in the room. Andrei claims to be the Seer and says he saw two Villager cards in the center. If that's true, then either Semira or Vladimir – or both – are lying about being Villagers. However, this could also be a tactic by Andrei to stir confusion and deflect suspicion from himself. If he was really the Seer, why did it take him so long to reveal such a crucial piece of information? It sounds more like a convenient story to me.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** By directing a question at Vladimir, I can force him to address my Seer claim directly. This will help us gather more information and see if he can provide a convincing reason for his Villager claim. It will also allow me to gauge his reaction and see if he's trying to deflect suspicion or provide valuable insights.
> **Andrei:** Vladimir, you haven't really addressed my claim directly. What do you think about my assertion that there are two Villagers in the center? If my claim is true, it means either you or Semira are lying. Can you explain why we should believe your Villager claim?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to hear from everyone to piece together who's telling the truth. Cristina's silence so far is suspicious and could indicate she's hiding something. Let's see what she claims.
> **Vladimir:** Cristina, you've been awfully quiet. What role are you claiming?


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. Andrei's late reveal as Seer and his specific claim seems like a diversion tactic. It's important to question the timing and motive behind Andrei's claim, which could indicate he is a Werewolf or Minion trying to create confusion.
> **Cristina:** I'm finding the situation quite suspicious. Andrei's sudden claim about being the Seer and seeing two Villagers in the center seems a bit too convenient, especially when both Semira and Vladimir claimed to be Villagers early on. If Andrei genuinely saw the Villager cards in the center, he would have spoken up sooner. I think Andrei could be trying to deflect suspicion.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. Andrei's late reveal seems like a tactic to deflect suspicion away from himself, which is something a Werewolf or Minion might do. It's important to question the timing and motive behind Andrei's claim.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, I'm finding your sudden claim about being the Seer and seeing two Villagers in the center to be quite suspicious. If you were truly the Seer, why didn't you reveal this crucial information right away?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Addressing Cristina directly will force her to reveal her role, which will help clarify her position and potentially expose inconsistencies. It will also buy time to analyze reactions and gather more information from other players.
> **Andrei:** Cristina, I understand your suspicion, but as the Seer, I waited to gather initial claims before revealing my information to see if anyone would contradict themselves. Now that I have, it's clear there are conflicting claims. If there are truly two Villagers in the center, either Semira or Vladimir, or both, are lying. What role are you claiming, Cristina?


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to probe Vladimir to see if he can provide more context or slip up in his defense. This will help to clarify the situation and determine who is more likely to be lying between Andrei and Vladimir.
> **Cristina:** Vladimir, Andrei's claim puts you in a tricky spot. If Andrei is right, either you or Semira is lying about being a Villager. And if Andrei is lying, he could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to create chaos. What do you think about Andrei's sudden reveal and his accusation?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's sudden reveal about being the Seer and seeing two Villagers in the center is suspicious. If he was truly the Seer, he should have mentioned this earlier. By questioning him directly, I aim to uncover inconsistencies in his story and gather more information to identify the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Andrei, your claim about being the Seer and seeing two Villager cards in the center is a big deal. If you're telling the truth, it means either Semira or I am lying, and I know I'm not. But Cristina raised a good point: Why did it take you so long to reveal this if it was crucial information? Semira and I claimed to be Villagers right away. Something isn't adding up here, Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** It's crucial to hear Semira's response directly to understand her reasoning and see if she can provide a convincing argument. This will help us determine if she's suspicious or genuinely a Villager.
> **Andrei:** Semira, given that I know two Villagers are in the center, why should we believe your claim over Vladimir's? One of you has to be lying.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Andrei's timing and credibility, I can cast doubt on his claim and shift suspicion away from me. This also aligns with the strategy of making others more uncertain about who to trust.
> **Semira:** Andrei, your sudden claim about being the Seer and seeing two Villagers in the center seems very convenient. If you were truly the Seer, wouldn't you have revealed such a crucial piece of information right away rather than waiting? Why should we believe you now?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Addressing Cristina directly will force her to reveal her role, which will help clarify her position and potentially expose inconsistencies. It will also buy time to analyze reactions and gather more information from other players.
> **Andrei:** Cristina, I understand your skepticism, but as the Seer, I revealed my information after hearing initial claims to see who might be lying. Given the current situation, it's crucial for us to hear your role claim. If you are on the village team, this will help us narrow down the suspects. What role are you claiming?


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. Andrei's late reveal about seeing two Villagers in the center doesn't add up and seems like a tactic to confuse us. Given the conflicting claims, Andrei's behavior is the most suspicious, and calling him out will help us narrow down the real roles.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, your claim of being the Seer and seeing two Villagers in the center is highly suspicious to me. If you were truly the Seer, you should have revealed this crucial information early on, especially when both Semira and Vladimir claimed to be Villagers right away. Waiting this long makes it seem like you're trying to deflect suspicion from yourself. I think you're either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to create chaos.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's consistent deflection and accusation towards me without revealing her own role is highly suspicious. By pushing her to reveal her role, we might expose her as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei:** Cristina, your reluctance to reveal your role is quite evasive. If you were truly on the village team, you wouldn't hesitate to clear things up. I think you're hiding something.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. Andrei's behavior and timing are highly suspicious. His late reveal seems like a strategy to deflect suspicion away from himself, which is something a Werewolf or Minion would do.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, I've been thinking about this a lot. Andrei's sudden claim about being the Seer and seeing two Villagers in the center just doesn't sit right with me. If he was genuinely the Seer, he should have revealed such crucial information immediately, especially when we had claims from Semira and Vladimir early on. This delay feels like a tactic to confuse us. I think Andrei is either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to create chaos.

>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Andrei's sudden claim about being the Seer and seeing two Villagers in the center seems very suspicious to me.

His inconsistent behavior makes me believe he is either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to create chaos.
> **Semira [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's sudden claim of being the Seer and seeing two Villagers in the center is highly suspicious.

> **Vladimir [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei's sudden claim of being the Seer and seeing two Villager cards in the center seems suspicious.

> **Alexia [Minion]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's claim to be the Seer and seeing two Villagers in the center came too late and seems like a tactic to create confusion. Given the conflicting claims and his behavior, it's highly likely that he is either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to deflect suspicion.
> **Cristina [Mason]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's consistent deflection and refusal to reveal her role make her highly suspicious. If she were truly on the village team, she would have been more straightforward about her role. Her reluctance to provide clear information suggests she might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to create chaos and deflect suspicion from herself.
