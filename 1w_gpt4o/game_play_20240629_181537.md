## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Larisa. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Marius is a minion and is aware that Larisa is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Kraven. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Stefan. They are thinking about their action.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather information about roles that are not in play. This will help narrow down the possibilities and better inform my decisions during the day phase. Additionally, if I discover that a Werewolf or Minion is in the center, it can significantly help the village team by reducing the number of potential threats.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know that the other Mason card is in the center. By encouraging those with special roles, like the Seer, to speak up, we can gather more information to help identify the Werewolf. This will help us quickly pinpoint any suspicious behavior or claims.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, I think it's important we start by hearing from anyone who might have special information, like the Seer. Has anyone here seen anything that could help us identify a Werewolf?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the roles I saw in the center, I can help the village team understand which roles are definitely not in play. This will help us eliminate false claims and focus on finding the Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** I think it's worth mentioning that I saw two of the center cards and one of them was a Villager and the other was a Mason. This means there's one less Villager and one less Mason in play for sure. This information can help us narrow down the roles.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Stefan's early reveal of information, I can subtly cast doubt on his intentions without directly accusing him. This might make others suspicious of him, which aligns with my goal of protecting the Werewolf and avoiding suspicion on myself or Larisa.
> **Marius:** I find it interesting that Stefan is claiming to have seen the center cards and that one of them is a Villager and the other is a Mason. If that's true, then we have fewer Villagers and Masons in play, which could make identifying the Werewolf easier. But why would Stefan share this information so early? Maybe he's trying to gain our trust. We should keep that in mind.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm trying to understand Stefan's motive for revealing information so early. It could be a tactic to gain trust, which makes me suspicious of him.
> **Mircea:** Stefan, I find your claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center a bit convenient. Why would you share this information so early? It feels like you might be trying to gain our trust. Can you explain why you chose to reveal this now?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's skepticism could be a tactic to deflect suspicion. By questioning his role directly, we might uncover valuable information or catch him in a lie.
> **Stefan:** Mircea, you seem quite skeptical of my claim. If you're not the Seer, what role do you have that makes you question my information?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** If Stefan really is the Seer, his explanation for why he chose to look at the center cards could help clarify his intentions and validate his claim. If he's lying, his reasoning might become inconsistent.
> **Mircea:** Stefan, your early reveal does indeed seem convenient. It's possible you're trying to gain our trust, or you might actually be the Seer. But I'm curious, if you are the Seer, why did you choose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's skepticism and attempts to cast doubt on my claim make me suspicious of him. By directly questioning his role, I aim to put him on the spot and see if he provides any contradictory or revealing information. This can help the village team narrow down potential threats.
> **Stefan:** Mircea, you've been very vocal about my early reveal, which makes me wonder about your role. Are you perhaps trying to sow doubt to protect yourself or a fellow Werewolf? What role are you claiming?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to see if Marius has any additional information or if he might be hiding something. His thoughts on Stefan were insightful, so understanding his role could help us narrow down the suspects.
> **Mircea:** Marius, you've mentioned that Stefan's early reveal is interesting and could be a tactic to gain trust. What role are you claiming, and do you have any information that can help clarify the situation?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Stefan's decision to look at the center cards, I can cast doubt on his intentions and potentially make others suspicious of him. This aligns with my goal of protecting Larisa and avoiding suspicion on myself. The more confusion I create, the better it is for my team.
> **Marius:** Stefan, your early reveal about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center is quite convenient, as Mircea pointed out. If you're really the Seer, then you're helping us. But if not, I can't help but wonder if you're trying to steer us away from the truth. Can you provide more details about why you chose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card? Are you trying to hide something?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's constant questioning of my role and early reveal makes me suspicious of him. If he provides a role, it might give us more context and help identify inconsistencies or potential lies.
> **Stefan:** Alright, it seems like Mircea is very skeptical about my claim and keeps questioning my motives. Mircea, what role are you claiming? If you're not the Seer, then what makes you so suspicious of my information?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's deflection and lack of clear reasoning make me suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, looking at another player's card would provide more targeted information. His actions seem more like those of a Werewolf trying to gain trust.
> **Mircea:** Stefan, you keep deflecting and questioning others instead of providing a clear reason why you chose to look at the center cards. Why not look at one of the player's cards if you were the Seer? I think you're trying to mislead us.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven has not contributed much to the conversation, which could be a tactic to stay under the radar. By questioning him directly, we can prompt him to reveal his role or provide any useful information he might have. This will help us gather more clues and potentially identify inconsistencies in his statements.
> **Stefan:** Kraven, you've been very quiet since the start and haven't really contributed to the discussion yet. What role are you claiming, and do you have any information that can help us identify the Werewolf?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** If Mircea is trying to sow doubt, it could be a tactic to divert attention. By questioning Mircea directly, we can gather more information about their intentions and role, which can help us determine if they are suspicious or not.
> **Kraven:** Mircea, you've been questioning Stefan a lot, but we haven't heard much about your own role. What role are you claiming, and do you have any information that can help us identify the Werewolf?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's silence is concerning, and it's important to hear from everyone to gather as much information as possible. His role and reasons for staying quiet could either clear him or raise more suspicions.
> **Mircea:** Kraven, you've been silent for most of the discussion. I find that quite suspicious. What role are you claiming, and why haven't you contributed more to the conversation?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea's persistent skepticism and questioning of Stefan could be a tactic to sow doubt and confusion, which is often a strategy used by Werewolves. By pressing Mircea for their role and any information they might have, we can gain more clarity and potentially reveal any inconsistencies in their claims.
> **Kraven:** Mircea, you've been questioning Stefan a lot, and it's making me wonder if you're trying to divert attention from yourself. What role are you claiming, and do you have any information that can help us identify the Werewolf?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's constant deflection and lack of clear reasoning make me suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, looking at another player's card would provide more targeted information. His actions seem more like those of a Werewolf trying to gain trust.
> **Mircea:** Stefan, you've been very defensive ever since you made your claim about the center cards. If you're really the Seer, you should be willing to explain your reasoning clearly. Why did you choose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius's persistent questioning of my claims without providing any information of his own makes me suspicious. By directly asking him to reveal his role, we might uncover inconsistencies or get valuable information that can help us identify the Werewolf.
> **Stefan:** Marius, you've been consistently questioning my motives but haven't shared much about your own role. If you're truly trying to help the village, what role are you claiming and do you have any information that can help us identify the Werewolf?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Kraven has been silent, which might make others suspicious of him. By directing attention to him, I aim to divert suspicion away from myself and Larisa. This also helps me gather more information and potentially identify other Villagers or special roles.
> **Marius:** Kraven, you've been very quiet and haven't really contributed much to our discussion. I find that a bit suspicious. Can you tell us what role you're claiming and if you have any information that can help us identify the Werewolf?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Stefan's early claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center could be a tactic to gain our trust. By accusing Stefan directly, we can see how he responds and possibly reveal any inconsistencies in his story.
> **Kraven:** Stefan, I'm starting to think you might be a Werewolf. Your early reveal about the center cards is just too convenient.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius's persistent questioning without providing his own role makes me suspicious. By pressing him to reveal his role, we might catch inconsistencies or get valuable information to help identify the Werewolf.
> **Stefan:** Marius, you've been questioning my motives quite a bit, but haven't given us much information about your own role. What role are you claiming, and why are you so focused on me?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea's persistent skepticism and questioning of Stefan seemed to be a tactic to divert attention. Given that Stefan's claim about the center cards aligns with what I know about the Mason card being in the center, it makes Mircea's behavior more suspicious. Voting for Mircea seems like the best move to identify a potential Werewolf.
> **Kraven [Mason]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea has been consistently questioning my motives without providing any useful information about his own role. Additionally, his persistent skepticism towards my Seer claim seems like an attempt to sow doubt and divert attention. This makes me suspect he might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to manipulate the village.
> **Stefan [Seer]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Stefan's early reveal about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center was very convenient and drew suspicion from multiple players. His defensive reactions and lack of clear reasoning for his actions make him a likely target to cast doubt on. By voting for Stefan, I aim to protect Larisa and steer suspicion away from myself.
> **Marius [Minion]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's claim about seeing the center cards early on seems convenient and could be a tactic to gain trust. His deflection and inability to provide a clear reason for looking at the center cards make me suspicious that he might be a Werewolf.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea has been overly skeptical and aggressive towards Stefan, who claimed to have seen the center cards. This behavior could be an attempt to divert attention from themselves, making them a suspicious candidate as a potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Mircea.


The votes were:
* Stefan : Seer : 2
* Mircea : Villager : 3



>***GAME:*** Mircea was killed. The werewolves win.
