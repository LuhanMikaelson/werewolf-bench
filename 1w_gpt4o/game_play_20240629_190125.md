## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexia. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Lucian and Semira. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Vladimir. They are thinking about their action.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Since there are three cards in the center, looking at two of them will give me a better chance to deduce which roles might be in play. This can help me identify false claims and assist the village team in rooting out the Werewolves.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know Semira is on the village team. By questioning Vladimir, I aim to gather more information and potentially catch someone in a lie. This will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** I am confident that Semira is not a Werewolf since she is one of the Masons like me. We need to find out who the Werewolves are. Vladimir, what role did you have during the night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing the center cards I saw helps eliminate confusion and false claims, and it confirms that the Minion is not in play. This should help the Villagers focus on identifying the true Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** I took a look at two of the center cards last night. One of them was Minion and the other was Villager. Based on this information, we know that there is no Minion in play. This helps narrow down our search for the Werewolves.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian has claimed to be one of the Masons and has vouched for Semira. I have revealed valuable information about the Minion being in the center, which narrows down the possible roles in play. It’s important now to hear from the others, and Alexandra hasn't spoken yet. Her response could give us more clues to identify the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Alexandra, what role did you have during the night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** It seems a bit too convenient that Vladimir would know both the Minion and Villager are in the center without stating what the third center card is. This could mean he's trying to avoid giving out more information that could expose a lie.
> **Alexandra:** Vladimir, I'm a bit skeptical of your claim. If you saw the Minion and the Villager in the center, then that leaves us with one more card in the center that you didn't see. Why didn't you mention what that third card might be?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Hearing from Alexia will give us more information to work with and help us identify any inconsistencies in players' claims. My goal is to gather enough information to identify the Werewolves and ensure the village's victory.
> **Vladimir:** Alexandra, I didn't mention the third card because I didn't look at it. We only get to look at two cards as the Seer, and those were the ones I chose. Now, we need to figure out who among us might be the Werewolves. Alexia, you haven't spoken yet. What role did you have during the night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** We need to gather more information, and Alexandra's role is crucial to validate or challenge Vladimir's claim. If Alexandra can provide a solid role that fits with what has been said, we might start seeing the real picture.
> **Alexia:** Alright, everyone, let's piece this together. Lucian claims to be a Mason and says Semira is the other Mason. Vladimir claims to be the Seer and saw Minion and Villager in the center. Alexandra, you didn't clearly state your role, but you seem skeptical of Vladimir. From my perspective, if we trust Lucian's Mason claim, then the real question is whether we trust Vladimir's Seer claim. I believe Alexandra's skepticism of Vladimir is legitimate. If Vladimir is lying, he might have a hidden agenda. Alexandra, what role did you actually have during the night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's deflection of the question to me without revealing her own role is suspicious. If she were a Villager or another clear role, she'd likely state it to build trust. Her hesitation could imply she's hiding something, possibly being a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Alexia, I'm feeling increasingly suspicious of you. You tried to summarize the situation, but you conveniently didn't reveal your role. What role did you have during the night?

> **Alexandra:** Alexia, I'm feeling increasingly suspicious of you. You tried to summarize the situation, but you conveniently didn't reveal your role. What role did you have during the night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By accusing Alexandra directly, I divert attention away from myself and put pressure on her to defend herself. This tactic can create doubt among the other players about her role, making it less likely that they will focus on me.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, I think Alexandra's reluctance to share her role and her immediate suspicion of me is highly suspicious. Why would she deflect so quickly without providing her own role? This seems like classic Werewolf behavior, trying to cast suspicion on someone else before they get called out themselves. I think Alexandra might be the Werewolf here.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia has been very talkative and quick to summarize the situation without providing her own role. This could be a tactic to deflect suspicion away from herself. We need to get to the bottom of this and figure out if she has something to hide.
> **Semira:** Alexia, I'm not convinced by your summary and your quick deflection towards Alexandra. Why didn't you share your role? Are you hiding something?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting pressure on Alexandra to reveal her role, we can either confirm or challenge her claims. If she stumbles or hesitates, it might solidify suspicions about her being a Werewolf. This strategy helps divert suspicion away from me and keeps the focus on her.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, let's think this through logically. Lucian and Semira both claim to be Masons, which provides a solid basis for their roles if we trust them. Vladimir claims to be the Seer and saw Minion and Villager in the center, leaving one unknown card. Alexandra has yet to clearly state her role, which raises some eyebrows. As for me, I am a Villager. I know it's easy to point fingers, but Alexandra's immediate deflection and suspicion seem like a Werewolf tactic to shift focus. Alexandra, you need to clarify your role clearly.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's hesitation and repeated deflection without initially stating her role are suspicious. If she were truly a Villager, she would have been more upfront to build trust. Accusing her might pressure her into revealing more inconsistencies or the truth.
> **Alexandra:** Alexia, your explanation and hesitation don't add up. You avoided revealing your role initially and deflected suspicion onto me. This is classic Werewolf behavior to shift focus away from yourself. I think you're trying to manipulate us.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting pressure on Alexandra to reveal her role, we can either confirm or challenge her claims. If she stumbles or hesitates, it might solidify suspicions about her being a Werewolf. This strategy helps divert suspicion away from me and keeps the focus on her.
> **Alexia:** Alright, let's break this down logically. Lucian and Semira both claim to be Masons, which provides a solid basis for their roles if we trust them. Vladimir claims to be the Seer and saw Minion and Villager in the center, leaving one unknown card. Alexandra has yet to clearly state her role, which raises some eyebrows. As for me, I am a Villager. I know it's easy to point fingers, but Alexandra's immediate deflection and suspicion seem like a Werewolf tactic to shift focus. Alexandra, you need to clarify your role clearly.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian and Semira have established a solid claim as Masons. Vladimir's Seer claim is shaky because he didn't check the third card in the center. Alexia's deflection and hesitation are classic signs of a Werewolf trying to shift suspicion. Highlighting these inconsistencies will help us narrow down the real Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Lucian, you and Semira both claiming to be Masons gives us some trust there. Vladimir, if you claim to be the Seer and saw the Minion and Villager in the center, why didn't you check the third card? That could have given us a lot more information. Alexia, your deflection and hesitation make me really suspicious. If you were a Villager, you should have said so earlier. Right now, I think the Werewolves are trying to manipulate us by creating confusion. Let's focus on who seems the most inconsistent.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By summarizing the situation and emphasizing Alexandra's reluctance to reveal her role, I aim to cast doubt on her and divert suspicion away from myself. This approach aligns with the goal of hiding my identity as a Werewolf and focusing suspicion on a potential Villager.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and look at the overall situation. Lucian and Semira both claim to be Masons, and that's a strong duo if we trust them. Vladimir claims to be the Seer and saw Minion and Villager in the center, leaving one unknown card. Alexandra has yet to clearly state her role, which raises some eyebrows. I'm a Villager. If we analyze the claims, Alexandra's immediate deflection and suspicion towards me seem like a Werewolf tactic to shift focus. Alexandra, you need to clarify your role clearly.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know who my ally is (Semira), and Vladimir's claim as Seer seems consistent with the information about the center cards. Alexia's behavior is questionable, but your constant evasion stands out the most. If you're a Villager or another role, you need to come clean now, or I'm inclined to believe you're hiding something sinister.
> **Lucian:** Alexandra, your reluctance to reveal your role makes me very suspicious. You've been deflecting and avoiding straightforward answers. I think we need to focus on you as a potential Werewolf.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian and Semira have a credible claim as Masons. Vladimir's Seer claim is shaky due to not checking the third card. Alexia's behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of a Werewolf trying to shift focus.
> **Alexandra:** Lucian, you and Semira claiming to be Masons adds up and gives us a solid base to work from. Vladimir, your claim of being the Seer and seeing the Minion and Villager in the center is noted, but not looking at the third card leaves a gap. Alexia, your hesitation and repeated deflection make me believe you're hiding something. I think Alexia is trying to manipulate us. Let's focus on her.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra's reluctance to share her role and her repeated deflection of suspicion onto others is classic Werewolf behavior. We need to clarify her role to see if she's hiding something more.
> **Vladimir:** Alexandra, you've been deflecting and avoiding revealing your role throughout this discussion. This seems highly suspicious to me. We need to get to the bottom of this. What role did you have during the night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's behavior has been highly suspect throughout the discussion. She has been deflecting attention and was hesitant to reveal her role. This could be classic Werewolf tactics to avoid suspicion. We need to get a clear answer from her to determine if she's trying to manipulate us.
> **Alexandra:** Alexia, your hesitation to reveal your role initially and your constant deflections make you look very suspicious to me. Are you hiding something? Why should we trust you?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia's behavior has been highly suspicious throughout the game. She avoided revealing her role initially and repeatedly deflected suspicion onto others. This suggests she might be trying to manipulate us and hide her true identity. Given that I have confirmed Semira as a fellow Mason and Vladimir's Seer claim aligns with the information about the center cards, Alexia stands out as the most likely Werewolf.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra has been deflecting suspicion and avoiding revealing her role throughout the discussion. This behavior is classic Werewolf behavior, trying to shift focus away from herself. Given the information from Lucian and Semira claiming to be Masons, and my own Seer role confirming the Minion and Villager in the center, Alexandra's lack of transparency makes her the most suspicious candidate.
> **Vladimir [Seer]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's hesitation to reveal her role initially and her constant deflections make her look very suspicious. She may be trying to manipulate us, which is indicative of Werewolf behavior. Voting for her seems to be the best way to narrow down the true Werewolves.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia's hesitation to reveal her role and her constant deflections make her highly suspicious. She kept summarizing the situation without providing her own role, which is classic Werewolf behavior. Lucian and I both confirmed each other as Masons, and Vladimir's Seer claim seems consistent with the information he provided. Alexandra has been more skeptical but seems more genuine in her questioning. Therefore, I believe Alexia is the most likely Werewolf.
> **Semira [Mason]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Alexandra's reluctance to reveal her role and her immediate deflection towards me when questioned seem highly suspicious. Given that Lucian and Semira both claim to be Masons and Vladimir claims to be the Seer with plausible information, Alexandra's behavior fits the classic Werewolf tactic to shift focus. Voting for her aligns with the goal of casting doubt on a potential Villager and diverting suspicion away from myself as a Werewolf.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


The votes were:
* Alexandra : Villager : 2
* Alexia : Werewolf : 3
