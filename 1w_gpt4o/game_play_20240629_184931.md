## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Cristina. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Marius. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dragos. They are thinking about their action.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at Cristina's card, I can gather direct information about one of the other players, which might help us identify a potential Werewolf or Minion early on. This can be crucial information to share during the Day phase and can help us catch any false claims.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** I saw Cristina's card during the night and know she is a Werewolf. I want to see if she lies about her role or tries to deceive us with false information.
> **Dragos:** Cristina, what role do you claim to have?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to blend in and appear as a straightforward Villager without special abilities. By asking a general question about suspicious activity, I can gather more information about what other players might claim and look for contradictions.
> **Cristina:** I'm a Villager. I didn't have any special actions last night, but I do have a question for everyone: Has anyone seen anything suspicious or revealing during the night?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Cristina claimed to be a Villager, it might be valuable to press her on why no one has yet claimed to be the Seer. This could help us identify if someone is hiding their role or being deceptive.
> **Selene:** Cristina, why do you think no one has claimed to be the Seer yet? Do you think someone might be hiding an important role?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question back to Selene, I can gather more information about her and her role. It also keeps the focus off me and builds on the suspicion that someone might be hiding something important, which could help me identify potential threats.
> **Cristina:** Selene, that's a good point about the Seer. It's strange that no one has claimed to be the Seer yet. If someone is hiding an important role, it's either because they are trying to stay safe or they are up to something. Selene, do you have any idea who might be hiding something?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's evasiveness about the Seer and her immediate defensiveness make me suspect she might be trying to hide something. By pressing her on this point, we might be able to see if she slips up or reveals something more.
> **Selene:** Cristina, I find it curious that you immediately jumped to the question of who might be hiding an important role. While it's a valid concern, it could also be a diversion. Why do you think someone would want to stay safe if they have an important role?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question back to Selene, I can gather more information about her and potentially catch her in a lie or contradiction. It also helps to deflect suspicion away from myself and keep the focus on finding out who might be hiding an important role.
> **Cristina:** Selene, I appreciate your point, but I'm genuinely trying to understand the situation. If no one claimed to be the Seer, it might mean the Seer is trying to avoid being targeted. Since you seem to be questioning me a lot, what role did you have last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's evasive answers and lack of initiative in identifying other roles suggest she might be hiding something. Pressing her further might reveal inconsistencies or force her to slip up, which could help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Cristina, I find it interesting that you haven't made a strong case for anyone else's role yet. If you're really a Villager, wouldn't you be more curious about who the Werewolves might be? Can you tell us more about why you think no one has claimed the Seer role yet?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene has been questioning me repeatedly, which could be an attempt to deflect attention away from herself or her potential allies. By putting her on the spot and asking directly about her role, I can apply pressure and see if she slips up or contradicts herself. This also helps to keep the focus off of me.
> **Cristina:** Selene, I find it very interesting that you're so focused on me right now. It makes me wonder if you might be trying to deflect suspicion from yourself. Are you hiding something? What role did you have last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather more information from Dragos since he hasn't contributed much to the discussion yet. It's important to see if his response aligns with what we know or contradicts other claims.
> **Selene:** Dragos, you haven't said much yet. What role did you have last night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know Cristina is a Werewolf because I saw her card during the night. It's crucial to share this information with everyone to steer the discussion in the right direction and catch the Werewolves. Cristina's false claim of being a Villager is a clear indication that she's trying to deceive us.
> **Dragos:** I have some important information to share with everyone. Last night, I used my ability and found out that Cristina is actually a Werewolf. She just claimed to be a Villager, which means she's lying. We need to be cautious and consider this when deciding who to vote for.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dragos has accused me of being a Werewolf, but if I counter-accuse him, it may cast doubt on his claim and shift suspicion away from me. By questioning the timing and intent of his revelation, I can potentially undermine his credibility and create confusion among the other players.
> **Cristina:** Dragos, that's a bold accusation you're making against me. I'll be honest, I think you're trying to divert attention from yourself. If you really had important information, why didn't you share it earlier in the discussion? I'm starting to think you might actually be the Werewolf here, trying to throw us off track.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's persistent deflection and false claim of being a Villager are major red flags. By directing a question to Selene, who has been actively questioning Cristina, I can reinforce the idea of Cristina's deceitful behavior and gather more support to reveal the truth.
> **Dragos:** Selene, Cristina is trying very hard to deflect attention from herself and cast doubt on me. Since I know for certain that Cristina is a Werewolf, I find her accusations against me to be very suspicious. What do you think about Cristina's behavior so far?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Cristina and Dragos have both been very vocal, it's important to hear from the quieter players to see if their claims align or reveal inconsistencies. Marius's response could provide valuable insights or contradictions that help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Marius, you've been very quiet during this discussion. I think it's time for you to share what role you had last night and your thoughts on the current situation.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** It's crucial to scrutinize Dragos' claim to verify its authenticity. By pushing for more detail, we can either catch Dragos in a lie or confirm his information, which helps us identify the Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Dragos, your claim that Cristina is a Werewolf is very bold. But, if you really had such critical information, why didn't you share it earlier in the discussion? Also, if you were the Seer, you would have looked at one player's card or two center cards. Who was your target, and what did you see in the center cards?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius questioned why I didn't share my information earlier, and it's important to address that while also getting his role and thoughts on Cristina's deceit.
> **Dragos:** Marius, I understand your skepticism, but I need to clarify that I indeed used my ability to look at Cristina's card directly and found her to be a Werewolf. What role did you have last night, and how do you respond to the fact that Cristina claimed to be a Villager when I know she is not?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** By questioning Selene directly, I aim to shift the focus onto her and see if she stumbles or reveals something suspicious. This will help us verify her intentions and possibly catch her in a lie if she is indeed trying to deflect attention.
> **Marius:** Selene, I find it odd that you haven't been more direct with your own role. If you are truly on the Village team, why are you focusing so much on Cristina instead of revealing something useful about yourself?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius's comment about my lack of directness seems like a deflection. By pressing him on his role and thoughts on Dragos's claim, we might uncover more valuable information or catch him in an inconsistency.
> **Selene:** Marius, why do you think it's odd that I haven't revealed anything useful about myself yet? We're all trying to gather information, and it's important to hear from everyone before jumping to conclusions. What role did you have last night, and what do you think about Dragos's claim against Cristina?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** It's important to scrutinize Dragos' claim to verify its authenticity. By pushing for more detail and questioning the timing of his accusation, we can either catch Dragos in a lie or confirm his information, which helps us identify the Werewolves. As a Mason, exposing deceit is crucial to help the villagers.
> **Marius:** Dragos, you claim to have used your ability to look at Cristina's card and that she's a Werewolf. However, this seems very convenient for you to say now. If you were really the Seer, why didn't you share this information as soon as we started discussing? Cristina did claim to be a Villager, and if she was lying, you should have immediately pointed it out. I'm starting to think you might be the Minion trying to protect a real Werewolf. Can you explain why you waited so long to make this accusation?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius has been deflecting and questioning others without providing concrete information about his own role. By pressing him directly, I aim to gather more information and possibly reveal any inconsistencies in his behavior. This will also help in supporting my claim about Cristina being a Werewolf and identifying any other potential threats.
> **Dragos:** Marius, you've been deflecting questions back to others and not directly addressing my accusation against Cristina. If you're truly on the Village team, why haven't you been more forthcoming about your own role? What role did you have last night and what do you think about my claim that Cristina is a Werewolf?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know that the other Mason card is in the center, so I am trying to gather more information and see if Dragos' story holds up. If he is lying, it might indicate he is the Minion or a Werewolf trying to mislead us. Accusing him directly might prompt others to reveal more about their roles and help us identify the real Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Dragos, I find it too convenient that you waited until now to accuse Cristina of being a Werewolf. If you really were the Seer, you would have revealed such critical information immediately. This delay makes me suspicious of your true motives.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I saw Cristina's card during the night and confirmed that she is a Werewolf. Despite her claiming to be a Villager, her behavior and persistent deflection further support that she is trying to deceive us. Voting for Cristina is the best action to take to protect the village and eliminate a known threat.
> **Dragos [Seer]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos claimed to have used his ability and identified Cristina as a Werewolf. Cristina has been evasive and defensive throughout the discussion, which aligns with Dragos's accusation. Given the lack of concrete information from Marius and the need to act on the strongest lead, voting for Cristina seems to be the best course of action to potentially identify a Werewolf.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dragos's delayed accusation and insistence on targeting me without early disclosure seem suspicious. This could indicate he's the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf or is fabricating his Seer claim. Voting for Dragos increases the chance of him being a deceptive role.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos' late accusation against Cristina, despite being very bold, seemed too convenient and poorly timed. As the only known Mason, I believe he might be the Minion trying to protect a real Werewolf. His story doesn't add up, and voting him out seems to be the safest choice for the Village team.
> **Marius [Mason]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos claimed to be the Seer and accused Cristina of being a Werewolf. However, his timing for revealing this critical information was suspiciously late. It's possible he's the Minion trying to protect a real Werewolf, or he's simply lying. Voting for Dragos seems the most logical choice given the information.
> **Stefan [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


The votes were:
* Dragos : Seer : 3
* Cristina : Werewolf : 2



>***GAME:*** Dragos was killed. The werewolves win.
