## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Ileana. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Vladimir is a minion and is aware that Ileana is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Selene. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Andrei. They are thinking about their action.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about which roles are not in play. This will help narrow down the possibilities for the other players' roles and provide useful information for the village team during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By prompting the Seer to reveal themselves, I aim to identify who the Seer is, which could be valuable for the Werewolf team to later target. This also makes me appear helpful and cooperative to the Village team.
> **Ileana:** Wow, what a night! Okay, everyone, let's start piecing together the puzzle. I am just a simple Villager, but I think the Seer should come forward and share any useful information they might have gathered.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** I'm aiming to establish trust among the Villagers and identify who might be on the Village team. This will help me to direct suspicion away from Ileana and myself. By confirming Masons early, we can eliminate potential allies for the Villagers and focus suspicion elsewhere.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, let's get to the bottom of this. I think it's important to hear from the Masons early on. If they can confirm each other, it will narrow down our suspects significantly. So, can the Masons please reveal themselves?


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the center cards I saw, we can eliminate some possibilities and focus on identifying the Werewolves. This should help the village team by reducing the confusion and making it easier to determine who might be lying.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's get some clarity. I actually checked two of the center cards last night, and I saw that they were a Villager and a Mason. This means there's one less Villager and one less Mason in play, which could help narrow things down. So now I'd like to hear from the Masons or anyone who can confirm their role first.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** If Andrei's claim is true about the cards in the center, confirming the Masons will narrow down our suspects significantly. If the Masons can confirm each other, it will validate Andrei's claim and help us identify possible Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Andrei, this is very interesting. You claim to be the Seer and that you saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. This could be helpful, but I want to hear from the Masons now. Vladimir and Ileana, can either of you confirm being a Mason?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By pushing Dragos to claim a role, we can put him on the spot and gauge his reaction. This could help deflect attention away from Ileana and allow us to gather more information about the other players' roles. If Dragos stumbles or hesitates, it might cast suspicion on him, clearing the path to protect the Werewolf team.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, based on what Andrei said, if there’s a Villager and a Mason in the center, we know that there’s one less Villager and one less Mason in play. This means the Masons should definitely come forward to confirm each other. If no one steps up, we’ll know something fishy is going on. I feel like Dragos is being a bit too eager to shift the focus. Dragos, why haven't you claimed a role yet?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir is quick to accuse me of shifting focus, which seems suspicious. I want to know his role to see if his accusations hold any weight.
> **Dragos:** Vladimir, you're right, I haven't claimed my role yet. But before I do, I'd like to know why you seem so eager to point fingers at me just for trying to get some clarity. What role do you claim to be?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Dragos on the spot, I can deflect suspicion away from Ileana and sow doubt among the other players. If Dragos stumbles or gives an uncertain answer, it could lead others to suspect him instead.
> **Vladimir:** Dragos, you're being very cautious and that makes me suspicious. If you have nothing to hide, then tell us your role now. Why are you hesitating?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's quick finger-pointing and insistence on knowing my role without providing his own makes me suspicious. I want to see if he can provide a convincing role that aligns with the current information we have.
> **Dragos:** Vladimir, your eagerness to accuse me is really suspicious. You’ve been pushing me to reveal my role without offering much information about yourself. If you’re so sure about your claims, what exactly is your role?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Dragos to reveal his role, I can potentially divert suspicion away from Ileana and myself. If Dragos hesitates or fumbles, it could cast doubt on him, making it easier to protect the Werewolf team. Additionally, if Dragos reveals a role that contradicts the information we have, it could further confuse the Villagers and disrupt their deductions.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, let's think about this logically. Andrei has claimed to be the Seer and mentioned seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center. This means that there are fewer Villagers and Masons in play. Ileana has claimed to be a simple Villager, but we still need confirmation from the Masons. Dragos, you've been very hesitant to reveal your role, which is quite suspicious. If you're innocent and have nothing to hide, then why not tell us your role now?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir has been pushing me to reveal my role without offering his own. This behavior is highly suspect and could indicate he is trying to deflect attention away from himself. By pressing him to reveal his role, we might expose inconsistencies that could help us identify him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos:** Alright, Vladimir, I'll play along. I am a Villager, just like Ileana claims to be. However, your eagerness to accuse me without providing any information about your own role is very suspicious. Why haven't you told us your role yet?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Dragos on the spot again, I can increase the pressure on him and potentially expose inconsistencies in his story. This can divert suspicion away from Ileana and myself, while also creating doubt among the other players. If Dragos stumbles or gives an uncertain answer, it could lead others to suspect him instead, making it easier to protect the Werewolf team.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and consider the information we have. Andrei has claimed to be the Seer and mentioned seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center. This means we have fewer Villagers and Masons in play. Ileana claims to be a Villager, and Dragos also claims to be a Villager, but I'm not completely convinced by Dragos' response. It seems a bit too convenient that he's mirroring Ileana's claim without adding much to the conversation. We still need the Masons to come forward and confirm each other. If no one steps up soon, it will be clear that either Andrei or Dragos is lying. Dragos, your hesitation and mirrored claim make me suspicious. Why are you so quick to follow Ileana's lead without any new information?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's behavior is highly suspicious. He's been pushing for me to reveal my role without providing his own, which could be a tactic to deflect attention. By pressing him to reveal his role, we can expose any inconsistencies and potentially identify him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos:** Alright, enough with the back-and-forth accusations. Andrei, you claim to be the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. This means we have one less of each in play. Ileana and I are claiming Villager, which fits. But Vladimir, you're being evasive and overly aggressive. Why haven't you revealed your role yet?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Dragos, I aim to deflect suspicion away from Ileana and myself. Dragos' hesitant behavior is a perfect target to cast doubt on his identity, making it easier to protect the Werewolf team. If the Masons don't come forward, it will add more weight to my accusation, sowing confusion among the Villagers.
> **Vladimir:** Everyone, let's take a step back and analyze the situation closely. Andrei has claimed to be the Seer and mentioned seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center. This means we have fewer Villagers and Masons in play. Ileana and Dragos both claim to be Villagers. However, we still haven't heard from the Masons, and it's crucial for them to come forward to help narrow down our suspects. If they don't, it could mean something is off. Now, considering all options, I must say that Dragos’ behavior has been quite suspicious. His eagerness to follow Ileana's claim and his hesitation to reveal his role earlier make me suspect he could be hiding something. Maybe he's the Werewolf trying to blend in with the Villagers. What do you all think about this?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Based on Andrei's claim and my own knowledge as the only Mason, I can infer that the other Mason and one Villager are indeed in the center. This makes Ileana and Dragos' claims more plausible. Vladimir's evasion and suspicion-throwing without revealing his role makes him the most suspicious to me right now.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, I think it's time for me to jump in here. Andrei's claim about being the Seer and seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center aligns perfectly with what I've observed. The other Mason card is indeed in the center, which means I'm the only Mason in play. This also means Ileana and Dragos' Villager claims could be true. However, Vladimir, your behavior has been quite aggressive and accusatory without giving us any information about your role. It seems rather suspicious to me. Why are you acting this way?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to shift suspicion onto Vladimir, who has been quite accusatory. By questioning his role, I aim to deflect suspicion away from myself and cast doubt on his intentions, making him look more like a potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, let's take a closer look at the information we've gathered. Andrei claims to be the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. Selene has confirmed that she is a Mason, meaning the other Mason card is indeed in the center. Now, we have three Villager claims: myself, Dragos, and Vladimir. But Vladimir has been very aggressive in accusing others without stating his own role, which is suspicious. Vladimir, you're pointing fingers at Dragos without much basis. Why haven't you told us your role yet?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Dragos on the spot and questioning his behavior, I aim to divert suspicion away from Ileana and myself. If Dragos hesitates or gives an uncertain answer, it will cast doubt on his identity, making it easier to protect the Werewolf team. Additionally, focusing suspicion on Dragos may cause the other players to overlook my role as the Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and consider the facts carefully. Andrei claims to be the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. Selene has confirmed that she is a Mason, which means the other Mason is indeed in the center. Ileana and Dragos both claim to be Villagers. But here's the thing—Dragos has been very quick to mirror Ileana's claim without adding much to the conversation and has been overly defensive. This makes me strongly suspect that Dragos could be the Werewolf trying to blend in with the Villagers. We need to be cautious and think logically about this. Dragos, you need to explain yourself!


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's refusal to reveal his role while aggressively accusing others is highly suspicious. By pressing him to reveal his role, we might expose inconsistencies and potentially identify him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos:** Selene, your confirmation as a Mason is helpful and aligns with Andrei's claim. But Vladimir's behavior continues to be highly suspicious. Vladimir, why haven't you revealed your role yet? Your aggressive accusations without any defense seem like you're deflecting attention.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Dragos on the spot again and questioning his behavior, I can shift suspicion away from Ileana and myself. If Dragos hesitates or gives an uncertain answer, it will cast doubt on his identity, helping to protect the Werewolf team.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, let's piece this together logically. Andrei, you claim to be the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. Selene, you've confirmed that you're the only Mason. This lines up with Andrei's claim. But what's been bothering me is Dragos' behavior. He's been too eager to fit in and has mirrored Ileana’s Villager claim without adding anything substantial. This makes me highly suspicious that Dragos could actually be the Werewolf trying to blend in. Dragos, why are you so unconvincing? Are you hiding something?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's behavior continues to be highly suspicious. His aggressive accusations without any defense seem like he's deflecting attention. By pressing him to reveal his role, we might expose inconsistencies and identify him as a potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos:** Alright, everyone, let's take a moment to consider the information we have. Andrei claims to be the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. Selene has confirmed that she is the only Mason, which aligns with Andrei's claim. That leaves us with a few options to consider. Ileana and I both claim to be Villagers, but Vladimir's aggressive accusations without revealing his own role seem highly suspicious to me. We need to be logical about this. Vladimir, why haven't you revealed your role yet?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Selene's delay in revealing her role, I can cast doubt on her claim, sowing confusion among the Villagers. This will help deflect suspicion from Ileana and myself, and potentially stir up uncertainty about the validity of the Seer and Mason claims.
> **Vladimir:** Selene, you claim to be a Mason and confirmed one of the center cards as a Mason. But this makes me wonder why you didn’t come forward earlier when we were asking for Masons. Why did you wait so long to reveal your role?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Vladimir has been aggressive and accusatory without revealing his own role, which makes him look suspicious. By voting for him, I aim to deflect suspicion away from myself and cast doubt on his intentions. If others follow this logic, it could help the Werewolf team by potentially eliminating a Villager or causing confusion.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** Given that Ileana is the Werewolf and I am the Minion, my goal is to protect her and deflect suspicion away from us. Dragos has been hesitant and defensive, making him an easy target to focus the votes on. Additionally, Selene revealed herself as the Mason, aligning with Andrei's Seer claim. Voting for Dragos will help achieve confusion among the Villagers and protect the Werewolf team.
> **Vladimir [Minion]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Andrei (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir has been overly aggressive and accusatory without revealing his own role, which is suspicious behavior. Additionally, Selene has confirmed herself as the only Mason, and my Seer information aligns with that. Ileana and Dragos' Villager claims fit the information we have. Vladimir's hesitation and aggressive tactics suggest he might be hiding something, potentially as a Werewolf.
> **Andrei [Seer]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir has been overly aggressive in accusing me without providing his own role, which is highly suspicious. Andrei's claim as a Seer and Selene's confirmation as a Mason align well with the information we have. Ileana and I both claim to be Villagers, which leaves Vladimir's evasive behavior as the main point of suspicion. His actions suggest he could be trying to deflect attention away from himself as a potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Based on the information gathered during the day phase, Andrei claimed to be the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. This aligns with my knowledge as the only Mason in play, confirming that the other Mason card is indeed in the center. Ileana and Dragos both claimed to be Villagers, which fits with the remaining roles. Vladimir was very aggressive and accusatory without revealing his role, which seems suspicious and could indicate he is trying to deflect attention from himself. Therefore, I believe Vladimir is the most likely to be a Werewolf.
> **Selene [Mason]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


The votes were:
* Vladimir : Minion : 4
* Dragos : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Vladimir was killed. The werewolves win.
