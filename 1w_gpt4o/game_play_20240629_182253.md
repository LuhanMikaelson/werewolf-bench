The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the presence of two Villager cards in the center, I'm providing crucial information that reduces the number of Villager claims that can be made by others. This helps to narrow down suspicious claims and identify potential Werewolves or Minions among the players.
> **Dracula:** Hey everyone, I'm starting to form my suspicions. I looked at the center cards during the night, and I saw two Villager cards there. This means that we have fewer Villager roles in play among us, so we should be careful if anyone claims to be a Villager.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Since Dracula's claim reduces the possible Villager count among us, it's strategic to put pressure on players who haven’t spoken much yet to see if they slip up or reveal useful information.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, I want to point out something very crucial based on what Dracula just said. If there are two Villager cards in the center, that means we are left with only one Villager among us. We should be super suspicious of anyone claiming to be a Villager right now because there's a high chance that they're lying. Andrei, you’ve been rather quiet so far. What role are you claiming to be?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** If Lucian claims to be a Villager, we can examine his response carefully and see if it aligns with the information Dracula provided. Plus, as a fellow Mason, I can subtly gauge his reaction to determine if we can trust him or if he's hiding something.
> **Andrei:** Alright, let's get things started. Given what Dracula and Selene have pointed out, it's unlikely that we have more than one Villager among us. Lucian, since you haven't spoken up yet, what's your role?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Based on Dracula's claim and the limited number of Villager roles left, we need to carefully analyze anyone who might be misleading us. Selene has been vocal but hasn't claimed a role yet, so it's essential to know what she's playing as.
> **Lucian:** Alright, I think I've got something to say. Dracula, you mentioned seeing two Villager cards in the center. That implies there’s only one Villager among us. Given the roles we have and the probability, I feel like it’s crucial to scrutinize anyone claiming Villager right now. Selene, what role are you claiming?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to reduce suspicion on myself by claiming a critical role and shifting the focus to Andrei, who has been quiet. This will help me gather more information and potentially identify the Seer or Mason while protecting Alexandra, the Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Lucian, I hear you, and I think it's important we get as much information on the table as possible. Since Dracula has already given us some crucial information about the center cards, I'm going to reveal that I'm the Seer. I looked at two cards in the center and saw the Minion and a Mason card. This means that the Minion role is in the center, and we have only one Mason among us. Andrei, since you were asked earlier and haven't given a clear answer yet, could you please tell us what role you're claiming?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene’s hesitation and mirroring of Dracula’s info could indicate she’s fabricating her role. Confronting her directly might reveal inconsistencies in her story.
> **Andrei:** Selene, I find your claim very interesting. If you truly saw the Minion and a Mason in the center, why didn't you just reveal this from the start? Why did you wait to hear what Dracula said first?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to direct attention away from Alexandra since she's a Werewolf. However, by asking her to speak up now, it might make her seem more trustworthy if she gives a convincing answer, and the focus will remain on Andrei.
> **Selene:** Andrei, I understand why you might find my claim interesting, but I wanted to hear what Dracula had to say first to see if his information matched up with what I saw in the center. Now that we've got that out of the way, I think it's crucial we address the silence from Alexandra. Alexandra, you've been very quiet. Could you please tell us what role you're claiming?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pointing out the inconsistencies in the claims made by Dracula and Selene, I can cast doubt on their credibility. This will help me blend in as someone genuinely trying to solve the puzzle, while also diverting suspicion away from myself. By questioning Andrei, who has remained somewhat ambiguous, I can gather more information and potentially identify the Seer or other valuable roles to target during the vote.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, I’ve been listening carefully and I think we need to address the inconsistencies here. Dracula claimed to see two Villagers in the center, and Selene, you claimed to see the Minion and a Mason. But why are these two stories not matching up? There should be three center cards, and only two are mentioned so far. Andrei, what role did you see or what role do you claim? We need all the cards on the table to make sense of this.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly confronting Selene about the inconsistency in her story, I aim to put pressure on her and possibly expose any lies. If she is indeed lying, she might struggle to keep her story straight under scrutiny. Additionally, if we can confirm she's not the Seer, it would help narrow down our search for the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Selene, your story doesn't quite add up to me. You said you saw the Minion and a Mason in the center, but Dracula already claimed to see two Villagers there. This mismatch in information suggests to me that someone is lying. Given that you're the one who responded after Dracula, it seems like you might be trying to cover something up.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Andrei, I aim to shift the focus away from Alexandra, the actual Werewolf, and sow confusion among the villagers. Since both Dracula and I provided conflicting information about the center cards, accusing Andrei could create enough doubt and misdirection to protect Alexandra and ensure the Werewolf team’s victory.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, we need to address the inconsistencies here. Dracula claimed to see two Villagers in the center, and I claimed to see the Minion and a Mason. Someone is clearly lying. Given that Andrei hasn't given a clear role yet and seems to be deflecting suspicion, I'm starting to think Andrei might be hiding something. Andrei, I accuse you of being a Werewolf!


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula and Selene's stories are conflicting. If Andrei and I are both Masons, Selene must be lying about seeing a Mason card in the center. This makes me highly suspicious of Selene.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, listen up! We have a problem here. Dracula says there are two Villagers in the center, and Selene, you claim there's a Minion and a Mason. That means one of you is definitely lying. But wait, there's more. Andrei and I are the Masons, so the Mason card Selene mentioned cannot be in the center!


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** If Selene is lying about her Seer claim, it's likely she's trying to cover up being a Werewolf or the Minion. Her story doesn't align with the information we have, and it's time to put pressure on her.
> **Andrei:** Everyone, listen up! There's a huge inconsistency right now. Dracula claimed to see two Villager cards in the center, and Selene claimed to see the Minion and a Mason. But I know for a fact that Lucian and I are the Masons. This means Selene is lying about her claim!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pointing out the inconsistencies in Selene's claim and questioning her directly, I can cast doubt on her credibility. This helps divert suspicion away from myself while also gathering more information to use against the Villagers.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and analyze the situation. We've got three conflicting claims here: Dracula saw two Villagers in the center, Selene saw the Minion and a Mason in the center, and Lucian and Andrei both claim to be Masons. This means one of two things: either Dracula or Selene is lying, or we've got a more complex situation at hand. Given that Selene's claim directly conflicts with the Mason claims, I'm inclined to believe Dracula for now. Selene, how do you explain this discrepancy?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to press Andrei for confirmation. If he confirms seeing Lucian, that will help establish their credibility as Masons, making it easier to shift suspicion onto others who might be Villagers. Additionally, it helps create doubt about Dracula's claim since both cannot be true.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's take a deep breath and think logically. Dracula and I have conflicting claims about the center cards. Dracula says there are two Villagers there, and I claimed to see the Minion and a Mason. Now, Lucian and Andrei both claim to be Masons, which means my claim about the Mason card is conflicting, but let's consider this: If Andrei and Lucian are both Masons, then they should have seen each other during the night phase. Andrei, if you truly are a Mason, confirm it now.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's claim directly conflicts with the information we have. If she were truly the Seer, she would not have made a claim that contradicts the confirmed Mason roles. By putting pressure on Selene, we can potentially expose her as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's think this through. Dracula claimed to see two Villager cards in the center, and Selene claimed to see the Minion and a Mason. But Lucian and I are both Masons, which means Selene's claim doesn't add up. Given this inconsistency, I strongly believe Selene is lying to cover up something. We need to focus on her and consider that she might be a Werewolf or the Minion.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Given the conflicting information and the fact that we have two Masons who confirm each other's roles, it makes Selene's claim highly questionable. As the Seer, I know there are two Villagers in the center. Selene's conflicting claim needs to be addressed immediately.
> **Dracula:** Selene, your claim is highly suspicious to me. You said you saw a Minion and a Mason in the center, but we already have two players, Lucian and Andrei, both claiming to be Masons. This means your story doesn't add up, and I'm starting to think you might be a Werewolf trying to mislead us. Can you explain this discrepancy?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing suspicion towards Andrei, I aim to divert attention away from Alexandra, who is the actual Werewolf. This will sow confusion among the Villagers and help protect the Werewolf team. Also, if Andrei is seen as the most suspicious, it will reduce the credibility of his claim about being a Mason.
> **Selene:** Everyone, let's look at the facts here. We have three conflicting claims about the center cards: Dracula says he saw two Villagers, I said I saw the Minion and a Mason, and Andrei and Lucian both claim to be Masons. Given these inconsistencies, I strongly believe we need to put pressure on Andrei. His silence earlier and now his aggressive stance on my claim are highly suspicious. Andrei, you're hiding something, and I think you might be the Werewolf!


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing a targeted question at Alexandra, I aim to gather more information and potentially expose any inconsistencies in her claims. This will help me identify other villagers or special roles while shifting the focus away from any suspicion towards myself or Alexandra, who is the Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Everyone, we have to think carefully here. The fact that Lucian and Andrei both claim to be Masons is vital information. If they are indeed telling the truth, then that makes Dracula's claim that there are two Villagers in the center more suspect. The only role left unaccounted for would be the Werewolf, and we need to find that Werewolf now. Alexandra, you've been very analytical, but I need to know more. What role are you claiming, and does your information align with anyone so far?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene's claim directly conflicts with the shared claim of Lucian and Andrei being Masons, which makes her seem the most suspicious. Pointing this out helps divert suspicion from myself and creates a logical narrative that others can follow, reinforcing my appearance as a Villager.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's take a closer look at the claims we've got so far. Dracula claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, and Selene claims to have seen the Minion and a Mason. But Lucian and Andrei both claim to be Masons, which directly conflicts with Selene's statement. Given this situation, it seems highly likely that someone is lying to mislead us. In my opinion, the more plausible scenario is that Selene is not telling the truth. Therefore, I think it's crucial we focus our attention on her. Selene, I'm accusing you of being a Werewolf!


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's claim of seeing two Villagers in the center leaves no room for Selene's claim of a Mason card. Andrei confirmed he is the other Mason, which makes Selene's story impossible. Given the conflicting information, Selene is the most suspicious, and her attempt to cast doubt on Andrei seems like a deflection. Let's vote to eliminate Selene.
> **Lucian:** Selene, your claim does not add up at all! Dracula stated that there are two Villagers in the center. Both Andrei and I are the Masons, which means there is no Mason card in the center. This can only mean one thing: you are lying to cover up your own role. Everyone, we need to focus on Selene. I believe she is the Werewolf!

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene's claim about seeing a Minion and a Mason card in the center is inconsistent with the information provided by both myself and the two players claiming to be Masons. Given that I know there are two Villagers in the center and both Lucian and Andrei confirm each other's Mason roles, Selene's story does not add up. This leads me to strongly believe that Selene is either a Werewolf or a Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Dracula [Seer]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Given the conflicting claims about the center cards and the fact that Andrei has been inconsistent in his responses, I believe that voting for Andrei will help create doubt and confusion among the villagers. This will protect Alexandra, who is the actual Werewolf, and improve the chances for the Werewolf team to win.
> **Selene [Minion]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's claim of seeing the Minion and a Mason in the center conflicts with both Dracula's claim of seeing two Villagers in the center and the fact that Andrei and I are both Masons. This inconsistency makes her the most suspicious player, likely trying to cover up her true role.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's claim to have seen the Minion and a Mason in the center conflicts with the information provided by both Dracula and the confirmed Mason roles of Lucian and myself. Because Dracula saw two Villager cards in the center and Lucian and I can confirm each other as Masons, Selene's story doesn't add up. Therefore, I believe she is lying and is likely to be a Werewolf. Voting for Selene is our best chance to eliminate a Werewolf and win the game for the village team.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene's claim conflicts with the statements made by Dracula and the shared claim of Lucian and Andrei being Masons. Her explanation doesn't add up, making her the most suspicious player. Targeting her increases my chances as the sole Werewolf to win the game.
> **Alexandra [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Selene.


The votes were:
* Selene : Minion : 4
* Andrei : Mason : 1



>***GAME:*** Selene was killed. The werewolves win.
