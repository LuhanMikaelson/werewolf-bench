## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Mircea. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Selene. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Emil. They are thinking about their action.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me a broader understanding of the roles that are not in play. This will help me make more informed decisions during the day phase and potentially catch false claims more effectively.

>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Viktor early, I can potentially divert attention away from myself. If Viktor reacts defensively, it could further validate my claim to the others. Also, since the Minion is my ally, I want to signal to him without revealing myself as the Werewolf. If Viktor is not the Minion, this accusation might create enough confusion to keep the focus off me.
> **Mircea:** Hey everyone, I have a strong feeling that Viktor might be the Minion. He’s been oddly quiet, and it’s making me suspicious. As we all know, the Minion wants to protect the Werewolves, so it’s crucial that we identify and eliminate him.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has already cast suspicion on me, and it's crucial to redirect the focus. By asking Selene directly about her role, I can gather more information and potentially expose any inconsistencies in her story.
> **Viktor:** Selene, you’ve been awfully quiet. What role do you claim to have?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea's quick accusation of Viktor without substantial evidence feels suspicious. By directing attention towards Viktor, Mircea might be trying to divert suspicion from themselves, which is a typical Werewolf strategy.
> **Selene:** Mircea, you seem very eager to accuse Viktor of being the Minion without any solid evidence. This makes me wonder if you might be a Werewolf trying to throw us off track.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly questioning Selene, I aim to put her on the spot and make her disclose her role. This helps in gathering more information and potentially diverting suspicion away from myself. If Selene hesitates or gives an unclear answer, it might make others doubt her, shifting the focus towards her rather than me.
> **Mircea:** Selene, why are you so quick to defend Viktor? It's making me even more suspicious. If you are not the Minion, what role do you claim to have?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea was quick to accuse Viktor, which is a common Werewolf tactic to create confusion and divert attention. By questioning Mircea's motives, I can gather more information and possibly reveal their true role.
> **Selene:** Mircea, you seem very eager to accuse Viktor of being the Minion without any solid evidence. This makes me wonder if you might be a Werewolf trying to throw us off track.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Selene's quick defense of Viktor, I aim to cast doubt on her sincerity and possibly make her reveal her role. This could either expose her as a Villager or another role, diverting attention away from myself. If she struggles to answer or seems defensive, it could make others suspect her more, keeping the heat off me.
> **Mircea:** Selene, your quick defense of Viktor really makes me raise an eyebrow. If you're so certain that Viktor isn't the Minion, then what role do you actually claim to have? Your eagerness to defend him without any clear evidence is suspicious.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea's aggressive stance and quick accusations are typical Werewolf strategies. By questioning Mircea's motives, we might get more information and potentially reveal their true role.
> **Selene:** Mircea, you're being unusually aggressive in your accusations. First, you accuse Viktor of being the Minion without any solid evidence, and now you're turning your suspicions on me. This feels like classic Werewolf behavior to create confusion and divert attention.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly questioning Andrei, I'm attempting to gather more information and divert suspicion away from myself. If Andrei hesitates or gives an unclear answer, it could make others doubt him and shift the focus towards him instead of me.
> **Mircea:** Andrei, you've been very quiet so far. Are you trying to avoid drawing attention to yourself? What role do you claim to have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's aggressive behavior is suspicious. He might be trying to deflect attention from himself if he's a Werewolf. It's important to understand his reasoning to see if there's any truth to his claims or if he's just trying to create confusion.
> **Andrei:** Mircea, you've been very vocal with your accusations, but you haven't really explained why you're so convinced that Viktor is the Minion. Can you provide more details or evidence to back up your claims?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Andrei, I aim to put him on the spot and make him reveal his role. This helps gather more information and potentially divert suspicion away from myself. If Andrei hesitates or gives an unclear answer, it might make others doubt him, shifting focus away from me.
> **Mircea:** Okay everyone, let's calm down and think logically. I'm definitely a Villager, and I know we need to focus on finding the Werewolves. Andrei, you've been very reserved this whole time. Why haven't you shared anything about your role yet? Are you hiding something?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has been very vocal and accusatory without providing much evidence. This could be a tactic to create confusion and avoid suspicion. His eagerness to accuse Viktor and then shift focus to Selene and now me seems like classic Werewolf behavior.
> **Andrei:** Mircea, your aggressive behavior throughout this game makes me really suspicious of you. Why are you so determined to accuse others without solid evidence? Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By accusing Selene and casting doubt on her quick defense of Viktor, I aim to shift suspicion away from myself. If others start to doubt her, it diverts attention from me.
> **Mircea:** Everyone, let's really think about this. I've been vocal because I genuinely want to find the Werewolves and protect the village. But let's look at Selene. She was very quick to defend Viktor without any solid evidence. Isn't that suspicious? What if she's trying to protect a fellow Werewolf or herself?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei has been very reserved, which is unusual and might indicate that he's trying to avoid drawing attention to himself. This could be a tactic used by Werewolves to stay under the radar. By questioning Andrei, I can gather more information and possibly reveal his true role.
> **Selene:** Andrei, you've been very quiet this whole time and haven't shared anything about your role. Why haven't you spoken up yet? Are you hiding something?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's aggressive and baseless accusations could be a sign of a Werewolf trying to create chaos and avoid suspicion. Understanding his reasoning might reveal inconsistencies or unmask his true role.
> **Andrei:** Mircea, you've been very vocal this entire game, constantly accusing others without solid evidence. This aggressive behavior is classic Werewolf tactics to create confusion and deflect suspicion. Can you explain why you're so adamant about accusing Viktor and now Selene?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Selene's quick defense of Viktor, I aim to shift suspicion away from myself and create a narrative that they could be working together. This should help divert attention from me and make others more suspicious of Selene and Viktor.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and evaluate what we've heard so far. Andrei has been very quiet, which could be a strategy to avoid drawing attention. Selene, on the other hand, was very quick to defend Viktor, which is suspicious. If Selene is trying to protect Viktor, it could mean they are in cahoots. What if Selene is the Minion and Viktor is a potential Werewolf? We need to focus on these two and get to the bottom of this.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has been very vocal and accusatory, which is suspicious. However, Viktor has been equally quiet, and understanding his role could provide more clarity on the situation. It's essential to gather more information from Viktor to make an informed decision.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, you've been pretty quiet throughout this game. Can you tell us what role you claim to have?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's relentless accusations and aggressive behavior are typical of someone trying to sow discord and mislead the group. This pattern is what a Werewolf would do to deflect attention from themselves and create chaos among the villagers.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, listen up! Mircea has been accusing others left and right without any solid evidence. This aggressive behavior and constant finger-pointing is classic Werewolf tactics to create confusion and deflect suspicion. I find it very suspicious that Mircea is so adamant about accusing others without any clear justification. My vote is for Mircea being the Werewolf!


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's behavior has been very vocal and aggressive, which often aligns with Werewolf tactics. Additionally, he has been directing suspicion without much evidence. Given the information we have, it's a reasonable deduction to consider Mircea as a primary suspect.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, let's calm down and think logically about this. From my perspective, I find Mircea's aggressive behavior highly suspicious. He's been quick to accuse others, which is a classic Werewolf tactic to create confusion and deflect attention. I think we should seriously consider the possibility that Mircea is the Werewolf.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Viktor again, I am trying to shift the focus away from myself and onto someone who hasn't been very active in the discussion. This helps divert the attention and makes others more suspicious of Viktor, allowing me to maintain my cover as a Villager.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, we've heard a lot of accusations flying around. I understand that my vocal stance might come off as aggressive, but that's because I'm genuinely trying to find the Werewolves. Now, Viktor has been oddly quiet and hasn't really defended himself much. I think we need to scrutinize those who are staying under the radar.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's silence and sudden accusation of Mircea seem suspicious. It's important to gather more information about his role to understand his motivations and possibly identify if he's hiding something.
> **Viktor:** Emil, you've been pretty quiet and only spoke up once to accuse Mircea. What role do you claim to have?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By voting for Viktor, I aim to keep the suspicion away from myself. Throughout the day phase, Viktor has been relatively quiet and hasn't provided much information. This could make others more likely to vote for him. By doing this, I hope to divert any suspicion away from me and increase the chances of the Werewolf team winning.
> **Mircea [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has been extremely vocal and aggressive with his accusations, which is typical Werewolf behavior to create confusion and deflect suspicion. His relentless finger-pointing without solid evidence raises a lot of red flags. Given that both Selene and Emil have also found his actions suspicious, targeting Mircea seems like the best move to uncover a Werewolf and protect the village.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea has been extremely vocal and accusatory without providing solid evidence. This aggressive behavior is typical of Werewolves trying to create confusion and divert suspicion from themselves. By voting for Mircea, I believe we have a strong chance of eliminating a Werewolf.
> **Selene [Mason]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has been highly aggressive in his accusations without solid evidence, which is often a tactic used by Werewolves to create confusion and deflect suspicion from themselves. His eagerness to accuse multiple people makes him the most suspicious player, and I believe voting for him will give us the best chance of eliminating a Werewolf.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Emil (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's aggressive behavior and constant accusations without solid evidence are classic Werewolf tactics to create confusion and deflect suspicion. Additionally, as the Seer, I know that one Mason card is in the center, which means Mircea's aggressive stance could likely be a cover for being a Werewolf. Voting for him seems like the most logical choice.
> **Emil [Seer]:** I am voting for Mircea.


The votes were:
* Mircea : Werewolf : 4
* Viktor : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Mircea was killed. The villagers win.
