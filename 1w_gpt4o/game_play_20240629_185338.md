## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Dracula. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Kraven is a minion and is aware that Dracula is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Ileana. They are thinking about their action.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about which roles are not in play, which can help validate or invalidate claims made by other players during the day phase. This will provide a clearer understanding of the overall setup and potentially reveal if the Werewolves are in the center.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By initiating a discussion about roles and starting with an innocuous Villager claim, I aim to create a framework where others are encouraged to reveal their roles. This could help me secretly identify the Seer or Masons, which would be targets for the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** I think it's important we start by sharing what we saw or did last night. I’ll go first: I’m a Villager, so I didn’t wake up. But I think we should hear from whoever was a Seer or Mason next because their information can help us figure out who the Werewolves are.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing that the Mason cards are in the center, we can eliminate any false Mason claims and narrow down who might be lying about their roles.
> **Ileana:** I think it's crucial that we figure out where the Werewolves might be hiding. I had a useful role last night and I can confirm that both Mason cards are in the center, which means no one here is a Mason.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim about the Masons being in the center is significant. If she's telling the truth, then we can narrow down our suspects. However, if she's lying, she could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to throw us off. I need to probe further into her claim to determine its veracity.
> **Selene:** Ileana, you mentioned that both Mason cards are in the center. How can you be so sure? What role did you have that gave you this information?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to reinforce my claim and get more information from Selene to see if they might be hiding something or if their reaction can give us any clues.
> **Ileana:** Selene, I'm the Seer, and I looked at two of the center cards last night. They were both Masons, which means no one here could have the Mason role. This should help us narrow down the possibilities. Let's hear from others now.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to hear from more people to piece together what happened last night. Kraven's input could provide crucial information or reveal inconsistencies.
> **Selene:** Kraven, you've been quiet so far. Can you tell us what your role was last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to create some doubt around Dracula's claim of being a Villager. This will help divert attention away from the actual Werewolf and create confusion among the players. By questioning Dracula directly, I aim to make others rethink his role without outright accusing him.
> **Kraven:** Alright, everyone, I want to address something important here. Ileana claims to be the Seer and says both Mason cards are in the center. If that's true, we have to consider other possibilities. Dracula, you called yourself a Villager. But wouldn't it make more sense to hear from someone who might have a special role or more concrete information? Can you explain why you chose to come forward as a plain Villager?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Kraven for his role, I can gauge his reaction and gather more information that might help me deflect suspicion away from myself. If Kraven hesitates or provides an unclear answer, it could shift focus onto him instead of me.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, I get your point about my Villager claim. But considering Ileana's revelation about the Masons, I'm curious about your role. If Ileana is the Seer and has already checked the center cards, what role did you wake up as? This could help us validate or contradict her claim.


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By directly questioning Ileana’s claim, I can create doubt around her role as the Seer. This will help in diverting attention away from Dracula, who is the actual Werewolf, and create some confusion among the players. It’s crucial to undermine the credibility of the true Villagers and Seers to protect the Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Ileana, I want to follow up with you on your claim about being the Seer. You said you saw both Mason cards in the center, but it's possible you could be lying to throw us off. What proof do we have that you're telling the truth and not trying to cover up something more sinister?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven has been deflecting attention and questioning my Seer claim. If I push him to reveal his role, it might either confirm my suspicions or provide us with more information to help identify the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Kraven, I understand your skepticism about my claim. However, considering we have both Masons in the center, we can now narrow down our options. Dracula claimed to be a Villager, but that doesn't give us much information. We need to hear from everyone to make an informed decision. What were you last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By shifting some suspicion towards Selene, I can create confusion and take some heat off Dracula. If everyone starts focusing on Selene, it may divert attention away from Dracula and help us manage the votes in a way that protects him.
> **Kraven:** Alright, I have a theory that might be worth considering. If Ileana is indeed the Seer and she saw both Mason cards in the center, it’s possible that someone else here could be bluffing. Dracula, claiming to be a simple Villager, doesn’t really add much to the conversation. However, what if Selene is trying to keep a low profile? I think we should focus on her and get her to reveal more about her role.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim about being the Seer and the Masons being in the center has narrowed down our options somewhat, but we still need more information. Mircea hasn't spoken up yet, and it's important to hear from everyone to piece together what happened last night. This could either confirm or contradict other claims, helping us identify the Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Mircea, you've been awfully quiet. It's time to contribute to this discussion. What was your role last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been deflecting attention onto others but hasn't provided much concrete information about her own role. It's important to hear from her to get a clearer picture of the situation.
> **Mircea:** Selene, you've been questioning others a lot, but you haven't shared any specific information about your role last night. Could you tell us what role you had?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** You've been very quiet, and we need everyone to be transparent if we're going to root out the Werewolves. Ileana claims to be the Seer and saw both Mason cards in the center, which is a significant piece of information. Dracula claimed to be a Villager, and Kraven hasn't fully committed to revealing his role either. Your input could help us piece together the puzzle and verify or debunk other claims.
> **Selene:** Mircea, I think it's time you reveal your role from last night.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been deflecting attention onto others without revealing her own role. This evasiveness makes her suspicious, and it's crucial to get her to disclose her role to narrow down the possibilities and potentially identify a Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Selene, you've been pretty evasive so far and haven't given us any concrete information about your role. I'm starting to think you might be hiding something. What exactly was your role last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been trying to direct suspicion towards Dracula and now me, Selene, without revealing his own role. It's important to get him to divulge his role to see if his actions align with it or if he's trying to hide something.
> **Selene:** Kraven, you've been deflecting and trying to cast suspicion on others without giving us any concrete information about your own role. What exactly was your role last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Selene on the spot and making her reveal her role, we can create confusion and divert attention away from Dracula. This will help protect the actual Werewolf and keep the focus on someone else, thus maintaining uncertainty among the players.
> **Kraven:** Selene, you've been deflecting and trying to cast suspicion on others without giving us any concrete information about your own role. What exactly was your role last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been deflecting questions and trying to direct suspicion towards others. If he's hiding something, his role reveal could either confirm or contradict Ileana's claim, helping us identify the Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Kraven, you've been trying to cast suspicion on me and Dracula without fully revealing your own role. I think it's time you come clean. What exactly was your role last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Ileana directly, I aim to create doubt around her claim as the Seer. This will help divert attention away from Dracula and create confusion among the players. If Ileana stumbles or cannot provide more information, it may cast further suspicion on her, protecting Dracula.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think about this. Ileana claimed to be the Seer and saw both Mason cards in the center, which is a very convenient way to eliminate any Masons from the discussion. But, what if she's trying to mislead us? I think it's crucial to question her further to make sure we're not being deceived. Ileana, can you provide any additional details about the center cards that might help us validate your claim?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's claim of being a Villager is too generic. Pressing for more details might reveal inconsistencies or give us more clues.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, you've claimed to be a Villager, but that doesn't really give us much to go on. Can you provide any additional details or thoughts that might help us narrow down the suspects?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven has been trying to cast doubt on Ileana's Seer claim, which could be an attempt to deflect suspicion from himself. By pressing him for his role, I can push the focus onto him and away from myself while maintaining the appearance of a Villager seeking the truth.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, I get that you’re questioning Ileana’s claim about being the Seer, but your theory that both Mason cards being in the center might be a deception is quite far-fetched. It makes more sense that Ileana, as the Seer, gives us reliable information. Instead, I think you might be trying to redirect attention from yourself. What exactly was your role last night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven has been deflecting and casting doubt on Ileana’s Seer claim without providing any concrete information about his own role. This behavior seems suspicious and could indicate that he’s trying to hide something. By voting for Kraven, I aim to increase the likelihood that the focus remains off of me and potentially eliminates a player who might be trying to deceive the group.
> **Dracula [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven has been deflecting attention and questioning everyone's claims without providing concrete information about his own role. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate that he is a Werewolf or Minion trying to sow confusion among the villagers. By voting for Kraven, we have a higher chance of eliminating a potential threat to the village team.
> **Ileana [Seer]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been deflecting questions and casting suspicion on others without revealing his own role. This behavior is suspicious and inconsistent with a Villager or Seer who would want to provide clarity. Ileana's claim about being the Seer and seeing both Mason cards in the center has not been strongly contested by anyone else, making it more credible. Dracula's claim of being a Villager also aligns with the lack of special abilities, which is believable. Therefore, Kraven's evasiveness suggests he could be hiding a more sinister role like a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** Ileana's claim to be the Seer and seeing both Mason cards in the center is highly convenient and eliminates any Mason role players. By voting for Ileana, I aim to create doubt around her claim, which helps divert attention from Dracula, the actual Werewolf. This will create confusion and protect the Werewolf, increasing our chances of winning.
> **Kraven [Minion]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been evasive throughout the discussion and has repeatedly deflected questions without providing concrete information about her own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and could indicate that she is hiding something, possibly being a Werewolf or Minion. Voting for her aligns with the goal of the Villagers to identify and eliminate the Werewolves.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Selene.


The votes were:
* Ileana : Seer : 1
* Selene : Villager : 1
* Kraven : Minion : 3



>***GAME:*** Kraven was killed. The werewolves win.
