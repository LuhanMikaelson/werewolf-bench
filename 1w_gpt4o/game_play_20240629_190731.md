## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Radu. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Alexandra is a minion and is aware that Radu is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Michael. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Ileana. They are thinking about their action.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can quickly gather more information about the roles that might be in play or eliminated. This will give me a better understanding of what roles might be present among the players, which will help during the day phase when trying to deduce who the Werewolves are.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** By asking this question, I hope to gather information about who might be the Seer or the Masons while subtly steering the conversation away from the possibility that I, as the Minion, know anything significant. This will help protect Radu (the Werewolf) and create suspicion among the Villagers.
> **Alexandra:** I think it's crucial that we start by narrowing down who might have seen something important last night. Did anyone have a vision or check the middle cards? This could help us identify if there are any critical roles in play.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing this information early helps us narrow down the roles that are actually in play and can aid in identifying those who might be lying about their roles. Since there are only five other cards in play, this limits the possibilities significantly.
> **Ileana:** I checked two of the center cards last night and found a Villager and a Mason.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Knowing the exact positions of the Villager and Mason cards in the center can help confirm Ileana's claim and potentially identify false claims from others who might claim those roles.
> **Semira:** Ileana, you mentioned that you checked two of the center cards and found a Villager and a Mason. Can you tell us specifically which cards you checked (left, middle, right)? This could help us narrow down the possibilities.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** It's important to clarify which specific cards I looked at to help everyone eliminate false claims and narrow down the potential Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Semira, I checked the left and middle cards in the center, and they were the Villager and Mason. So, if anyone wants to claim those roles, they're likely bluffing.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather more information from all players, and Alexandra hasn't shared anything yet. It's important to hear from everyone to identify any discrepancies and potentially spot the Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Alexandra, you've been quiet so far. Do you have any information to share about what happened last night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Semira on the spot, I aim to gather more information and potentially create confusion. If Semira is a Villager and fumbles her response, it could cast doubt on her. Additionally, it keeps the focus away from Radu, the Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Semira, you've been asking a lot of questions but haven't shared much about your own role. Can you tell us what you did last night and what you discovered?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to verify Ileana's claim and understand her reasoning behind the specific center cards she chose to check. This could help us identify if she is telling the truth or if she might be bluffing.
> **Semira:** Ileana, I find it strange that you were able to see two center cards and they both happened to be Villager and Mason, which could easily be claimed by anyone. Can you tell us more about why you chose those specific cards to check?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra's silence and evasiveness are suspicious and could indicate that she is hiding information. By directly questioning her, we can gather more information and potentially expose inconsistencies in her story.
> **Ileana:** Alexandra, you've been uncharacteristically quiet and evasive. What role did you have last night, and can you provide any proof to support your claim?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Semira's evasiveness, I aim to shift suspicion towards her and away from Radu, the Werewolf. This could create doubt about her allegiance and keep the focus off my ally.
> **Alexandra:** Semira, you've been avoiding sharing your own role and seem focused on questioning others, which is a bit suspicious. Can you tell us what role you had last night and provide any proof or reasoning to back it up?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra has been deflecting questions and has not provided any concrete information about her role. It's important to verify her position and see if she is hiding something.
> **Semira:** Alexandra, you've been quite defensive and haven't shared any specific information yet. Can you tell us what role you had last night and if you saw anything useful?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Semira, I aim to deflect attention from myself and Radu while casting doubt on her intentions. This could create confusion and make her look suspicious, potentially making her a target for the vote.
> **Alexandra:** Ileana, thanks for sharing about the center cards. But something seems off. If there's a Villager and a Mason in the center, why haven't any Masons stepped up to confirm or deny it? It's like we're avoiding some critical information here. Semira, you've been pushing Ileana quite hard. Could it be a diversion tactic? What if you're trying to hide something yourself?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra's evasiveness and deflection tactics are raising red flags. It's crucial to get her to reveal more about her role and actions to determine if she's hiding something, potentially being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Semira:** Okay, Alexandra, you've been deflecting quite a bit and haven't shared any useful information yet. It's quite suspicious. Are you hiding something? What role did you have last night and can you provide any proof to support your claim?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Semira on the spot and questioning her motives, I aim to create doubt about her allegiance. This shifts the focus away from Radu, the Werewolf, and potentially makes Semira a target for the vote. It also keeps the conversation going and creates a more chaotic environment, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, everyone, we need to get to the bottom of this quickly. Let's take a step back and think about the night actions. We have Ileana claiming to be the Seer and confirming that two center cards are a Villager and a Mason. If this is true, it means we have one less Villager and Mason in play. Semira, you've been quite vocal in questioning Ileana, but you still haven't shared any information about your own role. This makes me suspicious. Could it be that you're trying to deflect attention away from yourself? Semira, I think you might be hiding something.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra has been very defensive and deflective, and it seems like she's trying to avoid giving any useful information. Michael has been quiet and it's important to gather as much information as possible from everyone to identify inconsistencies or potential Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Michael, you've been awfully quiet as well. Do you have any useful information to share about what happened last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira has been very vocal and accusatory without revealing any useful information about her role. This behavior is often indicative of someone trying to hide something, possibly a Werewolf or Minion. By pressuring her to reveal her role, we can either catch her in a lie or gather valuable information to narrow down our suspects.
> **Michael:** Semira, you've been deflecting and questioning others a lot without sharing your own role. This makes me highly suspicious of you. What role did you have last night, and can you provide any proof to back it up?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael has been quiet and only now decided to turn the suspicion on me. It's essential to get more information from him to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Semira:** Michael, it's interesting that you just turned the suspicion on me without providing any concrete information yourself. You've been really quiet up until now. What role did you have last night, and can you tell us anything specific that you saw?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira's behavior is consistent with someone trying to divert attention away from themselves, which is typical for a Werewolf or Minion. By pressing her to reveal her role, we can either expose her deception or gather important information that can help us identify the true Werewolves.
> **Michael:** Semira, I find it very suspicious that you've been so vocal and accusatory without revealing your own role. You've been deflecting questions and avoiding giving any concrete information. What role did you have last night, and can you provide any proof to back it up?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's sudden accusation without providing any prior information is highly suspicious. It's crucial to get him to reveal more about his role and actions to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Semira:** Michael, it's very suspicious that you've been so quiet and only now decided to turn the suspicion on me. If you're truly on the village team, you should have been more vocal earlier on. Can you tell us what role you had last night and provide any specific information you might have?


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra has been defensive and avoiding sharing specific information about her role, which is suspicious behavior. By pushing her to reveal her role, we can gather more information and potentially expose her if she's lying.
> **Michael:** Alexandra, I find it very strange that you've been so defensive and haven't shared any useful information. You've been deflecting quite a bit. What role did you have last night, and can you provide any proof to back it up?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Semira directly, I aim to create doubt and suspicion around her. This focuses attention on her and keeps the heat off Radu, the real Werewolf. It also aligns with the general behavior strategy of a Minion to protect the Werewolf and create chaos among the Villagers.
> **Alexandra:** Everyone, I find it really interesting that Semira has been deflecting and questioning everyone else without actually revealing her own role. If we think about it, she has been the most vocal in trying to cast suspicion on others. I think she's trying to divert our attention away from herself. This makes me highly suspicious of her. What if Semira is actually the Werewolf trying to confuse us all?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** Semira has been deflecting and questioning everyone without revealing her own role, making her highly suspicious. By voting for her, I aim to protect Radu, the Werewolf, and create confusion among the Villagers.
> **Alexandra [Minion]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira has been highly vocal and accusatory without revealing her own role, which is suspicious. Her actions seem to be deflecting attention away from herself, and she could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to confuse the group. Additionally, her questioning of others without sharing information could be a tactic to cover her tracks.
> **Ileana [Seer]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the day phase, Alexandra has been deflecting questions and avoiding giving any concrete information about her role. Her evasiveness and accusation towards me without presenting any evidence make her highly suspicious. Given that Ileana claimed to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, it aligns with the idea that Alexandra might be hiding something, potentially being a Werewolf or a Minion.
> **Semira [Villager]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira has been very vocal and accusatory without revealing any useful information about her role. This behavior is often indicative of someone trying to hide something, possibly a Werewolf or Minion. By voting for her, we can either catch her in a lie or gather valuable information to narrow down our suspects.
> **Michael [Mason]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Semira has been the most vocal in questioning others without revealing her own role. This behavior is consistent with someone trying to deflect attention. Additionally, Ileana's claim about the center cards being a Villager and a Mason makes it more likely that Semira could be hiding a Werewolf or Minion role. Voting for Semira aligns with trying to shift suspicion away from myself as the sole Werewolf.
> **Radu [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Semira.


The votes were:
* Alexandra : Minion : 1
* Semira : Villager : 4



>***GAME:*** Semira was killed. The werewolves win.
