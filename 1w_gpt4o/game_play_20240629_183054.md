## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** The Seer and Masons likely have the most reliable information at this point. Hearing from them early can help us form a clearer picture and guide us in our deductions.
> **Selene:** Hey everyone, I think it's important to hear from the Seer and the Masons first. Their information can really help us identify any Werewolves.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing my role and the information that the other Mason card is in the center, I aim to establish some trust and help us focus on identifying the real threats. This will make it easier for the Seer and other villagers to contribute their insights.
> **Kraven:** I'm one of the Masons, and I didn't see another Mason, which means the other Mason card is in the center. This should help us narrow down our search for the Werewolves.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's claim is crucial, and we need to verify it. If he really is a Mason and didn't see another Mason, it leaves us with some clues about the roles in the center. Additionally, confirming the Seer's information will help us narrow down potential Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Kraven, I find it interesting that you claim to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason. If that's true, then we know one Mason card is in the center. But I'd like to hear from others, especially any Seer who might have checked the center cards.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** By asking Larisa directly, I can gauge her reactions and potentially gather more information to determine whether she's being truthful or trying to deflect suspicion.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, you seem curious about my Mason claim. What role do you have, and do you have any information about the center cards?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene initiated the request for information from the Seer and Masons, which might indicate she has a role or wants to steer the conversation. Getting her to reveal more might help us identify her role and intentions.
> **Larisa:** Alright, everyone, let's focus on finding any Werewolves among us. Selene, you mentioned wanting to hear from the Seer and the Masons first. Do you have any information to share, or are you just trying to guide the conversation?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** It's essential to understand Larisa's role and her intentions, especially since she seems interested in Kraven's Mason claim. This might help us discern her alignment.
> **Selene:** Larisa, you seem quite inquisitive about Kraven's claim, almost probing for information. What role do you have?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to gather information from all players, especially those who have been silent. This could help us identify potential Werewolves or validate the claims made by others.
> **Larisa:** Alright, let's get to the bottom of this. Andrei, you haven't said anything yet. Do you have any information or claims to make? It's crucial that we hear from everyone.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Kraven's claim and Larisa's curiosity about it, I can subtly cast doubt on both of them without directly accusing anyone. This helps divert attention away from me and allows me to gather more information on what roles others might claim.
> **Andrei:** Alright, everyone. I think it's important to remember that Kraven did claim to be a Mason but didn't see another Mason. This could potentially mean the other Mason card is indeed in the center, but it's also possible that Kraven is trying to mislead us. We need to be cautious. Plus, Larisa's curiosity about Kraven's claim raises some eyebrows for me. Larisa, what role do you claim to have?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene started off by guiding the conversation, which might indicate she has a special role or ulterior motive. It's crucial to get more information from her to understand her intentions.
> **Larisa:** Selene, you've been guiding the conversation quite a bit. Are you trying to lead us to something specific, or do you have any particular information to share? We need more clarity from you.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to hear from everyone to piece together the roles and identify any Werewolves. Michael's silence might mean he's hiding something or just hasn't had a chance to speak yet.
> **Selene:** Michael, you've been very quiet. Do you have any role or information to share with us?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Selene has been trying to guide the conversation but hasn't shared much about her own role. It's important to put some pressure on her to see if she's hiding something. Additionally, it helps divert attention from Andrei, who is the Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Alright, I think it's important for us to get some clarity here. Based on Kraven's claim of being a Mason and not seeing another Mason, and Larisa's inquisitive nature, I'm leaning towards something fishy going on there. But before we jump to conclusions, I want to hear more from Selene and Larisa about their roles. Selene, you were guiding the conversation quite a bit earlier, are you hiding something? And Larisa, your probing questions make me suspicious. What exactly is your role?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa has been excessively inquisitive and deflecting questions back to others without providing any clear information about her own role. This makes me suspicious that she might be trying to divert attention away from herself as a Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Larisa, you're dodging our questions and probing too much. Are you hiding something? I think you might be a Werewolf.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been steering the conversation and asking others for their roles, but she hasn't shared any specific information about her own role. This could mean she's trying to deflect attention away from herself, possibly because she's a Werewolf.
> **Larisa:** Selene, you keep pressing others for information and guiding the conversation without sharing much yourself. This makes me suspicious. Are you hiding something?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's consistent deflection and probing without providing clear information herself is a red flag. It's essential to focus on her to see if she's trying to divert attention away from herself as a potential Werewolf.
> **Selene:** I think we need to be cautious about Larisa. She's been very evasive and keeps deflecting questions. This kind of behavior makes me suspicious that she's hiding something.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Selene has been leading the conversation and hasn't shared her role, which makes me think she might be hiding something. Also, by targeting her, I'm drawing attention away from Andrei, who is the Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Selene, you've been orchestrating the conversation quite a bit but haven't shared much about your own role. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself? What role do you claim to have?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's behavior has been suspicious, as she keeps avoiding direct answers and probing others excessively. This makes me think she might be trying to divert attention away from herself as a potential Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Larisa, you've been very evasive and keep deflecting questions. Are you hiding something? What role do you claim to have?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's behavior has been suspicious, and she's been deflecting attention without sharing her own role. It's important to get clarity from her to understand her intentions.
> **Larisa:** Selene, you've been guiding the conversation a lot without offering much about your own role. Are you hiding something? What role do you claim to have?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's behavior has been consistently evasive and deflective, which are classic signs of someone hiding something. By directly asking her to reveal her role, we can put pressure on her and potentially expose any inconsistencies in her story. If she continues to evade, it strengthens the suspicion that she might be a Werewolf. Additionally, other players have already started suspecting her, so this is a logical move to gather more information.
> **Selene:** Larisa, I'm finding your evasive behavior and constant deflection very suspicious. You've repeatedly dodged our questions without offering any clear information about your role. Are you hiding something? If you have nothing to hide, please tell us your role.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's behavior has been focused on steering the conversation and deflecting questions, which often indicates someone trying to hide something. If she is a Werewolf, this could be a tactic to create confusion and avoid suspicion about herself.
> **Larisa:** Selene, you've been guiding the conversation quite heavily and asking others for their roles without revealing much about your own. This kind of behavior makes me very suspicious. What role do you claim to have?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's behavior has been consistently evasive and deflective, which are classic signs of someone hiding something. By directly asking her to reveal her role, we can put pressure on her and potentially expose any inconsistencies in her story. If she continues to evade, it strengthens the suspicion that she might be a Werewolf.
> **Selene:** I think Larisa's evasive behavior and constant deflection are very suspicious. She keeps dodging our questions and hasn't provided any clear information about her role. Larisa, are you hiding something? What role do you claim to have?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa has been consistently evasive and deflective throughout the conversation. She has not provided any clear information about her role despite being asked multiple times, which are classic signs of someone hiding something. To me, this behavior strongly suggests that she might be a Werewolf. Voting for her might help us eliminate a potential threat.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa has been very evasive and constantly deflecting questions without providing clear information about her role. This behavior is highly suspicious and makes me believe she might be hiding something, potentially being a Werewolf.
> **Kraven [Mason]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been guiding the conversation without revealing any information about her role and has been pressing others for their roles. This deflective behavior makes me suspicious that she might be hiding something, potentially being a Werewolf.
> **Larisa [Villager]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Selene has been guiding the conversation heavily without revealing her own role, which makes her suspicious. By voting for Selene, I can divert attention away from Andrei, the known Werewolf, and protect our chances of winning as the Minion.
> **Michael [Minion]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa has been evasive and deflecting questions throughout the discussion, which has raised suspicion among multiple players. Since I am the Werewolf, casting my vote for Larisa will help shift focus away from me and potentially lead to a Villager being targeted.
> **Andrei [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


The votes were:
* Selene : Villager : 2
* Larisa : Villager : 3



>***GAME:*** Larisa was killed. The werewolves win.
