## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Stefan. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Vladimir. They are thinking about their action.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles that are not in play. This can help narrow down the possibilities and make it easier to identify the Werewolves and other roles during the Day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking for information about the center cards, I can gauge who might be the Seer or the Drunk without revealing too much about myself. This can help me identify potential threats and allies.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, let's think clearly about what we've seen so far. I'm curious if anyone has information that might help us narrow down who the Werewolves could be. Has anyone seen a card in the center they can share about?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to start narrowing down the possibilities. If Ileana has information from the center, it could help us piece together who the Werewolves might be.
> **Lucian:** Alright, let's get some clarity here. Ileana, have you seen any cards in the center?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm trying to gather more information and see if anyone else has insights that might reveal the Werewolves or the Minion. This can help us narrow down our suspicions and focus our efforts.
> **Ileana:** I haven't seen any cards in the center, but I'm curious if anyone has seen a Werewolf or Minion.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan initiated the conversation, which could be a tactic to steer suspicion away from himself. It's worth verifying if he has any information.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, let's piece together what we know. Stefan, you seem to be asking a lot of questions. Did you see anything during the night?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to have seen a Villager card in the center, I cast doubt on anyone else who claims to be a Villager and divert suspicion away from myself. It also makes me seem helpful and cooperative, which can build trust.
> **Stefan:** Alexandra, you're right, I did see something last night. I actually saw one of the center cards, and I can confirm it was the Villager card. This means that we have one less Villager card to worry about and should help narrow down our search for the Werewolves.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been quiet, and we need more information from him to piece things together. If he has seen something, it might help us identify any inconsistencies and narrow down who the Werewolves might be.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, if Stefan saw a Villager card in the center, that means we have two Villagers left in play. Lucian, you haven't said much yet. Did you see anything during the night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** If Stefan can confirm the exact position of the Villager card, it might help us verify if his claim is true or not. This information is crucial because if he's lying, it could mean he has a different role, possibly a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian:** Stefan, you say you saw a Villager card in the center. Can you confirm exactly which position it was in?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Directing the question to Lucian applies pressure on him to provide information, which could reveal inconsistencies or further clues. This helps me gather more data on the roles in play while keeping the spotlight off myself.
> **Stefan:** Lucian, since I already mentioned that I saw a Villager card in the center, I'm wondering if you could share any information you have? Did you see a card or maybe even another player's role? Any details could help us piece this together.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan claims to have seen a Villager card in the center, but without knowing which position, it's hard to validate his story. If we can confirm the position, it might help us determine if he's telling the truth or possibly hiding something.
> **Lucian:** Stefan, if you really saw a Villager card in the center, can you confirm which position it was in? We need to verify your claim to make sure you're not just trying to throw us off.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Applying pressure on Lucian might reveal inconsistencies in his story or prompt him to slip up. By keeping him on the defensive, I can divert attention away from myself and possibly identify his role.
> **Stefan:** Lucian, you've been oddly quiet about what you've seen or done. I'm starting to wonder if you're hiding something. Could you tell us what your role is and if you saw anything helpful during the night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** If Stefan is telling the truth, knowing the exact position of the Villager card in the center helps us validate his claim. If he continues to avoid the question, it might indicate he's hiding something.
> **Lucian:** Stefan, I find it odd that you keep dodging the question about which position the Villager card was in the center. Can you please confirm its exact position?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian has been avoiding directly answering questions about his role or what he has seen. Pressuring him might reveal inconsistencies or force him to provide information that could help identify his role and whether he's trustworthy. Keeping the focus on him also helps divert suspicion away from myself.
> **Stefan:** Alright, everyone, I think it's time we start piecing together all the information we have. So far, I've mentioned seeing a Villager card in the center, which means we have fewer Villagers in play. Lucian, you're still avoiding answering the question directly. If you have nothing to hide, can you please tell us what your role is and if you have any useful information? This could help us a lot.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's evasion makes it seem like he could be hiding something, potentially a Werewolf or Minion. If he were truthful, he should have no problem giving us the exact position to help confirm his story.
> **Lucian:** Listen everyone, I think Stefan's reluctance to specify the exact position of the Villager card in the center is suspicious. We need to be careful about trusting his claim.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I looked at two center cards during the night and saw both Mason cards. This information can help us identify who might be lying and narrow down our search for the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Listen everyone, I have some important information to share. I know for a fact that the two Mason cards are in the center. This means that anyone claiming to be a Mason is lying.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's continuous dodging of the question about the Villager card's position makes me think he might be hiding something. If we can get more specific information from him, it might help us determine if he's being truthful or not.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, I find Stefan's reluctance to specify the exact position of the Villager card in the center quite suspicious. If he really saw it, there should be no problem in revealing which position it was in.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By accusing Ileana of being a Werewolf, I'm diverting attention away from myself and trying to create doubt about her role. This move could pressure her into revealing more information or cause others to suspect her, thus taking some heat off of me.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, listen up. I'm starting to get a bit suspicious of Ileana. She's been quick to point fingers and hasn't provided any solid information about her role or what she's seen. If she were really a Villager or had any useful insights, I think she would have been more forthcoming by now.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's claim about the Mason cards being in the center is crucial. If we can verify the positions, we can confirm his information and reduce the potential roles in play, making it easier to identify the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Vladimir, you mentioned that the two Mason cards are in the center. Can you tell us which positions they are in? This will help us verify your claim and narrow down our search for the Werewolves.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana has been quick to accuse Stefan without providing any useful information of her own. If she is hiding something, this could help us uncover it and narrow down the possibilities.
> **Vladimir:** Ileana, you questioned Stefan's reluctance, but you haven't shared any information yourself. What role did you have during the night, and did you see anything helpful?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** If Vladimir can confirm the exact positions of the Mason cards, we can verify his claim and eliminate the possibility of anyone pretending to be a Mason. This will help us focus on identifying the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Alright Vladimir, you said the two Mason cards are in the center. Can you tell us which positions those Mason cards are in? This will help us verify your claim and narrow down our search for the Werewolves.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan's reluctance to specify the exact position of the Villager card is suspicious. If he really saw it, he should have no problem providing this information. This will help us verify his claim and narrow down our search for the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Stefan, you still haven't answered Lucian's question about the exact position of the Villager card you claim to have seen in the center. If you're telling the truth, this should be easy to answer. Can you please clarify?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana has been quick to point fingers and hasn't provided any solid information about her role or what she has seen. This behavior seems suspicious, and by voting for her, I can divert attention away from myself and create doubt about her role.
> **Stefan [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan has been evasive about the exact position of the Villager card he claims to have seen in the center. This reluctance raises suspicion that he might be hiding something, possibly a Werewolf or Minion role. Additionally, Vladimir's claim that the two Mason cards are in the center contradicts Stefan's information, which further casts doubt on Stefan's honesty. Voting for Stefan seems like the best option to eliminate a potential threat to the village.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan has been suspiciously avoiding answering Lucian's question about the exact position of the Villager card he claims to have seen in the center. Additionally, Vladimir's claim about the two Mason cards being in the center further casts doubt on Stefan, as he didn't challenge this or provide additional useful information. Both Ileana and Lucian have been consistent in questioning Stefan, making them seem more trustworthy.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan's reluctance to specify the exact position of the Villager card he claimed to have seen in the center is highly suspicious. Given that I know both Mason cards are in the center, Stefan's behavior and lack of concrete information strongly suggest he might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive the rest of us.
> **Vladimir [Seer]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's reluctance to specify the exact position of the Villager card in the center is highly suspicious. Additionally, he has been quick to deflect attention, which aligns with the behavior of someone trying to hide something. Based on the information provided and the way he has been acting, I believe Stefan is the best candidate to vote for.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Stefan.


The votes were:
* Stefan : Werewolf : 4
* Ileana : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Stefan was killed. The villagers win.
