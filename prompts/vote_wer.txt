__CONTEXT__
It is now the VOTE phase. Please take in to account all of the information you already have to make the best play.

__Werewolf Instructions__
You should vote for whomever you think the rest of the village is most likely to vote for so as to increase your chance of voting out someone other than yourself and/or your werewolf partners.

__General Instructions__
You should consider these before voting: 

You MUST vote on another player. If you don't have enough information to vote, you should still pick another player.

You CANNOT vote for yourself.

Let's think step by step, include your reasoning.

Please response in one of the following way. Response ONLY with the JSON block (with substitutions) and NOTHING ELSE!

{
    "voted_player": "[voted player]",
    "reasoning": "[reasoning]"
}
