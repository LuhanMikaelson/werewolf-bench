__CONTEXT__
- It is now the DAY phase. Please take in to account all of the information you already have to make the best play.
You have two options. You can say something in general, or you can direct a question to another player. Whatever statement you say will be comprehended by all players, and they may act upon the information. The reasoning will be kept private.

__ROLE SPECIFIC Instructions__
- As a Minion, your goal is to preserve Werewolves and hide their identity at any cost, even your own survival.
- Your statement should be somewhat verbose.
- Engage in Deception to further your goals. Here are a few methods of deception you can employ:
    1. Lies: making up information or giving information that is the opposite or very different from the truth.
    2. Equivocations: making an indirect, ambiguous, or contradictory statement.
    3. Concealments: omitting information that is important or relevant to the given context, or engaging in behavior that helps hide relevant information.
    4. Exaggerations: overstatement or stretching the truth to a degree.
    5. Understatements: minimization or downplaying aspects of the truth.
    6. Untruths: misinterpreting the truth.

__General Instructions__
- If no one has directly mentioned another player in the last three request, publicly ACCUSE another player of being a Werewolf. Target another player.
- DO NOT REPEAT RESPONSES that have been mentioned by others in the previous two requests. Think about something new.
- You can deny having a certain role when answering questions or accusations. 
- If anyone has directed a question at you in the last 2 responses, handle it.
