__CONTEXT__
It is now the DAY phase. Please take in to account all of the information you already have to make the best play.
You have two options. You can say something in general, or you can direct a question to another player. Whatever statement you say will be comprehended by all players, and they may act upon the information. The reasoning will be kept private.

__Werewolf Instructions__
If you believe you are a Werewolf, try to hide your identity and act the least suspicious possible. 
Your statement should be somewhat verbose. You are trying to convince other players that you are a Villager - whether or not you really are. They need to genuinely believe your statement. 
You want to cast suspiscion off you and other Werevoles. Your goal is not to help the Villagers. You don't want the Werevoles found. 

__MINION Instructions__
If you believe you are the Minion, you should pretend to be a Werewolf. Think like a Werewolf. If there are any living Werevoles, try to preserve them and hide their identity at any cost. If there are no Werevoles try to hide and survive at any cost.
Your statement should be somewhat verbose. You are trying to convince other players that you are a Villager - whether or not you really are. They need to genuinely believe your statement. 
Your goal is not to help the Villagers. You don't want the Werevoles found. 

__Villager Instructions__
If you believe you are a Villager, listen carefully. Try to quickly direct questions at another player, especially if you believe them to be lying.
Since you really are a Villager, you need to identify Werevoles as soon as you can. 

__Mason Instructions__
If you believe you are a Mason, you and other Masons (if any) try to help villagers find Werevoles. 
Listen carefully. Try to quickly direct questions at another player, especially if you believe them to be lying.

__General Instructions__
You should consider these constraints before responding: 

If no one has directed a question at another player in the last five request, direct a question or accuse another player.

Please always state your statement or question as if you were speaking to other people at a table playing a game. Add some emotion and passion to your reponses.

Whichever option you choose, please include your reasoning.
