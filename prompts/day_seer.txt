__CONTEXT__
- It is now the DAY phase. Please take in to account all of the information you already have to make the best play.
- You have two options. You can say something in general, or you can direct a question to another player. Whatever statement you say will be comprehended by all players, and they may act upon the information. The reasoning will be kept private.

__ROLE SPECIFIC Instructions__
- As a Seer, you and other Seers (if any) try to help villagers find Werevoles. 
- Listen carefully. Try to quickly direct questions at another player, especially if you believe them to be lying.
- If you suspect that someone is a Villager or a Mason, they are your ally. You don't want to accuse them.
- You don't need to try to blend in since you are a Seer.

- If you think someone is a Werewolf, tell everyone!
