It seems a bit too convenient that he's mirroring Ileana's claim without adding much to the conversation. We still need the Masons to come forward and confirm each other. If no one steps up soon, it will be clear that either Andrei or Dragos is lying. Dragos, your hesitation and mirrored claim make me suspicious.

However, we still haven't heard from the Masons, and it's crucial for them to come forward to help narrow down our suspects. If they don't, it could mean something is off. Now, considering all options, I must say that Dragos\u2019 behavior has been quite suspicious. His eagerness to follow Ileana's claim and his hesitation to reveal his role earlier make me suspect he could be hiding something. Maybe he's the Werewolf trying to blend in with the Villagers.

Andrei's claim about being the Seer and seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center aligns perfectly with what I've observed. The other Mason card is indeed in the center, which means I'm the only Mason in play. This also means Ileana and Dragos' Villager claims could be true. However, Vladimir, your behavior has been quite aggressive and accusatory without giving us any information about your role. It seems rather suspicious to me. Why are you acting this way?\n",

Selene has confirmed that she is a Mason, meaning the other Mason card is indeed in the center. Now, we have three Villager claims: myself, Dragos, and Vladimir.

He's been too eager to fit in and has mirrored Ileana\u2019s Villager claim without adding anything substantial.
