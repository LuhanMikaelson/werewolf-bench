Stefan claimed to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, which checks out with the number of Villager and Mason claims we've had. But we still have some roles unaccounted for and there could be deception. Mircea, Vladimir, and Emil have all claimed to be Villagers, but that leaves us with potentially two Werewolves and a Minion among us.
