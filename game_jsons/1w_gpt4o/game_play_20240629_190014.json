It's a simple and straightforward role, which makes sense given that there are three in this game. We need to quickly identify who's acting suspiciously.

            "utterance": "Vladimir, you're being very cautious and it's making me suspicious. We now know that the Minion is in the center, so your reluctance to trust Semira's simple claim as a Villager is puzzling. Are you trying to shift our focus away from something?

I'm inclined to believe Semira's Villager claim for now. However, if there are any Masons here, you need to come forward and confirm your presence.
