Andrei might be pushing for the Seer to reveal themselves, which could be a strategy to gather information if he's on the Werewolf team.

First, he was quick to deflect suspicion onto me when I asked for the Seer, and then he\u2019s been playing it safe by not providing any useful information. My guess is that he's trying to avoid drawing attention to himself. I ACCUSE Dracula of being a Werewolf.\n",

He's been pushing really hard for the Seer to come forward, which seems like a risky move for the village. It could be a tactic to flush out the Seer if he's on the Werewolf team.

Andrei has been pushing really hard to get the Seer to reveal themselves, which could be a strategic move if he's on the Werewolf team.

Stefan's been relatively quiet, and then suddenly accused Andrei, which could be an attempt to shift focus. My gut tells me that Andrei might be trying to flush out the Seer for the Werewolves.
