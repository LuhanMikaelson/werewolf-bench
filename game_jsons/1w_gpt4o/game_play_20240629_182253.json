If there are two Villager cards in the center, that means we are left with only one Villager among us.

Since Dracula has already given us some crucial information about the center cards, I'm going to reveal that I'm the Seer. I looked at two cards in the center and saw the Minion and a Mason card. This means that the Minion role is in the center, and we have only one Mason among us.

This means one of two things: either Dracula or Selene is lying, or we've got a more complex situation at hand.

Now, Lucian and Andrei both claim to be Masons, which means my claim about the Mason card is conflicting, but let's consider this: If Andrei and Lucian are both Masons, then they should have seen each other during the night phase.
