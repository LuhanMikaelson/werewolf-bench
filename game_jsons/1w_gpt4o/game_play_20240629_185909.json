If Alexandra is telling the truth about being the Seer and seeing two Villager cards in the center, that means we have one unknown card left in the center.

I find it odd that you're quick to challenge me but haven't given us anything we can work with. If you're really on the villagers' side, you need to be more forthcoming.
