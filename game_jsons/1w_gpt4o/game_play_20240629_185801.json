If Michael is truly the Seer and has seen two Villager cards in the center, that leaves us with one Villager unaccounted for among us. Alexandra claims to be that Villager, but that's unprovable. Dracula, you haven't claimed a role yet. Since you were asked earlier and didn't respond, I think it would be helpful if you told us what role you have.\n",

That leaves us with one Villager card among us. Alexandra and I have both claimed to be Villagers, but there should be one more role we haven't heard from yet.

Given the current situation, I\u2019m inclined to believe Michael's Seer claim because it adds up with the cards in the center.
