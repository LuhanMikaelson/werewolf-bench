So, let's think about the roles left: Seer, Minion, Villagers, and potentially a Drunk. We should focus on figuring out if anyone might be the Minion or the Seer, as they hold the key to identifying the Werewolves. Personally, I didn't see anything remarkable last night, but something feels off with Andrei. Andrei, did you take any actions last night?\n",

            "utterance": "Alright, everyone, let's think this through logically. Emil claims to have seen both Mason cards in the center, which means we don't have any Masons among us. If that's true, we still have a Seer, a Minion, and Villagers to account for. I'm starting to get a bit suspicious of Michael. He seems a bit too eager to get information from Emil, almost like he's trying to steer the discussion away from himself. Michael, what do you have to say about your actions last night?\n",

            "utterance": "Selene, I understand why you might be suspicious of me, but I'd like to point out that if Emil's information is accurate, then we need to establish the Seer's identity to cross-verify. Emil, can you provide any additional details about your night actions?\n",

            "utterance": "Selene, I understand your concern, but I think it's important to dig deeper into Emil's claim. Emil, you mentioned both Mason cards are in the center, which is a strong claim. Can you tell us which two specific cards you saw in the center?\n",

However, Emil's story seems quite convenient, and it's possible he's trying to mislead us. Dragos, you mentioned earlier that something feels off about Andrei.
