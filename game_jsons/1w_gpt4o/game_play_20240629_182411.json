Since no one else has directly mentioned another player in a while, I'm going to make an accusation. I think Dragos is acting suspiciously with his quick claim to be a Villager and his eagerness to question others. I'm accusing Dragos of being a Werewolf.\n",

Dragos, you came out strong with your claim of being a Villager, and then you quickly shifted the attention to Alexandra when she accused you. You're acting a bit defensive.
