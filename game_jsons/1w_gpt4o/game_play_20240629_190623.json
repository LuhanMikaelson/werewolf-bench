Personally, I had a pretty uneventful night because I\u2019m just a regular Villager. But I think it's more critical to hear from special roles like Masons or the Seer right now, so we can gather more useful information. What makes you so sure you\u2019re a Villager, Stefan?

Viktor, you seem to be quite vocal and adamant about not providing much information on your role aside from claiming to be a Villager. I'm starting to think that maybe you're trying to deflect suspicion away from yourself by pushing it onto Stefan. To everyone here, this seems like classic Werewolf behavior to me.\n",
