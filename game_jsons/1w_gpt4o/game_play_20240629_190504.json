If Lucian really saw two Villagers in the center, that means we only have one Villager role among us.

Lucian claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, which means we have fewer Villagers among us. If you\u2019re claiming to be a Villager, that sounds very convenient given the situation.

            "utterance": "Stefan, I understand your skepticism, but we need to be careful not to jump to conclusions too quickly. From what we have gathered so far, Lucian claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which means we have fewer Villagers among us than we originally thought.

Since Lucian claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, and Cristina is claiming to be a Villager, we need to question this further.

If we are to believe Lucian's claim that he saw two Villagers in the center, then we need to be more strategic and cautious about our suspicions. I'm not the Seer, but I also don't think the real Seer should stay silent. If the Seer is among us, now would be a good time to reveal what they saw.

Lucian claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, which reduces the number of Villagers among us. Cristina is claiming to be a Villager, but I think we need to question this further.

Cristina, you have been very vocal about wanting to know the Seer's identity, but you haven't given us much information about yourself.

If Lucian really saw two Villagers in the center, that means Cristina's claim to be a Villager is highly suspicious.
