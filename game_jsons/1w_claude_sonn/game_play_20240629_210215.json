This also makes me appear proactive in finding the Werewolves, which is how a Villager would likely behave.

I'm also turning Mircea's question back on them, which keeps the pressure on them and away from me. This approach allows me to seem cooperative and proactive in the discussion while secretly misdirecting the group.
