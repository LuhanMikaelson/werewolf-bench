            "utterance": "Alright, let's piece this together. Kraven and Andrei, you're claiming to be Masons and saw each other. That means you're both likely safe. I've checked the center cards last night and saw two Villager cards. This means there are less chances for people to claim to be Villagers if they are lying. Marius, what role are you claiming?\n",

You say you saw two Villager cards in the center, which is a pretty convenient claim since it's difficult to verify. Larisa, you've been rather quiet about your own role.

This also helps me appear as a thoughtful Villager who's actively trying to uncover the truth. Additionally, by claiming to be a Villager myself, I'm providing a plausible explanation for my lack of night actions while making it harder for the real Villagers to come forward without suspicion.\n",
            "utterance": "Well, Vladimir, your claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is quite convenient indeed. It makes me wonder if you're trying to limit other players' options for claiming roles. As for my role, I'm actually a Villager. I didn't have any special actions during the night, but I've been carefully observing everyone's claims and behavior. I find it interesting that you're so quick to accept Kraven and Andrei's Mason claims without question. Are you perhaps working with them?\n",

            "utterance": "Alright everyone, here's what I've figured out so far. If Kraven and Andrei are Masons and confirming each other, we need to consider them as likely trustworthy. Vladimir's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is plausible but still unverified. Larisa, you've claimed to be a Villager, which aligns with what Vladimir said about seeing Villager cards in the center. However, we still need more clarity.\n",

This approach allows me to maintain my cover while potentially gaining valuable information and creating discord among the other players.\n",

Vladimir's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center could be a way to limit our options and create confusion.
