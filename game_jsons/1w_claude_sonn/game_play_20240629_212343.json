Cristina has been very vocal, which could either mean she's genuinely trying to help or she's trying to manipulate us.

I think Selene's reaction is actually quite normal, especially if you're innocent and someone suddenly accuses you without reason.

Additionally, by showing concern for finding 'actual clues,' I'm trying to appear as a helpful villager, further masking my true identity.\n",

Viktor, I appreciate your attempt to be rational, but I think you're misinterpreting my intentions. I'm not trying to manipulate anyone; I'm genuinely concerned about finding the werewolves.

Alexia, you asked if I noticed anything specific during the night phase that makes me distrust Cristina more than Selene.

Alexia, you've pointed out that both Cristina and I have been strategic in our responses. But let's not forget that Selene has been quite reserved and defensive.
