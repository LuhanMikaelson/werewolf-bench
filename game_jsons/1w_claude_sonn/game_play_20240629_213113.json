This also gives me an opportunity to gauge Dracula's reaction, which might help me identify if he's the Minion or a potential threat like the Seer.\n",
            "utterance": "Well, Viktor, to answer your question, I didn't notice anything particularly unusual last night. But I have to say, I'm a bit concerned about Dracula. He's been awfully quiet so far. Dracula, care to share what role you might have?\n",

This could potentially sow discord among the villagers and make them less likely to trust each other. Additionally, by asking for others' opinions, I'm deflecting attention away from myself and encouraging more discussion, which gives me more opportunities to observe and manipulate the group dynamics.\n",
