This all seems to add up, but we still have the issue of only one Villager being left among us. Lucian, earlier you claimed to be a Villager, but things aren't quite adding up. If there can only be one Villager among us, it could mean you're trying to hide something. Maybe you're the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf? Or worse, maybe you're the Werewolf yourself?
