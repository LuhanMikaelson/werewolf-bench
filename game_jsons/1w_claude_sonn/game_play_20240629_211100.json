This move also helps me identify potential allies - if anyone strongly defends Vladimir, they might be the Minion.\n",

By questioning Alexandra's motives and pointing out her sudden change in behavior, I'm attempting to cast doubt on her credibility. This serves multiple purposes: 1) It helps me maintain my facade as a concerned Villager. 2) It keeps the suspicion off me by presenting Alexandra as a potential threat. 3) It continues to sow discord among the other players, making it harder for them to identify the real Werewolf (me). Additionally, by bringing up Vladimir's inconsistent claim again, I'm subtly reinforcing the idea that he might be untrustworthy, which could be useful later if I need to deflect attention again.\n",

If anyone's been creating confusion, it's Vladimir with his inconsistent Seer claim. And now you're suddenly pointing fingers at me? That's awfully convenient. I think we need to consider the possibility that you might be the Werewolf trying to deflect attention.
