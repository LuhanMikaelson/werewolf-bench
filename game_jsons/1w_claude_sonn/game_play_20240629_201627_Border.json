First, it gives me a seemingly innocent role. Second, it puts pressure on Michael to either confirm or deny my claim, potentially causing confusion. If he denies it, I can argue that he might be lying to protect himself. If he confirms it, it might make others suspicious of both of us. This strategy also indirectly casts doubt on Cristina's Seer claim, as there can't be both a Seer and two Masons if Andrei is indeed a Villager.
