Selene, I'm not suspicious of Lucian and Emil confirming their roles quickly - that's what Masons do. I mentioned it earlier to ensure we're being thorough, but I believe them. What I'm more concerned about is why you're so focused on the Villager claims. Remember, there are three Villager cards in play, so it's entirely possible for both Dracula and me to be Villagers.

Mircea is claiming to be a Villager just like me and Selene, but let's not forget that Emil and Lucian have confirmed each other as Masons. If we assume that all three Villager claims are true, which is possible since there are three Villager cards, then one of us must be lying. And I'm starting to believe that person is Selene.
