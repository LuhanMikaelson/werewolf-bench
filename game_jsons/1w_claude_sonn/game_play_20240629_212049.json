By saying I didn't see another Mason, I'm implying that someone else might be lying about their role. Directing a question to Kraven, who hasn't spoken yet, puts pressure on him and takes attention away from me. This also helps me gather more information about the other players' claimed roles, which can help me identify potential threats like the Seer.\n",

This serves multiple purposes: it keeps suspicion away from me, potentially exposes Kraven's role (which could be useful information), and might make Kraven appear more suspicious to others. If Kraven claims to be a Villager or another role that's hard to verify, it could make my Mason claim seem more believable in comparison. Additionally, by emphasizing my 'vulnerability' as a lone Mason, I'm trying to garner sympathy and trust from the other players.\n",

The fact that I didn't see another Mason actually puts me in a vulnerable position, which is why I'm trying to gather information from everyone. I find it interesting that you're so quick to doubt me instead of sharing your own role. Are you perhaps trying to deflect attention from yourself?
