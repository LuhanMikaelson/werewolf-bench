If Emil agrees with me, it could further isolate Alexia, making her a potential target for elimination. If Emil disagrees, it could create tension between players, which is beneficial for me as a Werewolf. Additionally, by suggesting Alexia might be the Minion rather than a Werewolf, I'm indirectly protecting my potential ally while still casting doubt on her claims.\n",
