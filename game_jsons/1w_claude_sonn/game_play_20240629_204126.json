By questioning his claim, I'm attempting to undermine his credibility and potentially turn the group against him. This also serves to make me appear more analytical and villager-like, as I'm openly questioning information rather than accepting it blindly.\n",
            "utterance": "Hold on a second, Viktor. You're claiming to be the Seer? That's quite convenient, isn't it? I'm not entirely sure I believe you. If you're really the Seer, why would you reveal that information so quickly? It seems like you're trying to establish yourself as a trustworthy villager right off the bat, which is exactly what a Werewolf might do.\n",

Claiming to be a Mason is a good choice because it's a role that's difficult to disprove, and it allows me to introduce some doubt about the center cards. By saying I didn't see another Mason, I'm indirectly supporting Viktor's claim about the center cards, which might make me seem more trustworthy. However, I'm still maintaining my skepticism about Viktor to keep the focus on him rather than me. This approach allows me to appear cooperative while still sowing seeds of doubt and confusion, which is beneficial for the Werewolf team.\n",
            "utterance": "Well, Viktor, since you're asking, I'm actually one of the Masons. I woke up during the night and looked for my fellow Mason, but I didn't see anyone else. This leads me to believe that the other Mason card is in the center. Now, this information, combined with your claim about seeing the Minion and a Villager in the center, is quite interesting. If we're both telling the truth, then we know the contents of all three center cards. But that's a big 'if', isn't it? I'm still not entirely convinced by your Seer claim. What do the rest of you think about this?\n",

            "utterance": "Alright, here's what I'm thinking. If Viktor is telling the truth and he saw the Minion and a Villager in the center, that means there are no Minions in play. Dragos claimed to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which aligns with Viktor's statement. So, if both are telling the truth, we know the Minion and one Villager are in the center and the other Mason is also in the center. That leaves us with three Villagers and one Werewolf among the four of us here. We need to figure out who is lying.\n",

This strengthens the credibility of Viktor's Seer claim and reveals Dragos as the most suspicious. Alexandra's logic also supports this since if Viktor is being truthful, Dragos is our prime suspect.\n",
            "utterance": "Alright everyone, let's not beat around the bush. I'm one of the Masons and I know Alexia is the other Mason. This means Dragos is definitely lying about being a Mason. I'd say Dragos is the Werewolf trying to throw us off.\n",

            "utterance": "Alright, let's take a closer look at what's going on here. Dragos, your claim of being a Mason is directly contradicted by Alexia and Larisa, who both claim to be Masons and confirm each other's roles. Given that I've seen the Minion and a Villager in the center, it's highly unlikely that three people are lying about being Masons. Dragos, you're looking very suspicious right now.\n",

By suggesting that Larisa, Alexia, and Viktor might be working together, I'm trying to shift suspicion away from myself and onto them. This creates confusion and might make the other players hesitate before voting. It's a desperate move, but it's my best chance to survive and potentially win the game.\n",
            "utterance": "Wait a minute, everyone! I think we're all being too quick to jump to conclusions here. Larisa and Alexia, you two suddenly claiming to be Masons seems awfully convenient, doesn't it? It's almost as if you're working together to frame me. And Viktor, your Seer claim still doesn't sit right with me. How do we know you're not all working together as a Werewolf team?\n",

Both Alexia and Larisa have confirmed each other as Masons and Viktor's claim about the center cards aligns with their statements.

She's barely contributed anything substantial, only agreeing with others when pressed. That's exactly the kind of behavior a Werewolf would exhibit to avoid drawing attention to themselves.
