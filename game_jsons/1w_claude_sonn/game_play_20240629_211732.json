This could potentially lead to a misdirected vote later. 3) By mentioning the Minion, I'm subtly reminding others of this role's existence, which could create more chaos and confusion. 4) If Kraven is indeed the Minion, this accusation might make him defensive, potentially exposing himself or creating more discord among the players.
