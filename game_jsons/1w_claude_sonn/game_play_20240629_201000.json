That behavior seems more in line with what we'd expect from a Werewolf trying to gather information.

I didn't mention it earlier because, well, being a Villager isn't exactly exciting news, is it? But since you asked, I'll say it outright. Now, I find it interesting that you're so quick to turn the tables on me. Are you perhaps feeling cornered by Semira's observation about your analytical approach? It seems like you're trying to create confusion by accusing everyone who speaks up. That's classic Werewolf behavior, isn't it?\n",
