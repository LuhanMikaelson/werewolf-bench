There is a significant contradiction between Mircea and Semira's claims about being the Seer. Mircea's choice to look at two center cards instead of one player's card is suspicious and not typical Seer behavior. This, combined with the fact that it would indeed account for two Villagers in the center, makes Mircea's claim less credible. Given the conflicting statements and behaviors, Mircea is the most suspicious and likely to be the Werewolf or Minion.\n",

Mircea claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which matches Semira's claim about the Drunk card being in the center. This leaves no room for Alexia's Villager claim. Given that the Mason and Seer claims align and Alexia's claim is contradictory, it is most likely that Alexia is either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to blend in.
