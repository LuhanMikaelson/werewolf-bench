If Emil truly is the Seer, then we need to consider his information carefully. Alexandra, you've been quick to accuse Emil and Cristina without much else to offer. We need more transparency now.

Ileana has been very aggressive in questioning me but hasn't revealed her own role. Cristina claimed to be a Villager, which could be true, but Alexandra has been very quick to accuse me without much evidence. Michael, you've been quiet for too long. We need more transparency from everyone. Let's not forget, if the Seer is out there, now would be the perfect time to come forward and clear things up.
