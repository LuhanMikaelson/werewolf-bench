But here's another thought: if there are two Masons, one of which is in the center, it means Andrei's claim is truthful. In that case, there should only be one more Villager card in the center, aligning with Kraven, but leaving Emil's claim out. Now, why would Emil lie?

I claimed to have seen one Villager card in the center. Now, if we're to believe all these claims, it means there are a Mason and two Villager cards in the center.

If all these are true, it means there are no Werewolf cards in the center, which seems unlikely. Given the situation, I think it's more plausible that Kraven is lying to throw us off.

We have conflicting information about the center cards, which means someone is definitely lying. Andrei, you've been consistent with your Mason claim, and Kraven's statement supports your claim about the Mason card in the center. This makes Kraven's claim slightly more credible. However, Emil's claim to have seen one Villager card in the center is still questionable because the Seer typically looks at two cards. But let's not forget, it's possible that a Werewolf or even a Minion is trying to mix things up by pretending to be the Seer.

Kraven, you've backed this up by saying you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Emil, your claim of being a Seer and seeing one Villager card in the center is where things start to get muddy for me. Typically, a Seer looks at two cards to gather more information. If we're going to be methodical about this, Emil's choice to look at just one card seems off, and it doesn't align with how a Seer usually operates. It's possible Emil is trying to mislead us by pretending to be the Seer, which is a classic Werewolf move. Emil, if you're truly the Seer, why didn't you use your full ability?
