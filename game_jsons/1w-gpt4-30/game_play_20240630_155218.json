If Vladimir is claiming to be the Seer and saw two Mason cards in the center, and I am also claiming to be the Seer and saw the Drunk card in the center, there's a clear contradiction here. One of us is definitely lying. Now, if I were lying, why would I choose such a specific card like the Drunk? It would be risky for me to make such a claim if it could easily be disproven.
