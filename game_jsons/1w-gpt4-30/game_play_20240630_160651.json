This leaves us with a few possibilities: either someone here is the Minion, or someone is lying about their role entirely. Dragos, you've been relatively silent, and so far, only Vladimir has claimed to be a simple Villager. Before we make any hasty decisions, I think we need to hear more from Dragos.
