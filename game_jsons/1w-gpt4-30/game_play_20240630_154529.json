Viktor's claim about both Mason cards being in the center is pretty bold, but it's also a very convenient way to try to guide our suspicions away from him. If Viktor is telling the truth, that would mean he's the Seer and he saw the center cards. But if he's lying, he could very well be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf. We need to consider these possibilities carefully. Alexandra and I both claimed Villager, which is a safe claim but doesn't offer much information.
