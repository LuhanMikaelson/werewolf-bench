            "utterance": "Alright, I'll start this off. I am a Mason, and I didn't see another Mason wake up last night, which means one of the Mason cards is in the center. If there is a Seer among us, it would be great if you could share what you saw during the night.\n",

Now, Stefan claims to have seen a Villager in the center, reducing the number of Villager cards in play. If there's a Seer among us who hasn't spoken up, now would be a good time to confirm or dispute Stefan's claim.\n",

Stefan claims to be the Seer and saw a Villager card in the center, reducing the number of Villager cards in play. That leaves us with one less Villager and possibly one Mason. This means there are still a number of roles we haven't accounted for, including potentially a Werewolf and a Minion. Given this information, we need to be careful about any false claims.

Given Larisa's claim of being a Mason and Stefan's claim of being the Seer, my role doesn't have any special actions to confirm, but I can help us think this through. If there truly is only one Mason card in play and Stefan saw a Villager in the center, that leaves one more Villager, a Werewolf, and the Minion unaccounted for. Emil, it's crucial for you to share your role now to help us piece this puzzle together. We need to be very cautious because the Minion can be very tricky and might try to protect the Werewolf at all costs.\n",
