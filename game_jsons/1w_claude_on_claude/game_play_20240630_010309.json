By openly claiming the Seer role, I'm taking a risk, but it's necessary to establish trust and lead the discussion. I'm curious to see how others react to this information, which might give clues about their roles.\n",

I'm also subtly hinting at the possibility of a Werewolf having more information, which is true, but I'm framing it as a general concern rather than specific knowledge. This might make others less likely to trust Michael completely, while also giving me room to maneuver later if needed.\n",
            "utterance": "Interesting information, Michael. If what you're saying is true, that means we have a Werewolf, a Seer, and a Mason among us players, along with two Villagers. That's quite a mix! I'm a bit concerned though, because if there's only one Werewolf among us, they would have seen the other Werewolf card in the center and might have some additional information. We should be cautious about trusting anyone completely at this point.\n",

By questioning his strategy, I might be able to gauge his reaction and see if his story holds up under scrutiny. This also encourages other players to think critically about the information we're receiving.\n",
