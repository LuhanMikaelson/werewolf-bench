By directly questioning him, I can put pressure on him to explain and potentially reveal more information or inconsistencies.\n",

By questioning his certainty, I'm giving him a chance to backtrack if he's bluffing. If he stands firm, it introduces the possibility of card switching, which could explain the discrepancy without undermining my credibility as the Seer.

If you're truly the Mason and I'm telling the truth about seeing a Mason card in the center, there's only one explanation - your card must have been switched during the night. This points directly to the Werewolf's ability to look at and switch a center card. I think we should focus our attention on who might have had the opportunity to do this.
