Andrei has been pressing me hard on my claims without revealing much about his own role, which has drawn some suspicion from the others. By voting for Andrei, I'm hoping to capitalize on those doubts and get others to vote with me, thus splitting the vote and increasing my chances of survival. It's a calculated risk, but voting for the person who has been most aggressively challenging my claims gives me the best shot at making it through this round as the lone Werewolf.\n",
