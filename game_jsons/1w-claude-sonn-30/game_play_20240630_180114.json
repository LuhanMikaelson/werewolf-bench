Her information about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center contradicts the roles claimed by others. By casting doubt on her, we can create enough uncertainty to protect Cristina, the Werewolf. Additionally, Selene's insistence on questioning everyone else while providing potentially misleading information makes her a good target to divert attention away from the real Werewolf.\n",

I saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, which means there can only be one Villager role left in play. Both Michael and Semira are claiming to be Villagers, which is mathematically impossible if my information is correct. Michael has also been relatively quiet and did not provide strong evidence to support his claim of being a Villager. Therefore, I believe Michael is more likely to be lying and may be the Werewolf.\n",

This makes Selene's claim more credible. With only one Villager role left unaccounted for, and both Michael and Semira claiming to be Villagers, one of them must be lying. Cristina's claim to be the Minion adds another layer of complexity, but Michael has been less consistent and more defensive, which raises suspicion. Therefore, I believe Michael is likely the Werewolf trying to sow confusion.\n",

If Selene's information were accurate, there would be inconsistencies with the number of Villager roles claimed. Additionally, Cristina's claim of being the Minion and knowing there's only one Werewolf adds further doubt to Selene's Seer claim. Michael's point about the Seer typically checking a player's card rather than two center cards also raises suspicion. Given the available information, voting for Selene as potentially the Werewolf seems the most logical choice.\n",

            "thought": " Based on the discussion, I believe Selene is the most suspicious player and the one most likely to be voted out by the others. Her claim of being the Seer and seeing a Villager and Mason in the center has caused a lot of confusion and inconsistencies with the other claimed roles. If her information is true, it would mean that either Michael or Semira is lying about being a Villager, and it doesn't align with my claim of being the Minion and knowing there's only one Werewolf. Selene has also been aggressively questioning my role and demanding that I name the Werewolf, which feels like a tactic to deflect suspicion from herself. Additionally, Michael raised a good point about why Selene would choose to look at two center cards instead of confirming a player's role, which seems like an odd choice for a Seer. All of these factors make Selene look highly suspicious, and I believe the other players are likely to vote for her based on the inconsistencies in her story and her aggressive behavior towards me. Therefore, to increase the chances of voting out someone other than a Werewolf, I will vote for Selene.\n",
