Given that Lucian and I are confirmed Masons and can vouch for each other, the behavior of Mircea stands out as the most suspicious. Emil and Alexia have been vocal, but their suspicions align with the evidence of Mircea's evasiveness. To increase our chances of eliminating a Werewolf, voting for Mircea is the most logical choice.\n",
