This keeps the focus on Larisa while giving me a powerful role that the others are likely to trust. Agreeing with Vladimir's point about gathering more information makes me seem reasonable and open-minded, lowering suspicion on myself.

As the Seer, I looked at two of the center cards, hoping to gain some insight into what roles might be in play. Unfortunately, neither of the cards I saw were the Werewolf. So while I don't have definitive proof of Larisa's role, her defensive behavior still seems odd to me. An innocent player would be more focused on finding the Werewolf than just defending themselves.

It would be risky to claim seeing a particular role card, in case another player claims that role later. Keeping things vague preserves my credibility. Directing a question at Lucian puts someone else on the spot and pressures them to reveal information. Since Lucian has been quiet, he could be laying low to avoid suspicion.

Larisa claimed to be the sole Mason, which adds credibility to her role. Alexia's behavior seems more aligned with deflecting suspicion rather than genuinely finding the Werewolf. Given the roles in play, Alexia's behavior fits the profile of either a Werewolf or Minion trying to confuse us. Voting for Alexia seems the most logical choice to eliminate a potential threat.\n",

Larisa's claim of being the sole Mason and the information aligning with the known card distribution make her more credible. Therefore, Alexia is the most likely candidate to be hiding a sinister role, such as a Werewolf or the Minion.\n",
