By challenging her directly to provide a defense and appealing to Dracula to confirm my accusation, I'm putting the pressure back on her. If she can't come up with a convincing response and Dracula backs up my claim, it will make Ileana look even more suspicious to the others. This could seal her fate as the prime Werewolf suspect, allowing me to survive the vote and eliminate a village team member. By maintaining my Minion lie and keeping the focus on Ileana's evasiveness, I aim to further isolate her and make her the target, taking the heat off myself.\n",

If you're truly a Villager as you claim, why can't you provide a straightforward defense for yourself? I've been upfront about my role as the Minion from the very beginning. Dracula, as the Seer, can you please confirm whether you saw anything suspicious about Ileana's card during the night phase? Her evasive behavior and constant accusations against me are highly suspicious, and I firmly believe she's the Werewolf trying to mislead us all. I say we put it to a vote between Ileana and myself and let the village decide who they trust.\n",

This contradiction makes Marius's claim highly suspicious. Given that both Andrei and I are confirmed Masons, and Dracula's claim as the Seer aligns with our roles, it is more logical to suspect Marius as the Werewolf trying to create confusion. Ileana's logical reasoning and consistent defense align more with a Villager trying to figure things out rather than a Werewolf. Therefore, I believe Marius is the actual Werewolf.\n",
