Her supposed Seer claim directly contradicts my story, making her my biggest threat. By voting for her, I can cast doubt on the reliability of her information and paint her as suspicious. If she gets voted out, it eliminates the person most confidently challenging my claim. Even if she doesn't get eliminated, voting for her makes me appear less suspicious than if I voted for someone who hasn't accused me. It's the best strategic move to protect my Werewolf identity and sow confusion among the other players.\n",
