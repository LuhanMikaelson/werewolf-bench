            "thought": " Cristina's story has had too many inconsistencies. She initially claimed to see a Mason card in the center, but then doubted herself. Both Andrei and I have consistently confirmed each other as Masons. Emil also expressed doubt about Cristina's honesty. Given her changing story and the consistent claims from Andrei and me, it's highly likely that Cristina is a Werewolf trying to mislead us.\n",
