Additionally, Mircea's claim of being a Mason and reluctance to reveal the other Mason adds some ambiguity, but it is still a cautious strategy. Given the lack of concrete evidence and the uncertainty surrounding Marius's claim, I believe he might be a Werewolf trying to mislead us.\n",

If he were truly the Seer, verifying the center cards would provide more concrete information. His accusation seems more like a diversion.
