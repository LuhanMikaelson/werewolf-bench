            "thought": " Larisa's claim of seeing two Villagers in the center directly contradicts Selene's claim of seeing a Werewolf and a Villager. Given that Selene's account seems more consistent with the roles in play and Larisa's repeated insistence on her claim without providing additional convincing evidence, I suspect Larisa is either the Minion or a Werewolf trying to mislead us. Therefore, I believe targeting Larisa for elimination is the best course of action to increase our chances of winning.\n",
