            "thought": " I'm voting for Andrei because he has been the most aggressive in trying to discredit my claim of being the Seer and paint me as the Werewolf. His behavior has been very suspicious throughout the game. He waited to counterclaim me as the Seer until after I shared my information, which feels like he was trying to piggyback off what I said to make himself seem more credible. If Andrei was really the Seer, he should have spoken up right away. The fact that his claim conveniently aligns with Selene's information about the Masons makes me think they might be working together as Werewolves. Andrei has also been deflecting a lot of suspicion onto me and twisting my words to make me look guilty, which is exactly what a Werewolf would do to manipulate the group. I believe Andrei is lying about being the Seer to hide the fact that he's actually a Werewolf. By voting him out, we can expose his true identity and protect the Village team.\n",

            "thought": " As the Seer, I saw that the center cards included a Villager and a Mason, not a Werewolf. Radu's contradictory claim that he saw a Werewolf in the center is false. This indicates that he is either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf. His aggressive deflection and insistence on his story raises further suspicion. The most logical vote to eliminate the potential threat is Radu.\n",
