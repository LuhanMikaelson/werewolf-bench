His claim about seeing a Villager card in the center directly contradicts my own role as the Seer who saw the Drunk card. This inconsistency, along with his aggressive pushing for information, makes him appear untrustworthy. By voting for Radu, I increase the chances that the village will eliminate him instead of me. If Radu is not a Werewolf, voting him out will still be beneficial as it will lend credibility to my Seer claim and allow me to continue deceiving the village to protect my Werewolf identity.\n",

Michael also pointed out the contradiction and leaned towards Kraven\u2019s version being more credible. Given the information, it seems more likely that Radu is trying to mislead us and could be a Werewolf.\n",
