No, I revealed my role now because Larisa and Emil's accusations forced my hand. I had to share what I knew to prove my innocence and help the village. And I looked at Mircea's card instead of the center because I wanted to confirm my suspicions about him. His defensiveness and attempts to cast doubt on me only reinforce that he is indeed the Minion working with a Werewolf partner.

            "thought": " As the sole Werewolf, my best chance of survival is to vote for the player that the others are most likely to suspect. Throughout the discussions, I've consistently tried to paint Mircea as the Minion working with a Werewolf partner. By aggressively accusing him and calling out his evasive behavior, I've aimed to cast doubt on his role and make him the prime suspect. Larisa and Emil, as confirmed Masons, have been vocal in questioning Mircea's lack of transparency. Lucian has also expressed suspicion towards Mircea, despite his own evasiveness. Given the group's focus on Mircea and the pressure I've put on him, I believe the others are most likely to vote for him. By joining them in voting for Mircea, I can avoid drawing suspicion to myself and increase the chances of eliminating a Villager. This will bring me one step closer to victory as the sole Werewolf.\n",

            "thought": " Cristina's defensive behavior, the timing of her Seer claim, and her aggressive accusations make her the most suspicious. By claiming to be the Seer only after being accused, it seems like a calculated move to deflect suspicion. Both Larisa and I have confirmed Mason roles, and Mircea's evasiveness could be a reaction to Cristina's false claim. Lucian's silence adds some uncertainty, but Cristina's actions have consistently drawn the most suspicion. Therefore, voting for Cristina increases our chances of eliminating a potential Werewolf.\n",
