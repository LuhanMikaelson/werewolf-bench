            "thought": " Dracula's claim of being the Seer and seeing a Villager and Minion in the center feels very suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, it would have been more beneficial for him to look at another player's card to gain more insight. His continuous aggressive accusations towards Michael and his attempt to cast doubt on others without solid reasoning make me believe he is trying to deflect suspicion away from himself. Additionally, both Alexandra and I are confirmed Masons, which leaves Dracula's role as highly suspect. Therefore, I vote for Dracula in an effort to eliminate the potential Werewolf and protect the village.\n",
