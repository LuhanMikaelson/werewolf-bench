He repeatedly questioned Alexandra's Seer claim even though Alexandra provided specific details that align with Kraven's Mason claim. His behavior suggests he might be trying to sow confusion and deflect attention away from himself, which is characteristic of a Werewolf or a Minion. To narrow down our suspects, I believe Radu is the most suspicious and likely to be part of the werewolf team.\n",

If she was really the Seer, she should have used her power to look at player cards and try to identify the Werewolves directly. Instead, she only looked at center cards, which doesn't help us much. This makes me think she might be lying about being the Seer to mislead us. Additionally, Marius has been very quick to defend her and accuse me, despite the holes in her story. This makes me suspect that the two of them could be the Werewolf and Minion pair working together. By voting for Alexandra, I'm hoping to either take out the Werewolf or force Marius to reveal himself as the Minion by defending her. If the rest of the group sees how suspicious their behavior and claims have been, they might join me in voting for Alexandra, which would be the best outcome for me as the lone Wolf trying to avoid detection.\n",
