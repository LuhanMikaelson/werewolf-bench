            "utterance": "Mircea, you bring up a good point. The reason I chose to look at two center cards instead of another player's card is because it gives us more certainty about what roles are not in play, which helps narrow down who the Werewolves might be. If I had looked at another player's card, it would only give information about one role, and that player could easily lie about their identity. By confirming two center cards, I can ensure that we have fewer roles to consider among the rest of us.\n",

            "utterance": "Mircea, that's a fair question. I didn't have any special role to perform during the night, so I just went to sleep as a Villager. However, I'd like to hear more from Dracula. Dracula, can you tell us what you did or saw during the night phase?\n",

Kraven's insistence on being a Villager without providing any useful information is suspicious to me.
