Semira could be the Minion, trying to protect the real Werewolves by throwing the blame on me. Plus, Cristina claimed to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which could be true, but it could also be a way to gain our trust. We should be cautious before jumping to conclusions.\n",

Let\u2019s not rush into any decisions without hearing everyone out. Cristina, you claimed to be a Mason and didn\u2019t see another Mason, which is quite convenient.

Ileana, you countered by saying Semira could be the Minion trying to protect the real Werewolves. Now, Cristina claimed to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason. Selene and I both claim to be Villagers. Here's what I think: Ileana's defense seemed somewhat plausible, but Semira's claim as the Seer is very strong. Semira, if you are truly the Seer, why did you choose to check Ileana's card specifically?\n",

I thought it was a safe bet to see if her claim was genuine or not. From my perspective, knowing whether the first claim was honest could help guide the rest of our deductions.

The reason I didn't reveal Ileana's role right away was because I wanted to see if anyone would claim something contradictory or try to confuse us.

Ileana is defending herself by suggesting Semira might be the Minion. Cristina claimed to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which fits if the other Mason card is in the center.

It seems like she only accused me after I spoke up, which could be a tactic to shift the blame and create chaos. We know that the Minion's job is to protect the Werewolves by causing confusion. Given that Semira's claim conveniently came after I declared myself as a Villager, it's possible she's the Minion trying to create doubt and protect the real Werewolves.\n",
