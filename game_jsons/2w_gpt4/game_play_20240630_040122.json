With Stefan confirming that one Mason card is in the center, we know that at least one potentially suspicious role is out of the equation. But Emil, you've been deflecting quite a bit.

            "utterance": "Alright, Emil, I'll answer your question. I actually got a Villager role last night. But here's the thing, your insistence on questioning others without revealing your own role is quite suspicious. If you're truly on the village team, you should have nothing to hide.

Stefan has claimed to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, so we know one Mason card is in the center.
