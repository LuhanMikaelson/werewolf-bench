Do you have any information to share, or are you waiting for someone else to reveal something?\n",

            "utterance": "Alright everyone, here's my thought. Since Dragos has already claimed to be a Villager, and we're not getting much clarity from the others, I think it's time for the Masons to step forward and confirm each other. This way, we can either clear some people or start focusing our attention on others.\n",
