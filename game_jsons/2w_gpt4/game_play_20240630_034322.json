Dragos claims to be the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, but Semira says she is a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which means one Mason card must be in the center. If that's true, it makes Dragos' claim seem less credible. On top of that, Selene has been very evasive and hasn't contributed much to the discussion.
