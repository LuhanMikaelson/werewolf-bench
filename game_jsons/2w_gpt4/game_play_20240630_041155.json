I can tell you I'm just a regular Villager, so I didn't see anything during the night phase. But Radu, your certainty about the Mason card being in the center is a bit odd.

Sometimes certainty can be misleading in this game. Lucian, you're quick to ask for the Seer, which might be a smart move. But why so eager? If Marius is truly a Villager as he claims, we're dealing with three Villagers and one Mason here. We need to hear from everyone before jumping to conclusions.\n",

If Radu is indeed the Mason and one of the Mason cards is in the center, then that would mean there are no other Masons in play. But we still need to verify this information. Marius, you claim to be a Villager, so you didn\u2019t see anything during the night. But if Radu is lying, we might be dealing with a very crafty Werewolf or Minion here. Dragos, you seem to be taking a cautious approach, which is good. Michael, you're questioning my eagerness to hear from the Seer.

If Radu is indeed the Mason, it makes sense for a Seer to confirm this. But what if the Seer saw something else? Let's not forget, we have three Villagers in play.
