Since no one has claimed to be the Seer yet, and Semira immediately asked for the Seer to reveal themselves, it does make me a bit suspicious of her. But I'm also curious about Marius.

I think it's pretty clear that Semira is trying to manipulate the situation by pushing for the Seer to reveal themselves immediately.

            "utterance": "Alright, Viktor, since you've been pushing for me to reveal my role, I'm going to address you directly. To be transparent, I was dealt the Villager card. I think it's really important that we focus on getting information from everyone. Semira, you mentioned you're a Villager too, but we need more solid information. Did anyone here take a look at the center cards or have some concrete evidence from the night phase?\n",

But let's consider the possibility that Semira might be trying to manipulate us. If she were a Werewolf, getting the Seer to reveal themselves would be a strategic move. So, I'm putting it out there: Semira, you might be the Werewolf we're looking for.\n",

            "utterance": "Alright, everyone, it's clear that we're running in circles here. Viktor has been quite adamant about pushing for information from everyone else, which makes me suspicious. But let's also consider the fact that Semira was quick to request the Seer to reveal themselves. If Semira is really a Villager, wouldn't she be more cautious? I think Semira's behavior is too calculated and could very well be a Werewolf tactic to expose the Seer. We need to keep an eye on her.\n",

            "utterance": "Alright everyone, let's take a moment to think about this. So far, Semira has been very insistent on finding the Seer, which makes me think she might be trying to root out special roles to target. I'm still not convinced by her Villager claim.\n",
