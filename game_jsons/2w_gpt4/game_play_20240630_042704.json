This gives me time to gauge others' roles and potentially identify the Seer or other important Village roles.\n",

If they are indeed Masons, that helps us narrow down the potential Werewolves. However, if they're lying, we're in trouble. So, let's focus on what we know.

It aligns with my goal of casting doubt on others without drawing attention to myself.\n",
            "utterance": "Alright Alexia, I'll get to my role in a second, but first, I want to point out something. Mircea and Larisa claim to be Masons, which means they should have seen each other. If we trust them, that helps us focus on the remaining players. Now, Viktor's claim to be a Villager is pretty basic and common, but we can't rule it out just yet. So, let's consider our options carefully. Alexia, you've been asked about your role multiple times and have avoided answering. That makes me suspicious. Why are you being so evasive?\n",

Viktor has claimed to be a Villager, which is a common and easy role to fake. Andrei, you still haven't claimed a role yet, and that's making me suspicious. I think it's crucial we hear from you now.

However, Alexia, you've been dodging the question about your role, and that's making me very suspicious. We need transparency to make an informed decision.
