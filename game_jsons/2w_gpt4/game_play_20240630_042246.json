This could be a tactic to mislead us. Also, Mircea's claim as the Seer coincides with the center cards being Drunk and Villager, but let's not forget, these claims could be easily fabricated. Ileana, can you explain why you immediately backed Stefan's Mason claim without any hesitation?\n",

Stefan and Ileana both claimed to be Masons, which means they should know each other\u2019s roles. But the speed and coordination of their claims still seem a bit off to me. If they are both Masons, then they should have no problem with us verifying their claims. Also, Mircea's claim as the Seer aligns with the Drunk and Villager being in the center, but this could also be a convenient cover-up.

Mircea's claim of being the Seer and seeing the Drunk and Villager in the center seems convenient, but why would a Seer waste their ability on center cards instead of checking another player? That seems like a way to avoid real scrutiny. Andrei's claim of being a Villager is a safe move with no way to verify it. Stefan and Ileana's synchronized Mason claim could very well be a ploy to mislead us. We need to focus on the inconsistencies here. Personally, I believe Mircea's claim is the most suspicious.
