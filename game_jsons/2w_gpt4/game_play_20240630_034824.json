My best guess is that I'm just a plain Villager. But if anyone here is a Seer, it would be really helpful if they could come forward and share any information they might have gathered.

This also gives an opportunity for the Minion to potentially reveal themselves and help our team.\n",

I didn't wake up last night either, so I'm just a plain Villager. But let's not forget, the Minion knows who the Werewolves are and might be trying to mislead us. We need to be careful and think logically about this. Does anyone else have any concrete information to share? If we can get some claims out here, we might be able to piece things together.\n",

That leaves us with a few roles unaccounted for: the Seer, the Minion, and possibly Werewolves. If no one steps up to claim the Seer role soon, we might have to assume someone is hiding something.

Viktor, you've claimed to be a Villager, but I find it odd that you're so eager to point out the Minion as a potential threat when we haven't heard from any of the special roles yet.

            "utterance": "Radu, I understand your suspicion towards me. The reason I brought up the Minion is that they can be a very tricky role to deal with, especially when they know who the Werewolves are. But let\u2019s take a step back and analyze the situation carefully. You haven't revealed your role yet, which is making me a bit uneasy. If you're a Villager, Mason, or Seer, it would be helpful to know. Given that no one has claimed to be the Seer yet, maybe it's time for you to share what role you have.
