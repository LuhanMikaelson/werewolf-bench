If this is true, then we need to look closely at the remaining roles. Larisa and Dragos have both claimed to be Villagers, but that feels too convenient.

Andrei's sudden claim of being a Mason and calling Viktor the other Mason seems a bit too convenient. If they were really Masons, they should have been more upfront about it earlier. This late reveal raises some red flags for me. Larisa, who do you believe might be the Werewolves among us?\n",
