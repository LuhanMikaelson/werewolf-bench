But from what I'm hearing, Larisa claims there was no other Mason visible, meaning the other Mason card is in the center. That seems pretty solid information to me. However, Marius, you're really quick to jump on Alexia. Are you sure you're not trying to divert suspicion away from yourself?\n",

Andrei backed that up by saying he's just a Villager and didn't see any night actions. Marius and Alexia, you've both been very vocal about probing others but haven't revealed much about yourselves.
