I just wanted to get the discussion going and see if anyone who might have more conclusive information would step forward. As for me, I don't have any special information from the night phase, but I think it's important for us to be thorough and question things that might seem off.

We need to hear from the quieter players like Marius to get a better understanding of the situation.\n",

            "utterance": "Alright everyone, I think Mircea might be trying to deflect attention away from himself by claiming Villager so quickly. It's a common tactic for Werewolves to hide behind the Villager role since it doesn't have any special abilities. We need to be cautious about this.\n",

But what really catches my eye is Alexia's behavior. She has been directing the conversation heavily without giving away any information about her role.
