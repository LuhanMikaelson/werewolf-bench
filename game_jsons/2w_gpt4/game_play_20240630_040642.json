By pointing out the absence of a Seer claim, I can subtly suggest that someone might be lying without directly accusing anyone, which helps to sow confusion and divert attention from myself and Larisa.\n",
            "utterance": "Alright everyone, we need to start sharing our information. I'll go first. I'm just a simple Villager, so I didn't see anything last night.

That could mean a few things: either the Seer is being very cautious, or the Seer card might actually be in the center. But let's not forget, there's also a Minion among us who might be trying to sow confusion. So, considering the lack of information from a Seer, I think it's important we start by focusing on players who haven't given any useful information yet. Semira, you've been quiet.

It's important for all of us to share what we know so we can piece together what happened last night. Since no one else seems to want to step up, I'll share my role: I'm just a Villager. I didn't see anything last night, but I'm eager to hear from the rest of you. Let's get the information flowing so we can find those Werewolves!\n",

Since both Ileana and Larisa have claimed to be Villagers, and still no one is stepping up as the Seer or Mason, I'm getting suspicious. It feels like someone is holding back crucial information, and that could be dangerous for us. We need to hear from everyone, especially those who have been quiet so far.\n",

Based on the fact that no one has claimed to be the Seer or a Mason yet, and considering how Semira and Larisa have both been deflecting a lot, I'm starting to get suspicious of them.
