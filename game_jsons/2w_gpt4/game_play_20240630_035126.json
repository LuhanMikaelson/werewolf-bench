He's the one who claimed to be a Mason without any way for us to verify it. Also, he didn't see another Mason, which could mean he's lying or trying to mislead us.

            "utterance": "Alright, everyone, here's my thought. If Michael is indeed a Mason and didn't see another Mason, it means that the other Mason card is in the center. Lucian's push for the Seer to reveal themselves early on still feels off to me. It could be a ploy to expose the Seer and make it easier for the Werewolves.

However, Alexandra's aggressive questioning and refusal to reveal her role is still highly suspicious. It's almost like she's trying to gather information for some ulterior motive.
