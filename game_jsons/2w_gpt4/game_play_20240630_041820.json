            "utterance": "Alright everyone, let's clear things up a bit here. Dragos claims to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. I can confirm that there should only be one Mason because I am the Mason! So, Dragos's information checks out in that regard.

It seems a bit too convenient for you to just confirm Dragos's claim after the fact. I'm starting to think you might be the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf.
