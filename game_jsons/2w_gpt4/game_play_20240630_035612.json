Claiming to be the Seer and saying you saw the Minion and Villager in the center allows you to avoid scrutinizing any specific player. This could be a strategic move to stay under the radar.

This narrows down the roles significantly, especially since we're looking for Werewolves. So, Vladimir, did you wake up last night? If so, what did you see?\n",

If Ileana is telling the truth about seeing the Minion and a Villager in the center, then that helps us narrow down the roles significantly.
