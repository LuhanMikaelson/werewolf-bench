During the night, I had a chance to see two of the center cards, and both of them were Villagers.

If that's true, then it could mean we have a higher chance of identifying the Werewolves among the rest of us. I find it a bit suspicious that Vladimir was so quick to accuse Alexia without much evidence. That could be a classic Werewolf move to deflect attention.

            "utterance": "Larisa, that's a fair question. I understand that my initial accusation might have seemed hasty, but I was trying to get the conversation started and see how Alexia would react. It's important for us to ask direct questions and get everyone talking to uncover any inconsistencies. Now, Dracula, you haven't said much. What role did you have last night?\n",

Vladimir claims he's a Villager, which contradicts Selene's information. If Selene is telling the truth, Vladimir is lying, but if Vladimir is being honest, that makes Selene's claim suspicious.

If Selene is lying, she could be a Werewolf trying to throw us off. I find it interesting that Dracula hasn't shared his role clearly yet either. Based on all of this, I think it's more likely that Selene is the one trying to deceive us. I believe Selene is a Werewolf!\n",

Let's not forget that Dracula has been quite quiet, which could also be a deliberate tactic. So, I propose we take a closer look at Selene's claim and see if it holds up under pressure.\n",
