            "utterance": "Andrei, I chose to look at the center cards because they provide a broader overview of the roles that are not in play. Seeing two Villagers in the center helps us narrow down the possibilities and identify false claims more effectively. For example, if someone claims to be a Villager, we know that there are fewer Villager cards available and can scrutinize that claim more closely.\n",

Viktor claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, which means there are fewer Villagers among us. Dracula claims to be the remaining Villager, but that sounds a bit too convenient. Given the odds, it's more likely that the remaining roles are something other than Villager. Dracula might be trying to blend in too easily.\n",

Viktor has claimed to have seen two Villagers in the center, and Dracula has conveniently claimed to be the remaining Villager. This is a bit too convenient for my taste, especially since we know there are other roles in play that haven't been mentioned yet. If there are indeed two Villagers in the center, Dracula's claim seems suspicious. We need to consider the possibility that Dracula is trying to blend in by claiming the last Villager spot. Given this, I think we should focus our scrutiny on Dracula and see if his story holds up.\n",

I'm not convinced by your claim at all. If you're trying to blend in, it seems too obvious. If we go by the logic Viktor presented, there's a good chance you're not a Villager at all.

Viktor claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which would make Dracula's claim to be the remaining Villager quite suspicious.
