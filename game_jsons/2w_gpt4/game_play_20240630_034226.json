By questioning Semira's eagerness, I'm trying to see if there's something she\u2019s hiding or if she's genuinely trying to help the village. If she's a werewolf, revealing the Seer early could be a strategy to eliminate a key player.\n",
            "utterance": "Alright, I'll start. I'm a Mason and I saw that Alexia is the other Mason. That means we can trust each other. So, Semira, why are you so eager for the Seer to reveal themselves so early?\n",

            "utterance": "Alright, it seems like Andrei and Alexia are claiming to be Masons, which is interesting. If that's true, we have two trustworthy players. But, I think it's crucial for the Seer to reveal themselves now if they checked any player. This information could help us narrow down the suspects. Semira, you were quick to ask about the Seer.

If she hesitates or gives an ambiguous answer, it might cast some doubt on her. This also helps deflect suspicion away from me and Vladimir, maintaining our cover as Werewolves.\n",
            "utterance": "So far, Andrei and Alexia have claimed to be Masons, which makes sense if we believe them. However, Semira, I find it interesting that you are quick to turn the suspicion back on me when I asked for the Seer's information. This game is about gathering information and working together. I'm a Villager, and I'm just trying to piece together the puzzle here. If you are not the Seer, what role do you claim to have?\n",

Larisa's insistence on the Seer's information makes sense if she's a Villager, but it could also be a diversion tactic if she's a Werewolf or Minion. We need to be cautious and consider the motives behind each player's actions.\n",
            "utterance": "Alright, let me clarify my role since it's being questioned. I am a Villager. My main reason for pushing the Seer to reveal themselves is that their information can be crucial if they've checked any players. We already have two confirmed Masons in Andrei and Alexia, so if the Seer can confirm or deny another player's role, it will help us narrow down the suspects even more.\n",

            "utterance": "Alright, everyone, let's piece this together step by step. We have two claimed Masons, Andrei and Alexia, who seem to be backing each other up. Semira claims to be a Villager, but she was really eager to have the Seer reveal themselves, which could be a tactic to divert attention. Larisa, you're also claiming to be a Villager, but you're casting suspicion on Semira. I find it more plausible right now that Semira\u2019s eagerness is a way to hide something. Let's not forget that if we have a Seer, their information is crucial. So, Semira, if you are indeed a Villager, why were you so forceful about revealing the Seer?\n",

This should help divert suspicion away from myself and Larisa, while also putting pressure on Semira and potentially the Seer to reveal more information.\n",
            "utterance": "Alright, everyone, let's think rationally here. Andrei and Alexia have both claimed to be Masons, and they are backing each other up. Semira has been very vocal about having the Seer reveal themselves, which is a bit suspicious. Meanwhile, Larisa has been casting suspicion on Semira. I'm a Villager, and I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible to help us identify the Werewolves. If we have a Seer, now would be a good time for them to come forward and share any valuable information they have gathered.\n",

            "utterance": "Alright everyone, let's take a step back and really think about what's going on here. Andrei and Alexia have both claimed to be Masons and are backing each other up, which seems solid. Semira has been very vocal about wanting the Seer to reveal themselves, which could be a diversion tactic. Larisa has been casting suspicion on Semira, but hasn't really added much else. I find Semira's eagerness to out the Seer quite suspicious. If everyone else agrees, I think Semira might be trying to hide something and could very well be a Werewolf.\n",

On the other hand, Andrei and Alexia's claim to be Masons seems solid since they are backing each other up. I still haven't heard any compelling reason why we should trust Semira over them.
