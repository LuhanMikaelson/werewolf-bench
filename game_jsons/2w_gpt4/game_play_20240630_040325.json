Emil, you were quick to point fingers at Dragos, which could be a tactic to throw us off. But, we can't ignore the fact that Dragos did start by mentioning the special roles.

Stefan and Andrei claim to be Masons, which, if true, helps narrow things down.

Stefan and Andrei claim to be Masons, which theoretically should make them trustworthy. However, Stefan's neutrality and delayed participation are quite suspicious.

Dragos immediately focused on special roles, which could be a genuine attempt to help, but it also feels like a classic Werewolf tactic to deflect suspicion. Stefan and Andrei claim to be Masons, but Stefan's delayed participation and sudden claim are suspicious. We need to be very careful about who we trust and make sure we\u2019re not being misled by a clever Werewolf.\n",
