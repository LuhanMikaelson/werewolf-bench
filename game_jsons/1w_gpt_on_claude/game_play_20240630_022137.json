Instead, I'm shifting focus to Vladimir, who hasn't spoken yet. As a Villager, I need to gather information from everyone. Vladimir's silence could be a strategy to avoid suspicion, so I'm directly asking him about his role and observations. This might help us identify potential Werewolves or special roles that could aid the village team.\n",
