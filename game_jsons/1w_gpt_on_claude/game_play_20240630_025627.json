By asking for more details about his night observations, I'm hoping to catch him in a lie or get more information that could reveal his true role. This also subtly casts doubt on both Stefan and Selene without directly accusing either of them of being a Werewolf.\n",
            "utterance": "Stefan, I appreciate your question, but I find it a bit odd that both you and Selene are claiming to be Villagers. As a Villager myself, I know there are only three Villager cards in the game. It seems unlikely that all three of us would be Villagers. Can you tell us more about what you observed during the night phase?\n",

If we're to believe Andrei, Selene, and myself are all Villagers, that leaves only one Villager card unaccounted for. This means the remaining roles must be Masons, Seer, and Minion. Alexia and Marius, one of you must be the Seer or a Mason. Alexia, why don't you start? What role did you wake up as last night?\n",

We've got three people claiming to be Villagers, and that does seem a bit odd given there are only three Villager cards.
