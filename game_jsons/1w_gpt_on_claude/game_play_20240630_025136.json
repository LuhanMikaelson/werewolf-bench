Marius and Emil's bickering is exactly what the Werewolves want - it distracts us from finding the real threat.

We need to focus on finding who the Seer or Masons are so they can help us identify the Werewolves.

Additionally, by suggesting that wanting to find the Seer and Masons is suspicious, I'm discouraging the group from actually identifying these roles, which would be detrimental to the Werewolf team.\n",
