This also gives Andrei an opportunity to distance himself from me, which could help maintain our cover. Additionally, by targeting Vladimir, I'm hoping to identify whether he might be the Seer or a Mason, which would make him a prime target for elimination.\n",
            "utterance": "Well, well, well... This is certainly getting interesting. I woke up as a Villager, and I have to say, I'm quite concerned about the accusations flying around.

I woke up as a Villager, and I've been trying to piece together all the information we've got. Andrei, you're claiming to be a Villager, and Viktor, you're also claiming to be a Villager. This is interesting because statistically, we should have a mix of roles here. Mircea, you haven't really been questioned thoroughly. I think it's time you share more about your role.
