That seems like a classic deflection tactic to me. Ileana, why don't you tell us what role you woke up with?

However, I find it interesting how Ileana has been very quick to accuse Mircea without much to back it up. Ileana, you've been deflecting and not really contributing much to the discussion. If you had a role that could help us, why haven't you shared it yet? I strongly suspect that Ileana might be hiding something and could be one of the Werewolves.\n",
