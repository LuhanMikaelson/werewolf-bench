This approach allows me to appear proactive and helpful to the village while secretly working against their interests.\n",

As someone who's played this game quite a few times, I've noticed that Werewolves often try to blend in by claiming to be Villagers. It's an easy role to claim without much scrutiny. I'm actually a Mason, and I didn't see another Mason during the night phase. This means the other Mason card is likely in the center. Cristina, you seemed eager to find the Seer.

Now, regarding suspicions, I'm actually quite concerned about you, Cristina. You haven't revealed your role yet, and you seem very keen on exposing others.

Now, you've been relentlessly pushing to find the Seer and deflecting attention onto others when questioned. That's classic Werewolf behavior.
