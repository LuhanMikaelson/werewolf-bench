If she's a Mason or the Seer, her answer might give that away. 3) I'm positioning myself as a concerned villager trying to uncover the truth, which helps deflect suspicion from me. 4) By asking about Michael's behavior specifically, I'm subtly reinforcing the idea that he might be a Werewolf, without making it seem like I'm on a witch hunt.
