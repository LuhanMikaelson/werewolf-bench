You've been deflecting questions and haven't given us any information about your role. If Kraven and Andrei are indeed Masons, that leaves you, me, and Michael. And I know I'm not a Werewolf, so that narrows things down quite a bit, doesn't it? Care to share your role with us, Semira? Or are you the one with something to hide?\n",
