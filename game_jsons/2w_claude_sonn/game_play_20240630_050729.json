By claiming to be a Villager, I'm taking on a neutral role that's hard to disprove.

This could help identify targets for the Werewolf team to vote for later. Additionally, by engaging actively in the discussion, I'm trying to appear as a helpful Villager rather than a silent, suspicious Werewolf.\n",

I've been observing everyone's reactions carefully, and I have to say, Ileana's quick accusation of Viktor seems a bit hasty. Ileana, are you sure you're a Mason?

This also makes me appear proactive and interested in uncovering the truth, which is how a Villager might act. Additionally, by targeting Alexandra, I'm indirectly suggesting that I'm not associated with her, further distancing myself from suspicion. If Alexandra claims a role that can't be easily verified (like Villager or Minion), it will be harder for the others to prove she's a Werewolf. This move also takes some pressure off Viktor, who's already under suspicion, potentially preserving a Villager who could be a useful scapegoat later.\n",
