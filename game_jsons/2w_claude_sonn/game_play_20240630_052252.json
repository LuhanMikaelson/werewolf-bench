This also serves to sow confusion among the Villagers, making it harder for them to identify the real threats. Additionally, by asking for others' opinions, I'm trying to appear collaborative and part of the village team, further masking my true identity.\n",

            "utterance": "Vladimir, I appreciate your concern, but I think you're barking up the wrong tree here. I've been quiet because I've been trying to piece together all the information we have. To be honest, I'm a Villager. I know it's not the most exciting role, but it's crucial for us to work together to find the real threats. Now, I'm more interested in why you're so quick to deflect attention onto others. Are you perhaps trying to hide something yourself?\n",

Michael, if you're truly the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center, then that leaves us with fewer roles to account for among the players here.

By claiming to be a Villager, I align myself with Cristina's claim, making us both seem more credible. Questioning Lucian serves two purposes: it diverts attention away from me and potentially identifies a target for elimination. If Lucian turns out to be the Seer or a Mason, he would be a prime target for the Werewolves. Additionally, by expressing surprise at Vladimir's interest in my role, I subtly cast doubt on him as well, further muddying the waters.\n",
            "utterance": "I must say, I'm quite surprised by the turn this conversation has taken. Vladimir, your sudden interest in my role seems rather suspicious. Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself? As for my role, I'm a simple Villager, just like Cristina. But I find it interesting that no one has questioned Lucian's role yet.

Cristina and Dragos both claimed to be Villagers, which seems a bit too convenient. We need to be cautious of too many Villager claims. Vladimir, you still haven't answered what role you had last night. If you're hiding something, now's the time to come clean.\n",

Lucian was quick to cast doubt on Michael's Seer claim without giving us much about his own role. Cristina's Villager claim seems safe, but she says she's trying to piece things together. Dragos also claims to be a Villager. Michael, if you truly are the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center, then it's possible someone here is lying. Given the limited roles in play, I find it hard to believe both Cristina and Dragos are Villagers. One of them is likely hiding something.\n",
