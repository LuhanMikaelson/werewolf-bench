If Larisa truly saw a Villager and a Minion in the center, it means both those roles are not in play among us. This information is crucial and aligns with my suspicions. Given Ileana's aggressive approach and the lack of concrete evidence against me, I'm even more convinced that Ileana might be trying to sow confusion and deflect attention.
