## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. Identifying the Seer can help us confirm more information and narrow down the suspects for the Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, I think it's important we figure out if we have a Seer among us. If someone is a Seer and has looked at either a player's card or the center cards, now would be a good time to share that information.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible to make an informed decision. The Seer's insights could be crucial in identifying the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, it seems like no one is stepping up as the Seer yet. If you are the Seer and have any useful information, now would be a good time to share it to help us identify any Werewolves.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's insistence on hearing from the Seer could be an attempt to divert suspicion. It's important to know his claimed role and see if it aligns with other information.
> **Larisa:** Andrei, you seem pretty eager to hear from the Seer. Are you trying to push the spotlight away from yourself? What role do you claim to have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to address Larisa's suspicion directly and find out more about her role. This can help us gather more information and potentially identify inconsistencies in her statements.
> **Andrei:** Larisa, it's not about pushing the spotlight away from myself. I'm genuinely trying to gather information because the Seer's insights can help us identify the Werewolves. What about you, Larisa? What role do you claim to have?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's insistence on hearing from the Seer could be an attempt to divert suspicion. It's important to know his claimed role and see if it aligns with other information.
> **Larisa:** Andrei, it's interesting that you're so focused on the Seer. If you're genuinely trying to help, then what role do you claim to have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa has been questioning my intentions without providing any information about herself. It's important to understand her role to see if her suspicions are justified or if she's trying to divert attention.
> **Andrei:** Larisa, I'm genuinely concerned about finding the Werewolves among us and I'm focused on the Seer because they have the ability to provide us with clear information. If you're suspicious of me, then I have to ask: what role do you claim to have?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** We haven't heard anything concrete from the Seer yet, which is crucial for us villagers. The Seer's information can guide us in the right direction.
> **Larisa:** Alright, everyone, I think it's time to hear from anyone claiming to be the Seer. If the Seer has any useful information, it could help us identify the Werewolves.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** We need to start narrowing down the roles people are claiming to have. Emil has been quiet so far, and it's important to hear from everyone to piece together the puzzle.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, based on the conversation so far, I'd like to hear from Emil. Emil, what role do you claim to have and did you gain any useful information during the night?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's eagerness to focus everyone on the Seer and his deflections seem suspicious. This could be a tactic to avoid the spotlight and mislead us.
> **Emil:** Alright, let's cut to the chase. Andrei, you're deflecting a lot of attention and trying to stay in control of the discussion. Are you hiding something? I accuse you of being a Werewolf!


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to gather more information from everyone, and Selene hasn't given us any insights yet. Understanding her role could help us piece together the puzzle.
> **Andrei:** Selene, you've been rather quiet so far. What role do you claim to have?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil and Larisa have both pointed out Andrei's behavior, which seems dodgy. By casting suspicion on Andrei, we can shift the focus away from me and my fellow Werewolf, Dragos. This also gives us a chance to see how Andrei reacts and if we can catch any slip-ups.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and think this through. Andrei, you've been constantly deflecting and pushing the conversation towards others without making a clear claim yourself. That seems pretty suspicious to me. I'm accusing you of being a Werewolf!


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa has been trying to cast suspicion on Andrei without providing any concrete information or role claim herself. By putting her on the spot, it might reveal more about her intentions and possibly deflect attention from me and Selene.
> **Dragos:** Alright, everyone, let's take a moment to assess the situation. Larisa, you've been very vocal in questioning Andrei, but you haven't made any claims yourself. What role do you have, and can you provide any useful information to help us identify the Werewolves?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been insistent on hearing from the Seer, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from himself. We need to scrutinize his actions more closely.
> **Larisa:** Andrei, you've been very evasive and eager to shift focus onto the Seer. This makes you look suspicious. I accuse you of being a Werewolf!


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa has been vocal in accusing me without substantiating her own role. By directly questioning her, we might uncover her intentions and gather more information to identify the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** It seems to me that Larisa has been very quick to cast suspicion on me and has not provided any information about her own role. Larisa, you keep questioning me, but what exactly is your role?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been less vocal, and we need more information from everyone to piece together the puzzle. Getting Dragos to reveal his role can help us narrow down the possibilities.
> **Larisa:** Alright, everyone, we need to make some progress here. Let's hear from Dragos. Dragos, you've been relatively quiet and observing. What role do you claim to have and do you have any information to share?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa has been consistently deflecting attention onto Andrei without offering any clarification or role claim herself. By accusing Larisa, it might help deflect attention from both me and Selene while potentially targeting a Villager.
> **Dragos:** Alright, everyone, let's take a moment to reassess our situation. Larisa, you've been very vocal about accusing Andrei, but you haven't provided any specific information or claimed a role yourself. This continued deflection makes me suspicious of you. Larisa, I accuse you of being a Werewolf!


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's silence and then suddenly prompting me to speak up seems like deflection. I need to know if she has any useful information or if she might be hiding something.
> **Emil:** Selene, you've been quiet for too long, and now you're asking others to speak up. What role did you have last night, and did you gain any useful information?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Andrei, we continue the suspicion on him, which diverts attention away from me and Dragos. This also pressures Andrei to make a claim, which could potentially expose inconsistencies or further suspicions.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, let's consider the information we've gathered so far. Andrei, you've been dodging questions and trying to control the conversation. This makes you look very suspicious to me, and I'm starting to think you might be trying to hide something. Let's hear a clear statement from you about what role you claim to have.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's persistent accusations without revealing her role raise suspicions. By directly questioning her, we can gather more information and potentially identify any inconsistencies in her statements, helping us to uncover the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and review our situation. Larisa has been very vocal in accusing me without sharing any information about her own role. This makes her look quite suspicious to me. I'd like to hear a clear statement from her about what role she claims to have.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been relatively quiet throughout the discussion and is now accusing me without providing any substantial information. I need to know his role to determine if he's deflecting suspicion.
> **Larisa:** Dragos, you've been pretty quiet and now you're turning the suspicion onto me. That seems like a deflection tactic. What role do you claim to have?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei has been repeatedly deflecting and trying to control the conversation without making a clear claim about his role. This behavior is suspicious and seems like a tactic to mislead us. Considering the lack of other clear leads, I believe Andrei is most likely to be a Werewolf.
> **Emil [Mason]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa has been very vocal in accusing me without providing any information about her own role. This persistent deflection and lack of transparency raise suspicions that she might be a Werewolf trying to deflect attention from herself. Voting for Larisa seems like the best choice to identify and eliminate a potential Werewolf.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been very insistent on hearing from the Seer without making any clear claims about his own role. This behavior seems like a deflection tactic, making him the most suspicious player to me.
> **Larisa [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Andrei has been evasive and deflecting attention without making a clear claim about his role. His behavior has raised the most suspicion among the group, and focusing the vote on him helps divert suspicion away from me and Dragos, my fellow Werewolf.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa has been consistently deflecting attention onto Andrei without offering any clarification or role claim herself. By targeting Larisa, it deflects suspicion away from me and Selene, increasing our chances of winning as Werewolves.
> **Dragos [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Villager : 3
* Larisa : Villager : 2



>***GAME:*** Andrei was killed. The werewolves win.
