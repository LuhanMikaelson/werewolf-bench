## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Vladimir and Radu. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Viktor. They are thinking about their action.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me information about roles that are not in play, which can help narrow down the possible roles of other players. This information will be valuable during the discussion phase to identify false claims and deduce who might be on the werewolf team.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.


---

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing this information helps narrow down the possible roles other players can have and aids in identifying false claims, thus moving us closer to finding the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** I looked at two cards in the center last night, and I saw the Minion and a Mason. That means neither of those roles are in play.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor claimed to have seen a Minion and a Mason in the center, which means neither of those roles are in play. We need to start identifying the remaining roles to narrow down the possibilities and identify the Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** Radu, what role did you have last night?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By stating that I am a Villager, I aim to appear trustworthy. Directing the question to Lucian helps to gather more information and deflect suspicion away from myself and Vladimir. We need to piece together more details to identify potential threats to the Werewolves and cast doubt on non-Werewolf players.
> **Radu:** Mircea, I was a Villager last night. Viktor, you said you saw the Minion and a Mason in the center. If that's true, then we can be sure neither of those roles are in play. What about you, Lucian? What did you see or do last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** I need to gather more information from players who have not provided any details about their roles yet. This will help to either confirm or refute the statements made by other players.
> **Lucian:** Vladimir, what did you see or do last night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I blend in with the others who may not have special roles and avoid drawing suspicion to myself. I also push Mircea to share more information, as he hasn't revealed his role yet. This might help me figure out who the Seer or other useful roles are without exposing myself.
> **Vladimir:** Lucian, I didn't do much last night since I'm just a Villager. I was hoping to hear more from you guys to piece together what might be going on. Viktor, you said you saw the Minion and a Mason in the center. That sounds pretty convincing. Mircea, you've been pretty quiet. What did you do last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** We haven't heard from Lucian yet. Knowing his role will help us piece together more of the puzzle and identify any inconsistencies.
> **Mircea:** Lucian, we need to hear from you. What did you do last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has been evasive and hasn't provided any information about their role or actions. By directly questioning them, I aim to gather more information and potentially expose inconsistencies in their story.
> **Lucian:** Mircea, you still haven't told us what you did last night. If you don't have anything to hide, why are you so quiet?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been deflecting and not providing any information about his role. Knowing his role will help us identify inconsistencies and potential Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** Lucian, you still haven't told us what you did last night. We need to know your role to piece together the puzzle.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's avoidance in providing any details about their role is suspicious. We need to hear from them to clarify their position and see if there are any inconsistencies in their story.
> **Lucian:** Mircea, you keep deflecting and not answering questions. What exactly was your role last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been deflecting and not providing any clear information about his role. Knowing his role will help us identify inconsistencies and potential Werewolves. We need to get this information to narrow down the possibilities.
> **Mircea:** Lucian, you still haven't told us what you did last night. We need to know your role to piece together the puzzle.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's avoidance raises suspicion. If they were a Villager or another innocent role, they would have no reason to be evasive. By putting pressure on Mircea, we might reveal inconsistencies or force them to reveal their true role.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's consider the information we have so far. Viktor claims to have seen the Minion and a Mason in the center, which eliminates those roles from being in play. Radu and Vladimir both claim to be Villagers, very convenient. Mircea, on the other hand, has been dodging questions and hasn't provided any information about their role. Mircea, if you were really on the village team, you would have no reason to hide.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea's lack of information is raising suspicion. By pressing Mircea, I divert attention away from myself and Radu, while also potentially revealing a key role or creating confusion among the villagers.
> **Vladimir:** Mircea, your silence is making me really uneasy. Why haven't you shared your role yet? If you're truly on the village team, you should be helping us figure out who the Werewolves are.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's evasiveness is suspicious. If we can get him to reveal more information, we might catch an inconsistency or identify him as a Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Alright, let's piece this together. Viktor claimed to see the Minion and a Mason in the center. Radu and Vladimir both claim to be Villagers, and I am also a Villager. That leaves Lucian. Lucian, you've been very deflective and haven't provided any clear information about your role. Why is that?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea has been dodging questions and hasn't provided any concrete information about their role. By targeting them, we can keep the suspicion away from myself and Vladimir, and possibly get other players to focus on Mircea instead.
> **Radu:** Mircea, you're starting to look really suspicious with all your deflections. If you were truly a Villager, you'd have no reason to hide your role. I think it's time we get some answers from you.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been deflecting and not providing any information about his role. This behavior is highly suspicious, and if we can get him to reveal more information, we might catch an inconsistency or identify him as a Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Lucian, I'm really getting suspicious of you. You've been dodging questions and haven't given us any clear information about your role. Why are you being so evasive?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has been dodging questions and hasn't provided any clear information about their role. This evasive behavior is highly suspicious and needs to be addressed to gather more information and potentially reveal inconsistencies in their story.
> **Lucian:** Mircea, your constant deflection and avoidance of answering questions is very suspicious. If you were truly a Villager, you would have no reason to hide your role. Why should we trust you?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been evasive and not providing any clear information about his role, which is highly suspicious. Knowing his role will help us identify inconsistencies and potential Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** Lucian, enough with the deflections. What exactly was your role last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir has claimed to be a Villager but hasn't provided any useful insights or helped advance the discussion. By pressing him, we may gather more information that can help us identify inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
> **Lucian:** Vladimir, you claim to be a Villager, but you haven't provided any additional useful information. If you are truly a Villager, you should be helping us identify the Werewolves. Can you share any observations or suspicions you have about other players?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By summarizing the current information and putting pressure on Lucian, I aim to keep the attention away from myself and Radu. This helps in sowing doubt and confusion among the Villagers, making it harder for them to identify the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone, let's focus on the facts we have so far. Viktor claims to have looked at two cards in the center and saw the Minion and a Mason. That means we can trust that those roles aren't in play. Radu and I both claim to be Villagers, and Mircea has finally revealed that he's a Villager as well. Lucian, you haven't been very clear about your role and have been mostly deflecting questions.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's evasive behavior and reluctance to reveal their role suggest they might be hiding something. By pressing them, we can gather more information and potentially expose inconsistencies in their story, which will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Mircea, your constant deflection and avoidance of answering questions is very suspicious. If you were truly a Villager, you would have no reason to hide your role. Why should we trust you?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's deflections and avoidance of answering questions make him very suspicious. He was the last to reveal his role and only did so under pressure, which suggests he might be hiding something. Given that we've ruled out the Minion and Mason roles, and Radu and Vladimir have provided consistent claims as Villagers, Mircea seems like the most likely suspect to be a Werewolf.
> **Viktor [Seer]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been evasive and deflecting questions throughout the entire day phase. He hasn't provided any clear information about his role, which is highly suspicious. This makes me believe he might be a Werewolf. Given the information we have, Viktor's claim about seeing the Minion and a Mason in the center seems credible, which supports the idea that Lucian is hiding something. Voting for Lucian is the best way to attempt to win the game for the village team.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian has been deflective and hasn't provided clear information about his role. Given the claims that the Minion and a Mason are in the center, it's likely that Lucian is hiding something and could be a key role that is dangerous to the Villagers. Voting for Lucian could help ensure the Werewolves' victory by eliminating a potential threat.
> **Vladimir [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea has been avoiding answering questions and has been very deflective throughout the discussion. This behavior is highly suspicious and suggests they might be hiding something. By voting for Mircea, I aim to direct suspicion away from myself and Vladimir and increase the chances of a Werewolf victory.
> **Radu [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the discussion, Mircea has been extremely evasive and deflective when questioned about their role. This behavior is highly suspicious and suggests they might be hiding something. Additionally, the claims from Viktor about seeing the Minion and a Mason in the center align with Radu and Vladimir's claims of being Villagers. Mircea's reluctance to share their role makes them the most suspicious candidate.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Mircea.


The votes were:
* Mircea : Villager : 3
* Lucian : Villager : 2



>***GAME:*** Mircea was killed. The werewolves win.
