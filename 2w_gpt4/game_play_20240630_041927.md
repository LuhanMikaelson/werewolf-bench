## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Larisa and Mircea. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Alexandra is a minion and is aware that both Larisa and Mircea are werewolves.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dracula. They are thinking about their action.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about what roles might be in play and what roles players might claim. This will help me make more informed deductions during the Day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Sharing this information helps others to cross-reference their claims and deduce who might be lying. It also limits the number of possible roles left for us to consider.
> **Dracula:** I checked two cards from the center and found a Villager and a Mason. This means there might be only one Mason among us and probably a few Villager claims.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula might have more information that can help us deduce which roles are still in play. Confirming the center cards helps us validate or refute other claims.
> **Lucian:** Dracula, can you confirm if you saw any other roles besides Villager and Mason?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** This information helps others cross-reference their claims and deduce who might be lying. It also limits the number of possible roles left for us to consider.
> **Dracula:** I checked two cards from the center and found a Villager and a Mason. This means there might be only one Mason among us and probably a few Villager claims.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to see what Mircea says to ensure our stories align. As Werewolves, we need to be consistent. By asking Mircea directly, it also makes me look like I'm actively trying to figure things out and not just sitting back quietly.
> **Larisa:** Interesting, Dracula. A Villager and a Mason in the center, you say? That might explain why we haven't heard from a second Mason yet. I'd like to hear from everyone about their roles to piece this together better. Mircea, what role do you claim to have?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** We need to gather more information from others to make a better decision. By prompting Lucian and Alexandra to reveal their roles, we can cross-check their claims and look for inconsistencies. This will also help me to subtly cast suspicion away from myself and Larisa.
> **Mircea:** I think it's quite interesting that Dracula claims to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center. If that's the case, then we should only have one Mason among us. I want to hear from Lucian and Alexandra about their roles. This will help us piece together a clearer picture.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing attention to Lucian, I'm trying to gather information on his role while diverting suspicion away from Larisa and Mircea. My aim is to create confusion and doubt among the other players.
> **Alexandra:** I find it very interesting that Dracula claims to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center. If that’s true, we should only have one Mason among us. But we haven't heard from either a Seer or a Mason yet. Lucian, you haven’t shared your role. What role do you claim to have?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Dracula's information suggests only one Mason among us, it is crucial to hear from the other players about their roles to verify this and identify any inconsistencies or potential Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** I find it interesting that Dracula claims to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center. If that's true, we should expect only one Mason among us. Alexandra, what role are you claiming?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Larisa, I can shift suspicion away from Mircea and create chaos among the Villagers. This will help protect the actual Werewolves and keep the focus on others.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, since everyone is dancing around their roles, let's get straight to the point. From what Dracula said, we should only have one Mason among us. Larisa, you've been quite vocal about wanting to hear everyone's roles. I'm getting suspicious of you. Could it be that you're trying to throw us off your scent? Are you the Werewolf here?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By targeting Alexandra, I'm shifting the focus away from Mircea and myself. This helps create confusion and suspicion towards someone who hasn't claimed a role yet, which can potentially deflect any suspicion from the actual Werewolves. Additionally, creating doubt about Alexandra's intentions keeps the discussion active and chaotic, which benefits the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Alexandra, I'm getting some mixed signals from your behavior. You've been quite vocal about my suspicions, but you've avoided stating your own role. Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself? It feels like you might be hiding something.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** By targeting Larisa, I aim to cast doubt on her and divert attention away from Mircea and myself. My goal is to sow confusion among the Villagers, making it harder for them to identify the real Werewolves. This will help protect Larisa and Mircea, increasing our chances of winning.
> **Alexandra:** Everyone seems to be beating around the bush, so I'll just come out and say it: Larisa, I think you're acting way too suspiciously for my taste. You're pushing for everyone to reveal their roles, but you haven't shared yours yet. We all know that a good strategy for a Werewolf is to gather information on everyone else while staying hidden. So, Larisa, are you the Werewolf trying to stay under the radar?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Lucian, I'm trying to create doubt and suspicion around him. This deflects attention away from me and Mircea, which is crucial for our survival as Werewolves. Also, by making it look like I'm actively trying to figure things out, it helps me blend in with the Villagers.
> **Larisa:** Lucian, it's interesting how you've been avoiding directly stating your role even after Alexandra asked you. You've been very careful with your words, and that makes me wonder if you're the one trying to stay under the radar. Can you tell us what role you claim to have?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa has been vocal about wanting to hear from everyone but hasn't revealed her own role, which seems suspicious. It's important to get her to reveal her role to verify if she's hiding something.
> **Lucian:** Larisa, you've been pushing everyone to reveal their roles but haven't shared yours yet. Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself? What role do you claim to have?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the focus on Mircea, I'm trying to see if their response aligns with mine as we need to stay consistent to avoid suspicion. It also helps distract attention from me and puts Mircea in the spotlight to gauge the other players' reactions.
> **Larisa:** Alright, it's pretty clear we're all dancing around the issue here. Since we've heard Dracula's claim that there's a Villager and a Mason in the center, and we're not seeing a second Mason stepping up, I'm finding it increasingly hard to ignore that someone hasn't come out with their role yet. Mircea, you seem to be deflecting a lot of questions back at others without really giving us much to go on. What role do you claim to have?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Larisa, who is actually my fellow Werewolf, I'm attempting to deflect attention away from both of us. This will hopefully draw suspicion towards Larisa, while I continue to act as a concerned Villager trying to figure things out.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, here's what I think. We have Dracula claiming to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center. If that's true, it would imply we only have one Mason among us. Now, Larisa has been very insistent on everyone revealing their roles, which could be a tactic to gather information quietly for herself. I find this quite suspicious.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian has been dodging direct role claims while being vocal about others. By prompting him to reveal his role, we can cross-check for inconsistencies and possibly identify a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Mircea:** Alright, let's think this through carefully. Dracula claims to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, which means we should only have one Mason among us. This actually makes me suspicious of anyone who hasn't claimed to be a Mason, Seer, or Villager yet. Alexandra, you've been vocal but haven't clearly stated your role. Lucian and Larisa have also been avoiding direct claims. If we want to find the Werewolves, we need clear information from everyone. Lucian, what role do you claim to have?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa has been pushing for information from others while avoiding revealing her own role. This behavior is consistent with someone who might be trying to gather intel quietly, which is a typical Werewolf strategy.
> **Lucian:** Larisa, you've been very vocal about wanting everyone to reveal their roles, but you haven't shared yours yet. This seems quite suspicious to me. Are you the Werewolf trying to gather information quietly?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By targeting Alexandra, I'm shifting the focus away from Mircea and myself. This helps create confusion and suspicion towards someone who hasn't claimed a role yet, potentially deflecting any suspicion from the actual Werewolves. Additionally, creating doubt about Alexandra's intentions keeps the discussion active and chaotic, which benefits the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. Dracula has claimed there's a Villager and a Mason in the center, which implies there should only be one Mason among us. Given that, we need to be very clear about our roles. I've noticed Alexandra has been very vocal but hasn't clearly stated her role. Alexandra, can you tell us what role you claim to have?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Lucian, I aim to shift attention away from Larisa and Mircea, the actual Werewolves. Lucian has been careful with his words and avoiding direct claims, which makes him an easy target to cast doubt on. This will help create confusion and protect the actual Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, since everyone is being so cagey about their roles, I'm going to accuse Lucian of being a Werewolf. You've been avoiding giving direct answers and deflecting attention back to others. This is classic Werewolf behavior!


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's behavior of pushing others to reveal their roles while not revealing her own is suspicious. This is often a strategy used by Werewolves to gather information without exposing themselves. By directly questioning Larisa, we can put pressure on her and potentially force a reveal or a slip-up.
> **Lucian:** I have been thinking about how Dracula claimed to see a Villager and a Mason in the center. This means if two people claim to be Masons, one of them is lying. Larisa, you have been very vocal about wanting everyone else to reveal their roles but haven't shared yours yet. Are you hiding something?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Mircea, I'm trying to ensure our stories align as Werewolves. This also makes it look like I'm actively figuring things out, which helps me blend in with the Villagers while casting suspicion on another player.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's think about this logically. We've got Dracula claiming to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, which means there should only be one Mason among us. Now, Mircea has been quite vocal and seems to be trying to deflect attention away from themselves. This makes me very suspicious. Mircea, can you tell us what role you claim to have?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian has been very evasive about revealing his role and has deflected questions back to others multiple times. This suspicious behavior aligns with what a Werewolf might do to avoid detection. Additionally, no one has claimed to be the second Mason, which fits the information I obtained from the center cards. Therefore, I suspect Lucian might be one of the Werewolves.
> **Dracula [Seer]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the day round, Larisa has been very vocal about wanting others to reveal their roles, yet she has not revealed her own role. This behavior is consistent with someone who might be trying to gather information without exposing themselves, which is a typical Werewolf strategy.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Alexandra has been very vocal in accusing others without clearly stating her role, which raises suspicion. By voting for her, it helps deflect attention away from myself and Mircea as we are both Werewolves, and it creates confusion among the Villagers. This chaotic environment benefits the Werewolves.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Minion):*** Lucian has been very evasive about his role and has deflected attention back to others without providing clear information. This behavior is suspicious and aligns with Werewolf behavior. Voting for Lucian will help protect the actual Werewolves, Larisa and Mircea, and increase our chances of winning as the Minion.
> **Alexandra [Minion]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Alexandra has been vocal but evasive about her role. This deflective behavior coupled with her accusations against others makes her a likely target for suspicion. Voting for Alexandra can help draw attention away from Larisa and myself, increasing our chances of winning as Werewolves.
> **Mircea [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Villager : 2
* Larisa : Werewolf : 1
* Alexandra : Minion : 2



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Lucian, Alexandra. The werewolves win.
