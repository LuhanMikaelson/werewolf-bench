## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know that one of the Mason cards is in the center, which could help validate claims from other players. If the Seer or a lone Werewolf checked the center, their information could be pivotal.
> **Andrei:** I think it's crucial to know if anyone had a chance to look at the center cards. This could give us definitive information about where the werewolves might be hiding.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Andrei's question about the center cards could be an attempt to misdirect us. By casting suspicion on him, I can protect myself and my fellow Werewolf, Kraven.
> **Radu:** I find it really interesting that Andrei immediately wanted to know about the center cards. It feels like he's trying to divert attention away from himself. Andrei, why are you so focused on the center cards? Is there something you're not telling us?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Radu's immediate suspicion of my question about the center cards makes me think he might be trying to deflect attention away from himself. This could be a tactic used by a Werewolf or Minion to sow doubt among us.
> **Andrei:** Radu, that's an interesting point you raised about my question. Why are you so quick to suspect me? Do you have any information that the rest of us should know?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Kraven, I can gauge his response and see if he deflects attention away from Andrei. This way, I can subtly support my fellow Werewolf while still appearing inquisitive and helpful to the group. Additionally, it allows me to maintain suspicion on Andrei without directly accusing him again.
> **Radu:** Kraven, you've been pretty quiet so far. I'm curious about your thoughts on Andrei's question regarding the center cards. Do you think it's a valid point to investigate, or do you think Andrei might be trying to mislead us?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking Andrei directly about the center cards, I can gauge his response and see if he slips up or provides useful information. This could either help me identify him as a Seer or cast doubt on him, diverting attention away from myself and Radu.
> **Kraven:** I've been listening to everyone, and Radu's point about Andrei's focus on the center cards is intriguing. However, we need to consider if anyone here might actually be the Seer and has solid information from the center. Andrei, did you see anything specific in the center cards?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven has been quiet, which could be a strategy to avoid drawing attention. If he's a Villager or Seer, he should have some useful information. If he's a Werewolf or Minion, his hesitation might be telling.
> **Andrei:** Kraven, I suspect you might be trying to deflect suspicion by playing it safe and staying quiet. Can you tell us if you have any information or if you are trying to hide something?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting pressure on Andrei to reveal what he knows, we can gauge his reaction and potentially cast doubt on him. This might divert attention away from me and Radu, and if Andrei stumbles, it could help us frame him as a Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Andrei, you keep pressing about the center cards, but you haven’t given us any concrete information yet. If you did see something, now would be the time to share it. If not, your insistence is starting to look suspicious.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's silence might be a tactic to avoid drawing attention. If he has useful information, it could help us. If he's trying to hide his role, this could reveal more about his intentions.
> **Andrei:** Since no one has claimed to be the Seer or provided any concrete information yet, I think it's time to get more direct. Dracula, you've been very quiet and haven't given us much to go on. Do you have any information or role insights that could help us?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been quiet and hasn't shared any useful information. I'd like to press him to see if he has anything to contribute that could help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, you've been very cautious and haven't shared much. Do you have any information about your role or any insights from the night phase?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question to Dracula, I can shift some focus away from myself and Radu. If Dracula struggles to provide useful information or seems suspicious, it helps to cast doubt on a non-Werewolf player. This can also help in identifying any roles he might hint at or claim, aiding in our strategy.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, you've been pretty quiet so far. Given the fact that Andrei's focus on the center cards seems a bit off, I want to know what you think about his insistence. Do you think it's a legitimate concern, or might he be trying to hide something? Also, do you have any information or insights from the night phase to share?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's persistent inquiry about the center cards could be a tactic to mislead us and steer the conversation away from his role. By directly questioning him, we might gather more insights and potentially expose any inconsistencies in his story.
> **Dracula:** Andrei, you've been very vocal about the center cards, which is making me suspicious of your intentions. Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself? What role do you claim to have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's silence could be a strategy to avoid drawing attention, which is often a tactic used by Werewolves or Minions. By pressing him now, we might get him to slip up or reveal something important.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, I find it quite suspicious that you've been so quiet this whole time. It's time for you to come clean about your role. Why haven't you shared any information yet?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's persistent inquiry about the center cards could be a tactic to mislead us and steer the conversation away from his role. By directly questioning him, we might gather more insights and potentially expose any inconsistencies in his story.
> **Dracula:** Andrei, you've been very vocal about the center cards, which is making me suspicious of your intentions. Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself? What role do you claim to have?

> **Andrei:** Dracula, you've been very quiet and it makes me suspicious. Why haven't you shared any information yet, and what role do you claim to have?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been quick to suspect Andrei, but we need to know more about his role to understand his motivations. If he provides any concrete information, it might help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Radu, I noticed you've been pretty active in questioning Andrei, but you haven't given us any solid information about your own role. What role do you claim to have, and did you see anything during the night phase?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula has been deflecting and repeating questions without giving concrete information, which is suspicious. By pressing him for more details, I can keep other players focused on him and away from Kraven and me.
> **Radu:** Dracula, you've been very quiet and it makes me suspicious. Why haven't you shared any information yet, and what role do you claim to have?

> **Dracula:** Andrei, you've been very vocal about the center cards, which is making me suspicious of your intentions. Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself? What role do you claim to have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's silence and evasiveness are typical of someone trying to hide their identity, which is often a strategy used by Werewolves or Minions. Pressuring him might force him to reveal something important or slip up.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, you've been avoiding sharing any information and deflecting questions back at others. This is very suspicious behavior. What role do you claim, and why haven't you given us any useful information so far?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been quick to question others, particularly Andrei, but hasn't provided any concrete information about his own role. By pressing him, we can gather more information to help identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Radu, you seem very eager to accuse others, but you haven't shared much about your own role. What role do you claim to have, and what did you see during the night phase?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula has been acting suspiciously by deflecting questions and repeating himself without providing any new information. By pressing him for details, I can keep the focus on him and away from Kraven and me. This also aligns with the previous suspicions raised by other players, making my accusation seem more credible.
> **Radu:** Dracula, your constant deflections and repeating questions without giving us any solid information are making you look very suspicious. What role do you claim to have, and why haven't you shared anything useful so far?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula has been extremely evasive and hasn't provided any useful information despite being questioned multiple times. His behavior is very consistent with that of a Werewolf or Minion trying to avoid suspicion. This makes him the most likely threat to the village team.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula has been deflecting questions and repeating himself without providing any new information. This makes him look very suspicious. By voting for Dracula, I can divert attention away from my fellow Werewolf, Kraven, and myself, increasing our chances of winning.
> **Radu [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been very vocal about focusing on the center cards, which seems like a tactic to divert attention from himself. His persistent questioning and deflecting suspicion onto others, while not providing any concrete information, make him the most suspicious to me. Therefore, I believe he might be a Werewolf trying to distract us.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Andrei's persistent focus on the center cards without providing any concrete information seems like a diversion tactic. This suspicion has been echoed by multiple players. By voting for Andrei, I can help shift the attention away from myself and Radu, potentially ensuring our victory as Werewolves.
> **Kraven [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been deflecting questions and repeating the same queries without providing any useful information. This consistent avoidance of sharing their role or insights makes them appear the most suspicious among all players.
> **Alexia [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Mason : 2
* Dracula : Villager : 3



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
