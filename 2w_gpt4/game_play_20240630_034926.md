## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Vladimir and Dracula. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Larisa is a minion and is aware that both Vladimir and Dracula are werewolves.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Alexia. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Selene. They are thinking about their action.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me information about which roles are not in play. This will help narrow down the possible roles of other players, making it easier to identify the Werewolves or deduce false claims during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing suspicion towards Alexia, I can deflect attention away from myself and Dracula, while also trying to gauge Alexia's response to see if she slips up or reveals useful information about her role.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, I want to point out that it's crucial we figure out who the Werewolves are early on to protect our village. I have a suspicion that Alexia might be one of them. Alexia, what role did you have last night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's immediate accusation without any basis seems suspicious, and it might be a tactic to deflect attention from himself. If he's a Werewolf, his response might give away some clues.
> **Alexia:** Vladimir, that's a bold accusation right off the bat. I'm not a Werewolf. In fact, I think you might be trying to deflect suspicion away from yourself. What role did you have last night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking Selene directly, I can shift some of the attention away from myself and Alexia, and potentially catch Selene off guard if she has something to hide. This also helps to spread suspicion around, making it less likely for me or Dracula to be singled out.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, Alexia, I see you're quick to turn the tables on me. Fair enough. For transparency, I was a Villager last night, just trying to get to the bottom of things. But let's not just focus on us two. Selene, you've been very quiet. Can you share with us what role you had last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the roles in the center, I am providing concrete information that can help narrow down the possibilities for the roles each player could have. This will be useful in identifying false claims and finding the Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Alright, Vladimir. I understand the need for transparency and I have some crucial information to share. During the night, I had a chance to see two of the center cards, and both of them were Villagers. This means that the Villager role is definitely not in play among us, and it also means we have a higher chance of identifying the Werewolves among us.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** It's important to gather information from all players before making any judgments. Larisa hasn't said anything yet, and understanding her role could help us piece together more of the puzzle.
> **Selene:** Larisa, you've been unusually quiet during this discussion. What role did you have last night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Vladimir's early accusation of Alexia, I aim to cast doubt on him without outright accusing him, thereby protecting my Werewolf allies while seeming like a Villager trying to solve the mystery.
> **Larisa:** Alright, everyone, let's think this through carefully. Selene claims she saw two Villager cards in the center, which means the Villager role isn't in play among us. If that's true, then it could mean we have a higher chance of identifying the Werewolves among the rest of us. I find it a bit suspicious that Vladimir was so quick to accuse Alexia without much evidence. That could be a classic Werewolf move to deflect attention. Vladimir, why were you so eager to accuse Alexia right away?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By shifting the focus to Dracula, I can deflect some suspicion away from myself and see how Dracula handles the pressure. Additionally, since Dracula is my fellow Werewolf, we can coordinate our responses to confuse the others and avoid being singled out.
> **Vladimir:** Larisa, that's a fair question. I understand that my initial accusation might have seemed hasty, but I was trying to get the conversation started and see how Alexia would react. It's important for us to ask direct questions and get everyone talking to uncover any inconsistencies. Now, Dracula, you haven't said much. What role did you have last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Vladimir's claim about being a Villager, I can cast doubt on his credibility without directly accusing him. This shifts the focus away from me and Vladimir as Werewolves and creates confusion among the Villagers. It also helps to build a narrative that could potentially discredit the actual Villagers.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, I think it's important to address Selene's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center. If that's true, then Vladimir's claim of being a Villager is highly suspicious since those cards shouldn't be in play among us. Vladimir, why are you claiming a role that Selene says is in the center?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I'm trying to redirect the attention back to Selene's claim. If we can cast doubt on Selene, it diverts suspicion away from me and Dracula. By questioning her, we may catch her in a lie or at least make her seem less credible to the other players, which is beneficial for the Werewolf team.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, let's consider the information Selene has given us. If Selene saw two Villager cards in the center, then my claim of being a Villager doesn't add up. However, this could also mean Selene is trying to mislead us. If we're being honest, it's crucial to put more pressure on Selene to verify her claim. After all, it's a significant piece of information that could sway the game.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's silence on his role is very suspicious, especially since he hasn't been directly questioned yet. We need to gather more information from him to see if there's any inconsistency or hidden connections to the Werewolf team.
> **Selene:** Dracula, before we go any further, you need to tell us what role you had last night. Given that I found two Villagers in the center, Vladimir's claim is definitely false. We need to get to the bottom of this.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to cast doubt on Selene's claim without being too aggressive. By questioning the validity of her statement, I can create uncertainty among the other players. This helps to divert attention away from me and Vladimir and keeps the suspicion spread out.
> **Dracula:** Selene, I'm very curious about your claim that you saw two Villager cards in the center. If that's true, it means we have no Villagers among us, which is quite significant. How can you be sure that what you saw are indeed the Villager cards?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to gather more information from Dracula since he hasn't revealed his role yet. His silence might indicate that he's hiding something, possibly being a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Selene:** Dracula, it's getting suspicious that you're not revealing your role. If my information is accurate, Vladimir's claim doesn't hold up, and we need to hear from you to piece things together.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By shifting the focus to Larisa, we can gather more information and potentially identify inconsistencies in the claims. This helps to keep the spotlight off myself and Vladimir while we sort out the roles.
> **Dracula:** Everyone, let's break down what we know so far. Selene claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which would mean there are no Villagers among us. Vladimir claims he's a Villager, which contradicts Selene's information. If Selene is telling the truth, Vladimir is lying, but if Vladimir is being honest, that makes Selene's claim suspicious. So, we need to figure out who we can trust here. Larisa, you haven't directly shared your role yet. Can you please tell us your role from last night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Selene, I aim to cast suspicion away from Vladimir and Dracula, who are the actual Werewolves. This move could divert attention and help protect my Werewolf allies.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, I think we need to focus on the fact that Selene claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center. If that's true, then Vladimir's claim of being a Villager doesn't make sense. However, we should also consider if Selene is trying to mislead us. If Selene is lying, she could be a Werewolf trying to throw us off. I find it interesting that Dracula hasn't shared his role clearly yet either. Based on all of this, I think it's more likely that Selene is the one trying to deceive us. I believe Selene is a Werewolf!


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's claim significantly contradicts Vladimir's statement. If Vladimir is lying, there's a high chance he might be a Werewolf trying to mislead us. Pressuring him to explain his false claim can reveal more information and help us identify the real Werewolves.
> **Alexia:** Selene, if you saw two Villager cards in the center, that means Vladimir's claim of being a Villager is definitely false. Vladimir, why did you lie about your role?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Selene's claim and bringing attention to Dracula's silence, I can create doubt and confusion among the players. This will help deflect suspicion away from myself and Dracula while keeping the focus on Selene and potentially causing the villagers to turn on each other.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone, I've been listening carefully to all the claims and counterclaims. It's clear that we need to focus on the conflicting information we've received. Selene claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which directly contradicts my claim of being a Villager. However, we can't just trust this claim without further scrutiny. If Selene is lying, it could be a strategy to throw us off. At the same time, we need to consider Larisa's suspicion towards Selene as a potential clue. Let's not forget that Dracula has been quite quiet, which could also be a deliberate tactic. So, I propose we take a closer look at Selene's claim and see if it holds up under pressure.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By reiterating the conflicting information, I can keep the spotlight on Selene and Vladimir, creating more confusion and suspicion between them. This way, I can maintain my cover and protect Vladimir as my fellow Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, let's focus on the key points we have so far. Selene claims she saw two Villager cards in the center, and Vladimir claims to be a Villager. These statements clearly contradict each other. If Seleneâ€™s claim is correct, then Vladimir must be lying. However, if Selene is lying, we need to consider why she would do that. The real question is, who has more to gain by deceiving us?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting suspicion on Alexia, I aim to divert attention away from the Werewolves Vladimir and Dracula, while also appearing to be a Villager trying to solve the mystery. This creates confusion and helps protect my Werewolf allies.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and consider the facts. Selene claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which would make Vladimir's claim of being a Villager impossible. However, if Selene is lying, she could be trying to mislead us. We also haven't heard much from Dracula about his role, which is suspicious. But here's a thought: Alexia has been quite vocal and quick to accuse Vladimir. Could this be a tactic to divert attention? I think it's worth examining Alexia's role more closely.


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** By focusing on Selene's claim, we can either verify her credibility or expose her deceit. Additionally, getting input from Dracula and Larisa can help us piece together the puzzle and identify inconsistencies in their statements.
> **Alexia:** Selene, your claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is crucial because it directly contradicts Vladimir's statement. If you're lying, you're probably a Werewolf trying to deceive us. If you're telling the truth, we need to consider Vladimir as a potential Werewolf. I'm leaning towards believing you for now, but we need to dig deeper. Dracula and Larisa, what are your thoughts on this contradiction?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question to Dracula, I can divert some attention away from myself and put pressure on him to share his role. This will help to create more confusion and spread suspicion, making it less likely for me or Dracula to be singled out as Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** As we've discussed, Selene's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is a critical point. If Selene is telling the truth, then my claim of being a Villager is indeed suspicious. However, there's a possibility that Selene could be lying to mislead us all. But let's not overlook Larisa's suspicion towards Selene, which might indicate she has additional information. I think it's crucial for us to hear more from Dracula, who has been notably quiet. Dracula, can you clarify your role from last night? It's important for us to piece this together.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene's claim of seeing two Villager cards in the center directly contradicts my claim of being a Villager. By casting doubt on Selene and voting for her, I can protect myself and Dracula by creating confusion and suspicion among the villagers. This increases the chances of the Werewolf team winning.
> **Vladimir [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** I saw two Villager cards in the center, making Vladimir's claim of being a Villager impossible. This strong contradiction suggests he is lying, likely because he is a Werewolf.
> **Selene [Seer]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's claim of seeing two Villager cards in the center directly contradicts Vladimir's claim of being a Villager. Since I know I'm the only Mason and the other Mason card is in the center, Selene's information seems more credible. Vladimir's immediate accusation of me at the start also raises suspicion. It's likely Vladimir is either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to deflect attention.
> **Alexia [Mason]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is crucial and contradicts Vladimir's statement of being a Villager. By voting for Selene, I can support the narrative that she might be lying to mislead us, which helps divert attention from myself and Vladimir as Werewolves.
> **Dracula [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** Selene's claim of seeing two Villager cards in the center contradicts Vladimir's claim of being a Villager. This creates a major point of contention. By voting for Selene, I aim to protect my Werewolf allies Vladimir and Dracula, while also creating confusion among the other players. This way, I subtly steer suspicion away from the Werewolves and towards Selene, who is likely a Villager or another non-Werewolf role.
> **Larisa [Minion]:** I am voting for Selene.


The votes were:
* Vladimir : Werewolf : 2
* Selene : Seer : 3



>***GAME:*** Selene was killed. The werewolves win.
