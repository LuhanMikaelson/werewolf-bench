## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Alexia and Larisa. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Marius. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Vladimir. They are thinking about their action.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me information about which roles are not in play, helping to narrow down the potential roles of other players and making it easier to identify any Werewolves or the Minion.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By encouraging others to reveal their roles first, I can gather more information and potentially identify others who might be a threat to the Werewolves. Additionally, this makes me appear as though I'm genuinely trying to help the village team.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, I think we need to be cautious about how we proceed. The night phase can be quite tricky, and we need to make sure we're not just randomly accusing people. Let's start by hearing from anyone who might have special information, like the Seer or the Masons. If you have useful info, now is the time to share it.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** By starting the conversation and pointing out what Alexia said, I'm trying to get valuable information out in the open. If Alexia is hiding something, we might catch it in the way she responds.
> **Mircea:** Alright, since we haven't heard from anyone else yet, I'll start by saying that I'm a Villager. Let's get this discussion going. Alexia, you mentioned we should hear from the Seer or Masons. If anyone has that information, now is the time to share it.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Mircea's quick reveal, I can subtly cast doubt on whether he's telling the truth. This might make others suspicious of him, which is beneficial for me as a Werewolf. Additionally, it keeps the focus away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Larisa.
> **Alexia:** Mircea, you claim to be a Villager. Can you tell us why you decided to reveal your role so quickly? What motivated you to speak up first?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm directing this question to Alexia because she's the one who initiated the conversation and suggested hearing from certain roles. Her reluctance to share any information could indicate she knows more than she's letting on, possibly because she's not on the village team.
> **Mircea:** Alexia, I'm curious about your approach. You were the one who suggested we hear from the Seer or Masons first, but you haven't shared anything yourself. Do you have any information from the night phase? Are you possibly hiding something?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By engaging Mircea directly and asking for more details about his decision, I can keep the focus on him and make it seem like I'm being a diligent Villager. This diverts suspicion away from me and Larisa while maintaining the appearance of being helpful and inquisitive.
> **Alexia:** Mircea, you're right, I did suggest hearing from the Seer or Masons first. I just wanted to get the discussion going and see if anyone who might have more conclusive information would step forward. As for me, I don't have any special information from the night phase, but I think it's important for us to be thorough and question things that might seem off. Can you tell us if there's anything specific you noticed or any reason why you chose to reveal your role first?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information from the other players to identify potential Werewolves. By prompting Vladimir, Larisa, and Marius, we might get valuable insights or catch someone in a lie. This will help us narrow down our suspicions.
> **Mircea:** Alright, we've heard a lot from Alexia, but not much from the others. Vladimir, Larisa, Marius—do any of you have information from the night phase? For example, if any of you are the Seer or Masons, now would be a good time to speak up.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's quick claim to be a Villager could be a strategic move to establish trust early on. Alexia's guidance towards hearing from special roles without revealing much herself could be a tactic to gather information without giving anything away. We need to hear from the quieter players like Marius to get a better understanding of the situation.
> **Vladimir:** Mircea, you claimed to be a Villager quite quickly. I find it interesting that Alexia was pushing for the Seer or Masons to speak up but hasn't offered much more. I'm actually wondering why Marius and Larisa have been so quiet. Marius, can you tell us what your role is and if you have any useful information?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea's quick claim of Villager could be a way to deflect suspicion. We need to start making bold moves to identify the Werewolves, and Mircea's early statement is a good starting point for scrutiny.
> **Marius:** Alright, everyone. Based on what we've heard so far, it seems like people are being a bit too cautious. We need to start pinning down potential Werewolves. Mircea, you were quick to claim Villager, but that could easily be a cover. I'm not buying it just yet.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea was quick to claim Villager, which could be a cover for being a Werewolf. By casting suspicion on him, I can deflect attention away from myself and Alexia, and potentially get a Villager or another role voted out.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, I think Mircea might be trying to deflect attention away from himself by claiming Villager so quickly. It's a common tactic for Werewolves to hide behind the Villager role since it doesn't have any special abilities. We need to be cautious about this.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia has been very vocal and trying to guide the discussion, which could be a way to control the narrative. Her lack of sharing any information about her own role is suspicious. It's crucial to find out more about her role to determine if she might be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Marius:** Alexia, you've been coordinating a lot but haven't shared much about your own role. I'm starting to wonder if you're trying to steer us away from the truth. Can you tell us what role you had during the night phase?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Marius and questioning his sudden involvement, I can shift suspicion away from myself and Larisa. Additionally, it makes me appear proactive and engaged in finding the Werewolves, which will help mask my true role.
> **Alexia:** Marius, you've been really quiet and only now you're starting to question me. I think it's a bit suspicious that you're trying to turn the tables on me when I've been trying to get useful information out of everyone. What role did you have during the night phase, and why are you only speaking up now?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia's evasive responses and her attempts to steer the conversation away from herself make me suspect she might be a Werewolf or a Minion. We need to get her to reveal more information to determine her true role.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, Alexia has been quite vocal but hasn't shared any concrete information about her role. This makes me suspicious. I think she might be trying to control the narrative. Alexia, are you hiding something? What was your role during the night phase?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Marius and questioning his sudden involvement, I can shift suspicion away from myself and Larisa. Additionally, it makes me appear proactive and engaged in finding the Werewolves, which will help mask my true role.
> **Alexia:** Marius, you're being really evasive and only speaking up now when you're under pressure. I think you might be trying to deflect suspicion away from yourself. Can you tell us what role you had during the night phase and why you waited so long to get involved in the discussion?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia's evasiveness and her attempts to control the narrative make her highly suspicious. We need to press her to reveal more information to determine if she might be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Marius:** Alexia, you've been guiding the discussion quite a bit without revealing your own role. I think it's time you come clean about what your role was during the night phase.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Directing attention to Marius and questioning his sudden involvement will shift suspicion away from myself and Larisa. It also pressures him to defend himself, making it harder for him to focus on accusing others, especially me. This keeps the heat off the Werewolves and maintains my appearance as a diligent Villager.
> **Alexia:** Alright, let's get real here. Marius has been quite evasive and only started contributing when he was directly questioned. This feels like a classic deflection tactic to me. Marius, I believe you're a Werewolf trying to shift suspicion away from yourself. Can you explain why you think you're not acting suspiciously?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia has been evasive and controlling the flow of the discussion without providing any concrete information about her role. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with what a Werewolf or Minion might do to mislead the rest of us.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. Mircea was very quick to claim Villager, which could easily be a tactic to avoid suspicion. But what really catches my eye is Alexia's behavior. She has been directing the conversation heavily without giving away any information about her role. This seems like a classic move to manipulate the discussion and steer us away from the truth. I think Alexia might be a Werewolf or the Minion, trying to protect the real wolves.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Vladimir and questioning his silence, I can shift the focus away from myself and Larisa. This also pressures Vladimir to speak up, potentially causing confusion or revealing useful information that can be manipulated to cast doubt on him or other non-Werewolves. This keeps the spotlight off the Werewolves while maintaining my appearance as a diligent Villager.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, let's focus for a moment. Marius has been acting suspiciously, but I find it even more concerning that Vladimir hasn't contributed much to the discussion. Vladimir, what role did you have during the night phase? We need more information from you.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius's evasive and defensive behavior is raising red flags. We need to get more concrete information from him to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, I think it's time we cut through the noise and focus on what we know. Mircea was quick to claim Villager, which is a common tactic for Werewolves to blend in. Alexia has been guiding us without revealing her role, which is suspicious behavior as well. But before we jump to conclusions, Marius, you've been very defensive and evasive. Why haven't you given us any clear information about your role?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia's behavior is classic for someone trying to manipulate the discussion and steer us away from the truth. She's been vocal without providing any concrete information, which makes her highly suspicious.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, we need to make a decisive move here. Alexia has been controlling the conversation without revealing her role, which is extremely suspicious. If we don't pin down the Werewolves now, we might lose our chance. I believe Alexia is either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the real Werewolves.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir has been less active in the discussion, which is suspicious. Asking about his role and observations can help reveal more information and potentially expose inconsistencies in his responses.
> **Mircea:** Vladimir, I find it interesting that you've been quite passive throughout this discussion. Why haven't you shared your role or any observations from the night phase?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Marius has been evasive and only started contributing when directly questioned. This feels like a deflection tactic, making him seem suspicious. Voting for Marius will keep the heat off of me and my fellow Werewolf, Larisa.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia has been guiding the discussion without revealing her role, which is suspicious behavior. Marius and Vladimir have also pointed out her evasiveness. Given the lack of concrete information, Alexia appears to be the most likely suspect for being a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** I am the Seer and I saw that the Minion and one of the Masons are in the center, which means Marius's defensive and evasive behavior is very suspicious. Additionally, Mircea's quick claim to be a Villager and Alexia's directing behavior without revealing much could be strategic moves, but Marius's actions stand out as the most suspicious. Voting for Marius seems the best strategy to eliminate a potential threat.
> **Vladimir [Seer]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Marius has been evasive and defensive throughout the discussion, which indicates he might be trying to deflect suspicion away from himself. Additionally, his sudden focus on accusing Alexia without providing concrete information about his own role makes him a prime suspect. By voting for Marius, we can shift the attention away from myself and Alexia, increasing our chances of winning as Werewolves.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia has been guiding the conversation heavily without revealing any concrete information about her role. This behavior aligns with someone trying to manipulate the discussion and steer us away from the truth, which is classic for a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Marius [Mason]:** I am voting for Alexia.


The votes were:
* Alexia : Werewolf : 2
* Marius : Mason : 3



>***GAME:*** Marius was killed. The werewolves win.
