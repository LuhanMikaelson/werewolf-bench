## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Alexia and Viktor. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Andrei. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dragos. They are thinking about their action.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards gives me more information about the possible roles that are not in play, which can help narrow down the potential werewolves among the players.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing this, I can help the Masons identify each other more easily and narrow down the pool of potential Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** I saw two cards in the center: one was a Mason and the other was a Villager. This means there is only one Mason in play among us.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Dragos' claim and asking others to confirm their roles, I can gather more information and possibly create confusion among the villagers. This will help deflect any suspicion away from me and Viktor while we work out who might be lying or telling the truth about their roles.
> **Alexia:** Okay, Dragos, that's interesting information you've got there. But I have a question: If you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, it means you must be the Seer, right? Can anyone else confirm their role to cross-check this?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Since the presence of a Mason in the center limits the possibility of two Masons, it's crucial to identify the remaining Mason and verify other roles to narrow down the suspects for Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Based on what I saw, we know that there's only one Mason among us. Viktor, what role do you claim to have?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I'm trying to cast suspicion away from myself and Alexia, the other Werewolf, by putting the spotlight on Andrei. By doing this, I aim to confuse the Villagers and divert their attention.
> **Viktor:** Alright, Dragos and Alexia, that's some interesting information. But I have to say, I am very suspicious of Andrei. He has been awfully quiet and hasn't claimed anything yet. Maybe he's trying to hide something?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Alexia, I am appearing to participate in the game actively and logically. This also gives Alexia a chance to weave a story that fits our narrative and helps divert attention from us as Werewolves. At the same time, it creates doubt in others' minds about her, setting up a potential scapegoat if needed.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, I'm a bit confused here. Dragos claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, which would make him the Seer. If that's true, it adds up. But Alexia, you're quick to ask for cross-confirmation without sharing your own role. That makes me a bit suspicious. Alexia, can you confirm your role or provide more information?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Andrei, I can potentially create confusion or reveal inconsistencies, which might help deflect suspicion away from me and Viktor. It's important to gather as much information as possible while keeping the focus off myself and my fellow Werewolf.
> **Alexia:** Let's get some clarity here. Andrei, you've been quiet so far. Can you tell us what role you have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** By asserting that I am the Mason, I confirm Dragos's Seer claim about the center cards, which helps to build trust for our team. By questioning Viktor's quick accusation without revealing his role, I aim to put pressure on him to reveal more information, potentially exposing inconsistencies.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's clear things up a bit here. Dragos claims to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. I can confirm that there should only be one Mason because I am the Mason! So, Dragos's information checks out in that regard. But Viktor, why are you so quick to throw suspicion on me without stating your own role? That seems a bit too convenient for a Werewolf trying to deflect attention.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Andrei's sudden claim, I can cast doubt on his credibility and potentially paint him as the Minion, which would divert suspicion from me and Alexia. This also helps me understand his motives and see if he's trying to protect any Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, that's quite a shift from being quiet to suddenly claiming to be the Mason after Dragos already gave us that information. It seems a bit too convenient for you to just confirm Dragos's claim after the fact. I'm starting to think you might be the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf. What do you have to say about that?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's quick accusation without disclosing his own role raises suspicion. By asking for his role, I aim to gather more information and possibly catch him in a lie, which could indicate he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, you've been quick to cast suspicion on me without revealing your own role. Can you tell us what role you have?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the attention to Larisa, I aim to gather more information and potentially find inconsistencies in the villagers' claims. This also takes some heat off me and Alexia by keeping the conversation moving and spreading suspicion.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone, let's step back and think logically here. Dragos claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, which would make him the Seer. Andrei now claims to be the Mason, which aligns with Dragos’s information if true. But let's remember, we still have roles unaccounted for. Larisa, you've been notably silent. Can you tell us your role and if you have any information that can help us?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been pointing fingers without providing any concrete information about his own role. If he is indeed hiding something or deflecting attention, he might be a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's step back and think about this logically. Dragos claims to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, which checks out given that Andrei claims to be the Mason. But Viktor has been very quick to cast suspicion without revealing his own role. Viktor, I think it's time you tell us what role you have. Are you hiding something?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the attention to Larisa, I aim to gather more information and potentially find inconsistencies in the villagers' claims. This also takes some heat off me and Alexia by keeping the conversation moving and spreading suspicion.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's think this through carefully. Andrei's claim to be the Mason does align with Dragos's claim as the Seer. However, I think there might be something we're overlooking. If Dragos is truly the Seer and Andrei is the Mason, that still leaves us with roles unaccounted for. I'm starting to wonder if Larisa is trying to stay under the radar. Larisa, can you tell us your role and if you have any information that can help us clarify these claims?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's evasiveness and finger-pointing without providing any concrete information about his role are highly suspicious. It feels like he is trying to deflect attention and confusion, which could be a tactic used by a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Larisa:** Viktor, you've been pointing fingers constantly without revealing your own role. Why haven't you told us what your role is? What are you hiding?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pushing Larisa to reveal her role, I aim to gather more information and maintain the appearance of being an active participant. It also helps divert attention from me and keeps the conversation moving.
> **Viktor:** Larisa, you're right. I've been vocal because I'm trying to get to the truth. But let's get back to you. You've been quiet and only spoke up when directly asked. What role are you claiming?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been evasive and pointing fingers without providing any concrete information about his role. It's important to get clarity from him as his behavior is highly suspicious.
> **Larisa:** Viktor, I find it very suspicious that you've been so quick to accuse others without ever revealing your own role. Andrei and Dragos have both provided useful information that aligns. What role are you hiding, Viktor?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By accusing Larisa of being the Werewolf, I aim to divert suspicion away from myself and Alexia. Larisa's reluctance to share information makes her an easy target, and this helps keep the attention off us.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and recap. Dragos claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, which would make him the Seer. Andrei then confirmed he's the Mason, which aligns with Dragos's information. But let's not forget, we still have roles unaccounted for. Larisa, you have been quite reluctant to share anything meaningful. Your silence is suspicious to me. I think you might be the Werewolf trying to stay under the radar.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's behavior is highly suspicious. He's constantly deflecting and accusing others but hasn't revealed any information about his own role, which is a common tactic for someone trying to hide their true identity, especially if they are a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Larisa:** Viktor, you've been very evasive and quick to accuse others without providing any concrete information about your own role. Why haven't you told us what your role is? What are you hiding?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the day phase, Larisa has been notably quiet and only responds when directly questioned. This behavior can be interpreted as trying to stay under the radar, which is suspicious. By accusing Larisa, I aim to divert attention from myself and Alexia while casting doubt on a player who hasn't provided much information.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's think logically here. Dragos claims to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, which checks out if Andrei is telling the truth about being a Mason. But Larisa, you've been very quiet and only seem to speak up when directly addressed. This makes me very suspicious of you. Based on the information we have and your reluctance to share, I think you might be hiding something. Larisa, I accuse you of being the Werewolf.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been quick to accuse others and has not disclosed his role. By directly asking him, I aim to put pressure on him to reveal his role, which might expose inconsistencies and help us identify if he is a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Andrei:** Alright, it's time to get some real clarity. Viktor, you've been very vocal without revealing your role, while Dragos and I have provided information that lines up. I'm starting to think you might be trying to deflect suspicion off yourself because you have something to hide. What role are you claiming?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa's silence and reluctance to share her role is suspicious. By accusing her, I aim to divert attention from myself and Alexia while casting doubt on a player who hasn't provided much information.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think about this for a moment. Dragos claims to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Andrei has confirmed he's the Mason, which aligns with Dragos. However, Larisa has been very quiet and only speaks up when directly addressed. This makes me very suspicious of her. So, Larisa, I accuse you of being the Werewolf!

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** I am confident in my role as the Seer and the information I provided aligns with Andrei being the Mason. Viktor has been overly aggressive and evasive without revealing his own role, which is a common tactic for a Werewolf or Minion trying to deflect suspicion. His insistence on accusing others without providing concrete information makes him the most likely candidate for a Werewolf.
> **Dragos [Seer]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa has been notably silent and only spoke up when directly addressed, which makes me suspicious. Dragos's claim to be the Seer aligns with Andrei's claim to be a Mason, which leaves Larisa as the most likely suspect.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the day phase, Larisa has been notably quiet and only responded when directly questioned. This behavior can be interpreted as trying to stay under the radar, which is suspicious. By voting for Larisa, I aim to divert suspicion from myself and Alexia while casting doubt on a player who hasn't provided much information.
> **Viktor [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been very vocal in accusing others without ever revealing his own role, which is highly suspicious. He might be either a Werewolf trying to deflect attention or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves. Since Dragos's Seer claim and my Mason claim align, Viktor's behavior stands out the most as an attempt to mislead us.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been very evasive and quick to accuse others without revealing his own role. His behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with the tactics of a Werewolf or Minion trying to deflect attention.
> **Larisa [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


The votes were:
* Viktor : Werewolf : 3
* Larisa : Villager : 2
