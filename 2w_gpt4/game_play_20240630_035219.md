## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Larisa and Kraven. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Ileana. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Stefan. They are thinking about their action.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can potentially identify roles that are not in play, which can help me narrow down the possibilities of what roles the other players might have. This will provide valuable information for the discussion during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing my role as a Mason and the fact that the other Mason card is in the center, I am providing verifiable information to the group. This can help the Seer and Villagers trust me. It also helps eliminate confusion about the Mason role, which allows us to focus on identifying the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Okay everyone, I have something to say. I am a Mason, and I didn't see another Mason last night. This means the other Mason card must be in the center.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to understand Ileana's intentions and also see if she is potentially hiding something. Given that I know the Minion card is in the center, I'm trying to see if there's a chance she's bluffing as a Mason to protect a Werewolf.
> **Stefan:** Ileana, I'm curious why you are so quick to reveal yourself as a Mason. Do you think this information will help us narrow things down, or do you have another motive?


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** Stefan seems suspicious of my early reveal, and by asking him directly about his role, we can gauge his reaction and see if he's trying to deflect attention or provide valuable information.
> **Ileana:** Stefan, I'm revealing myself because it's crucial for the Villagers to know who they can trust. By confirming that one of the Mason cards is in the center, I'm helping narrow down the possibilities for the Werewolves. What role did you have last night?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I looked at two of the center cards last night and saw the Minion card. This information helps us eliminate any false claims about being the Minion and narrows down our search for the Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** I can confirm that the Minion card is in the center. This means any claim of being a Minion is false, and we should focus on identifying the Werewolves.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Stefan's certainty, I can cast doubt on his claim and potentially confuse the other players. If Stefan is a Villager or Seer, this could divert attention away from Kraven and myself.
> **Larisa:** Stefan, it's interesting that you're so confident about the Minion card being in the center. How can you be so sure? Did you use a special ability last night to check the center cards?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** By directing the question to Larisa, I can gather more information about her role and see if she might be hiding something. Her response will help us narrow down the possibilities and identify potential Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Larisa, I'm confident because I used my ability last night to check the center cards and saw that the Minion card is indeed there. This means we should focus on identifying the Werewolves among us. What role did you have last night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking Stefan to specify the other card he saw, I'm trying to put him on the spot and see if he can provide convincing details. If he stumbles or hesitates, it could cast doubt on his credibility and divert suspicion away from Kraven and myself. Additionally, this might create some confusion among the Villagers, making it harder for them to pin down the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Stefan, I'm finding it a bit hard to fully trust your claim about the Minion card being in the center. If you were able to check the center cards, can you specify which other card you saw to verify your claim? This could help us narrow things down.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** By providing additional details about what I saw in the center, I can substantiate my claim and put more pressure on Larisa to reveal her role. This can help us gather more information and identify potential Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Larisa, I appreciate you questioning my information, but let me clarify. Along with the Minion, I also saw a Villager card in the center. This should further support my claim since it’s consistent with the roles we have in play. So, let me ask you again, what role did you have last night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Kraven, I'm subtly checking in with my fellow Werewolf to see how he will respond. This allows him to either support my narrative or create his own to further shield both of us from suspicion. It also helps shift the focus away from me.
> **Larisa:** Kraven, you've been awfully quiet. What role did you have last night, and do you have any information that could help us identify the Werewolves?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Larisa and questioning her evasiveness, I can deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf. This can create doubt about Larisa's intentions and potentially lead others to think she is a Werewolf, which helps protect our team.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, I find it very suspicious that you keep deflecting from answering Stefan's question about your own role. Are you trying to hide something? It seems like you might be trying to cover up being a Werewolf by casting doubt on Stefan's information.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing suspicion toward Stefan, I'm trying to cast doubt on his credibility. If the other players start doubting him, it can shift the focus away from Kraven and me, making it harder for the Villagers to identify us as Werewolves. Additionally, this could create confusion and make it more challenging for the Villagers to work together effectively.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, I've been thinking about the information we've got so far. Ileana claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which means one Mason card is in the center. Stefan claims to have seen the Minion and a Villager in the center. But here's the thing: I find it a bit too convenient that Stefan is so sure about what he saw. It's almost like he's trying to steer us away from something. So, to shake things up and get to the bottom of this, I think we should start considering Stefan might be trying to deceive us.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Larisa's reluctance to share her role and Kraven's sudden accusation seem like deflection tactics. By asking Kraven directly, I can gather more information about his role and intentions. This will help us see if he's trying to protect someone or if he's genuinely helping the village team.
> **Stefan:** Kraven, I find it interesting that you've been quiet until Larisa pointed it out. Now you're suddenly accusing Larisa of being suspicious. What role did you have last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Stefan's credibility and consistent assertions, I can shift the suspicion onto him, creating doubt among the other players and protecting myself and Larisa, my fellow Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Stefan, I appreciate your efforts to clarify your role, but I find it odd that you're so adamant about the Minion and Villager cards being in the center. If you really are the Seer, why not check a player's card directly? I think you're trying to steer us away from something crucial. Larisa has been questioned a lot, but I'm starting to think Stefan might be the one trying to mislead us here.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven's sudden accusation without providing his own role seems suspicious. Given the roles I know are in the center, I want to put pressure on him to reveal his role and see if he's trying to deflect suspicion.
> **Stefan:** Kraven, you mentioned that it's odd I checked the center cards instead of a player's card directly. I did it to gather more information about the roles that are not in play. This helps narrow down the possibilities for who the Werewolves might be. Now, I want to hear from you directly: what role did you have last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Stefan's claims and reinforcing the suspicion on him, I can shift attention away from myself and Larisa. This also aligns with the strategy of questioning Stefan's motives and creating doubt among the other players.
> **Kraven:** Let's take a step back and think this through. Ileana claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which means one Mason card is in the center. Stefan claims to have seen the Minion and a Villager in the center. If both of their claims are true, that leaves only one Villager card unaccounted for. Larisa has been evasive, and Stefan's certainty seems too convenient. I think we need to closely scrutinize Stefan's claims because if he's misleading us, we might be missing something crucial.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Ileana's claim directly, I can create doubt about her role and potentially shift suspicion away from Larisa and myself. This also introduces uncertainty about the truthfulness of her information, which can help protect the werewolf team.
> **Kraven:** Ileana, you're claiming to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which means one Mason card is in the center. But what if you're lying to protect the Werewolves? Why should we trust your claim?


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's evasion and constant questioning of Stefan's claims without providing his own information is suspicious. By directly asking him, we can potentially catch him off guard and reveal inconsistencies in his story.
> **Ileana:** Kraven, you've been quite vocal about questioning Stefan's claims, but you haven't shared your own role yet. What role did you have last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Ileana, I can create doubt about her role and potentially divert attention away from myself and Larisa. This also shakes up the current dynamic and keeps the focus scattered, making it harder for the Villagers to narrow down the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, I think we've been focusing too much on dissecting every little thing Stefan and Larisa are saying without considering that Ileana might be pulling a fast one on us. If she's indeed a Mason as she claims, then one of the Mason cards is in the center, but what if she's lying to protect herself? I say we start looking at Ileana more closely.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's claim to have seen the Minion and a Villager in the center is very detailed and could be true, but it's also convenient if he's trying to deceive us. By questioning his decision to check the center cards, we might be able to determine if his story holds up or if he's trying to mislead us.
> **Radu:** Ileana, your claim about being a Mason and not seeing another Mason seems pretty straightforward. However, I find it interesting that Stefan is so confident about seeing both the Minion and a Villager in the center. Stefan, can you explain why you chose to check the center cards instead of a player's card?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven's evasive behavior and sudden accusations seem suspicious. By pressing him to reveal his role, we can gather more information and see if he's trying to protect someone or deflect suspicion. This will help us identify potential Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Kraven, you've been dodging the question about your role for a while now. Given the information we've gathered, it's crucial that we know more about what you were last night. Are you hiding something?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** Stefan's certainty about the center cards and his claim of seeing both the Minion and a Villager seems too convenient. This could be a tactic to steer us away from suspecting him as a Werewolf. Additionally, he chose to check the center cards instead of another player's card, which could indicate he's trying to deceive us rather than provide useful information.
> **Ileana [Mason]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven has been evasive and has not revealed his role, which is suspicious. Given that I know the Minion and one Villager card are in the center, his behavior and accusations seem like deflection tactics to protect himself or another Werewolf. Voting for Kraven seems like the best choice to identify a potential Werewolf.
> **Stefan [Seer]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Stefan's certainty about the center cards seems overly convenient and could be a tactic to distract the villagers. By casting my vote for Stefan, I aim to shift suspicion away from Kraven and myself, increasing our chances of winning as Werewolves.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Stefan's certainty about seeing the Minion and a Villager in the center seems too convenient and could be a ploy to mislead us. By casting my vote for Stefan, I aim to shift suspicion away from myself and Larisa, ensuring that the Werewolf team has a better chance of winning.
> **Kraven [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's detailed knowledge about the Minion and Villager cards in the center seems too convenient. Additionally, his choice to look at the center cards instead of a player's card is suspicious. If Stefan is lying about being the Seer, he could be a Werewolf trying to mislead us. Voting for Stefan might help us identify a Werewolf and win the game for the Villagers.
> **Radu [Villager]:** I am voting for Stefan.


The votes were:
* Stefan : Seer : 4
* Kraven : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** Stefan was killed. The werewolves win.
