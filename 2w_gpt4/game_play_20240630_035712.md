## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** It's important to gather information from others to determine their roles. By asking Dragos directly, I can put him on the spot and hopefully catch inconsistencies. This will also divert attention away from myself and Kraven.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, we need to start piecing this puzzle together. Personally, I think we should hear from Dragos next. Dragos, what did you see or do last night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I don't have any night actions to describe. By being upfront about my role, I can help set the tone for an open and honest discussion. I'm hoping that by sharing my lack of information, it will encourage others to reveal useful information or catch them in a lie.
> **Dragos:** Alright, everyone, I've got nothing to hide. I'm just a simple Villager with no special abilities. But that also means I didn't see anything last night. I'm curious to hear what others have to say so we can piece this together.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia initiated the conversation, which could mean she has something to hide or is trying to steer the discussion. By asking her directly, I can gauge her reaction and gather more information to determine her role.
> **Dragos:** Alexia, since you started the questioning, I'm curious what you saw or did last night. Did you have any night actions or observations?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I align myself with Dragos, making my story consistent and less suspicious. Shifting the focus to Alexandra allows me to gather more information and see if there are any inconsistencies in her story, potentially identifying her role.
> **Alexia:** Alright Dragos, thanks for sharing. As for myself, I didn't see much last night because I happen to be a Villager as well. It's a bit frustrating since I don't have any special abilities or insights to offer. But I'm curious to hear from the rest of you so we can start putting the pieces together. Specifically, I think we should hear from Alexandra. Alexandra, did you have any night actions or observations?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia and Dragos both claiming to be Villagers could be a way to blend in and avoid suspicion. We need more information from those who might have had night actions.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let’s start piecing this together. I think it’s a bit suspicious that both Alexia and Dragos claim to be Villagers with no special abilities, making it harder for us to get concrete information. If there are any special roles out there, like a Seer, it would be really helpful for them to speak up.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** We need more information and Marius hasn't spoken yet. If he has any night actions or insights, it could help us validate the claims or expose a potential Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, since both Alexia and Dragos claim to be Villagers, it doesn't give us much to work with. But if we have any special roles like a Seer, now would be a great time to share any insights. Marius, have you got anything to add? Did you see or do anything last night?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** So far, Dragos and Alexia have both claimed to be Villagers, which doesn't give us any new information. Villagers can't help us identify the Werewolves directly, so we need input from special roles like the Seer to guide us.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, we've had a lot of people claiming to be Villagers, but that doesn't help us much. We need to hear from someone who might have more concrete information. If anyone is the Seer, now would be a great time to share what you saw last night. Otherwise, we might just be going in circles.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** So far, Dragos, Alexia, and I have all claimed to be Villagers, which doesn't give us any new information. Villagers can't help us identify the Werewolves directly, so we need input from special roles like the Seer to guide us.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, we've had a lot of people claiming to be Villagers, but that doesn't help us much. We need to hear from someone who might have more concrete information. If anyone is the Seer, now would be a great time to share what you saw last night. Otherwise, we might just be going in circles.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Since both Dragos and Alexia are claiming to be Villagers, it makes it harder to gather useful information. By casting suspicion on them, I aim to divert attention away from myself and Alexia, who is my fellow Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, I think it's really suspicious that both Dragos and Alexia are claiming to be Villagers with no special abilities. It's almost like they're trying to fly under the radar. We need to start considering the possibility that one of them might be a Werewolf. What do you all think about this?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the focus back to Kraven, I create a diversion from myself and Dragos, and put pressure on Kraven to provide information. This helps to deflect suspicion from me and my fellow Werewolf while keeping the conversation going in a new direction.
> **Alexia:** Kraven, you made a good point about Dragos and me claiming to be Villagers, but I think it's also worth noting that you've been pretty quiet up until now. If you're so concerned about us being Villagers, do you have any special role or abilities to share? Have you seen or done anything last night that can help us clear this up?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By urging anyone with a special role to speak up, I am trying to gather more information and potentially expose roles that could be threats to the Werewolves. This also diverts attention away from myself and Alexia.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, I've been thinking about this. We've got too many people claiming to be Villagers, which doesn't help us at all. If anyone has a special role, like a Seer or a Mason, this is the time to speak up. We can't afford to beat around the bush any longer. Someone needs to give us more concrete information!


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's sudden accusation and lack of concrete information seem like a deflection tactic. By questioning him directly, I can put pressure on him to reveal more and possibly catch him in a lie.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, I think Kraven's sudden shift in focus is a bit suspicious. He was quiet for most of the discussion, and now he's trying to cast doubt on me and Alexia. Kraven, you seem eager to accuse others, but you haven't given us any concrete information yourself. Why is that?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Marius, I aim to divert suspicion away from myself and Alexia. If Marius is pressured to reveal his role and he turns out to be a special role like Seer or Mason, it gives us more concrete targets to eliminate. This also keeps the conversation focused on someone else, reducing the chances of being discovered as a Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, I'm starting to think that Marius might be trying to stay in the background a bit too much. He keeps asking us to find someone with a special role but hasn't given us any information himself. Marius, if you're really a Villager, can you tell us why you're so insistent on others sharing their roles?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been quite vocal about other players without providing any concrete information about his own role. This could be a tactic to deflect attention from himself, so it's important to hear what he claims to have done last night.
> **Marius:** Kraven, you seem very eager to cast suspicion on everyone else but haven't given us any information about your own role. What did you do last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the focus towards Alexandra, I aim to divert attention away from myself and Alexia, while also putting pressure on another player who hasn't shared much concrete information. This could help us identify potential threats or at least keep the suspicion off us.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, it's interesting that Dragos and Alexia both claim to be Villagers. But what really intrigues me is that Alexandra hasn't given us much to go on. She has been quite vocal about needing special roles to speak up, but she hasn't really added any new information herself. Alexandra, could you please tell us more about what you did last night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's sudden shift in focus to accusing others without providing any real information about his own role is suspicious. We need to get more information from him to see if he's hiding something.
> **Alexandra:** Kraven, you've been very vocal about everyone else's roles but haven't given us any information about your own. What did you actually do last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the focus towards Alexandra and questioning her motives, I aim to divert attention away from myself and Alexia. This also puts pressure on Alexandra to reveal more information, potentially exposing her as a threat or at least keeping the suspicion off us.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, I find it very intriguing that Alexandra has been pushing for special roles to speak up but hasn't actually shared any concrete information herself. Given that both Dragos and Alexia are claiming to be Villagers, I think it's time we hear more from Alexandra. Alexandra, can you explain why you're so focused on others revealing their roles without giving us details about your own?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's behavior is consistent with someone trying to deflect suspicion away from themselves. By accusing multiple people without backing it up with solid information, he's attempting to sow confusion and mistrust. This is classic Werewolf behavior.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, I'm starting to get really suspicious of Kraven. He's been very vocal about doubting others, but hasn't given any concrete information about his own role. In fact, his sudden shift to accuse me without providing any new details is a classic deflection tactic. I strongly believe Kraven could be a Werewolf trying to throw us off!


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Alexandra, I aim to divert attention away from myself and Alexia. Alexandra has been pushing for others to reveal their roles but hasn't revealed much about herself. Keeping the focus on her will help keep suspicion off the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, I've been thinking about this a lot. We've got several people claiming to be Villagers, but we haven't heard anything concrete from Alexandra. She's been vocal about others needing to share their roles, but hasn't given us any real information about her own actions. I think it's crucial we get some clarity here.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's aggressive accusations without providing any concrete information make him highly suspicious. This could be a classic Werewolf tactic to deflect attention and sow confusion. It's crucial to get more information from Kraven to either validate his suspicions or expose him as a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Kraven, you've been very vocal about accusing others but haven't given us any solid information about your own role. What exactly did you do last night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Alexandra has been vocal about needing special roles to speak up without providing concrete information about her own role. This deflective behavior is suspicious and could indicate she is hiding something, possibly being a Villager trying to throw us off or even a special role that hasn't revealed yet. Voting for her could help identify her true role and shift attention away from myself and my fellow Werewolf, Kraven.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been very vocal about casting suspicion on others without providing any concrete information about his own role. His behavior is a classic deflection tactic, which makes me suspect he could be a Werewolf trying to throw us off. By voting for him, I hope to either catch him in a lie or force him to reveal more about his role.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven has been very vocal about casting suspicion on others without providing any concrete information about his own role. His behavior is consistent with someone trying to deflect attention and sow confusion, which is classic Werewolf behavior.
> **Alexandra [Mason]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been highly vocal and accusatory without providing any concrete information about his own role. This behavior is typical of someone trying to deflect attention away from themselves, which makes me suspicious that he could be a Werewolf or Minion. The other players, Alexia and Dragos, have consistently claimed to be Villagers, and although this isn't definitive, Kraven's aggressive accusations make him a more likely target.
> **Marius [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Alexandra has been vocal about others revealing their roles but hasn't provided any concrete information herself. This deflection makes her a prime suspect to divert attention from herself. By voting for Alexandra, we can shift suspicion away from the werewolves and potentially eliminate a villager, increasing our chances of winning.
> **Kraven [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


The votes were:
* Alexandra : Mason : 2
* Kraven : Werewolf : 3



>***GAME:*** Kraven was killed. The villagers win.
