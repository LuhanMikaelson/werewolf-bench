## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Mason, I align myself with the village team and create a plausible story that can't easily be countered unless someone else claims to be a Mason. This shifts suspicion away from me and Selene, the other Werewolf.
> **Semira:** I woke up as a Mason last night and I didn't see another Mason. This means the other Mason must be in the center cards. What do you all think about this?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I am trying to blend in with the majority of the players who might have less information and avoid drawing attention to myself. Additionally, questioning others might prompt them to reveal more useful information that I can use to my advantage.
> **Selene:** Well, if Semira is claiming to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, that means there might be a Mason card in the center. But we need to be careful because anyone could claim to be a Mason to avoid suspicion. Personally, I woke up as a Villager, and I have no special information from the night. Has anyone else seen anything suspicious or has any concrete information to share?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information from everyone to make an informed decision. Kraven hasn't said anything yet, so it's important to hear from him.
> **Mircea:** Kraven, do you have any information to share from last night? It's important that we all reveal our roles and night actions to find the Werewolves.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's immediate skepticism towards Semira's claim seems a bit suspicious to me. It could be a tactic to divert attention or create confusion. I want to see how she responds to being questioned.
> **Kraven:** Selene, you mentioned you woke up as a Villager and have no special information. But I'm curious, why did you immediately feel the need to clarify that anyone could claim to be a Mason? Are you trying to cast doubt on Semira's claim?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Kraven's curiosity, I am attempting to deflect suspicion from myself. Asking Mircea about their role might put them on the spot and possibly reveal more information that could be useful in identifying their true role, while also demonstrating my willingness to gather information.
> **Selene:** Kraven, I understand your curiosity, but I felt the need to point out that anyone could claim to be a Mason because it's a common tactic to blend in. My intention is to keep everyone cautious and ensure we’re all vetting each other's claims properly. That said, Mircea, you haven't shared your role yet. Could you tell us what you woke up as last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven hasn't revealed his role yet, and it's important to gather information from all players to make an informed decision. Also, his earlier questioning of Selene seemed a bit suspicious.
> **Mircea:** Kraven, you haven't shared your role yet. Could you let us know what role you woke up as?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's reluctance to reveal his role could be an indication that he has something to hide. Pressuring him to share his role might help us gather more information and identify any inconsistencies in the claims being made.
> **Kraven:** Mircea, you still haven't shared your role yet. It's important for us to gather as much information as possible, so please let us know what you woke up as last night.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been deflecting attention by questioning Selene and me without revealing his own role. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate he's trying to avoid being identified as a Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Kraven, you've been very evasive and haven't revealed your role at all. Are you trying to hide something? I'm starting to think you might be one of the Werewolves.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's reluctance to reveal his role might indicate that he has something to hide. Pressuring him to share his role will help us gather more information and identify any inconsistencies.
> **Kraven:** Mircea, you still haven't shared your role yet, and it's making me suspicious. It's crucial for us to be transparent if we're going to find the Werewolves. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** By questioning Selene on why she pointed out that anyone could claim to be a Mason right away, I hope to gather more information about her motivations and possibly reveal inconsistencies in her story. This could help in identifying if she's trying to deflect attention or cast doubt in a suspicious manner.
> **Mircea:** Selene, you've been quick to point out that anyone could claim to be a Mason, which is making me a bit suspicious of you. Why did you feel the need to bring that up so early?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Kraven's curiosity, I'm deflecting suspicion from myself and showing that I'm being cautious about false claims. Putting Mircea on the spot might reveal more useful information and also shows that I'm actively participating in the discussion. If Mircea is indeed withholding information, it could make them look more suspicious and take some heat off me and Semira.
> **Selene:** Kraven, I want to address your curiosity and clear things up. I felt it was important to point out that anyone could claim to be a Mason because we need to be cautious about false claims, especially early in the discussion. Now, Mircea, you've been quite evasive, and it's raising some red flags for me. We're all trying to gather as much information as possible, so could you please tell us what role you woke up as last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's evasive behavior and constant deflection without revealing his role make him a prime suspect. By pressing him to reveal his role, we can see if he slips up or tries to fabricate a story, which could help us identify him as a Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Kraven, I find it very suspicious that you keep deflecting and questioning others without revealing your own role. You're being evasive, and if we're going to find the Werewolves, we need transparency. So, Kraven, what role did you wake up as last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has been reluctant to share his role and keeps deflecting the conversation. Pressuring him to reveal his role might help expose inconsistencies or direct attention to other possible Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Mircea, you've been really evasive and deflecting attention towards me without revealing your own role. This seems very suspicious. Are you trying to hide something because you're a Werewolf?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's evasive behavior and constant deflection without revealing his role make him a prime suspect. By pressing him to reveal his role, we can see if he slips up or tries to fabricate a story, which could help us identify him as a Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Kraven, you've been avoiding revealing your role this entire time, and it's extremely suspicious. If we're going to figure out who the Werewolves are, we need to be transparent. What role did you wake up as last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's reluctance to share his role and his attempts to deflect suspicion onto me are classic tactics of someone trying to hide something. By pressuring him to reveal his role, we may uncover inconsistencies or gain more information to identify the Werewolves.

> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, I think Kraven's behavior is extremely suspicious. He keeps deflecting and avoiding revealing his role. This evasiveness makes me think he's hiding something. Kraven, it's time to stop deflecting and tell us what role you woke up as last night.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven has been extremely evasive and has deflected questions throughout the discussion. This behavior is highly suspicious and fits typical Werewolf tactics. Voting for Kraven is the best option to deflect suspicion from myself and Selene.
> **Semira [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven has been extremely evasive throughout the discussion and hasn't revealed his role, which is classic Werewolf behavior. His constant deflection and targeting of Mircea make him the most suspicious player. Voting for Kraven increases the chances of eliminating a potential threat to the Werewolves (me and Semira) and shifting attention away from us.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the discussion, Kraven has been extremely evasive, constantly questioning others without revealing his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of someone trying to hide something. Given the information we have, Kraven's actions make him the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Michael (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven has been extremely evasive and has not revealed his role despite repeated questioning. His deflective behavior is highly suspicious and fits the pattern of a Werewolf trying to avoid detection. Thus, voting for Kraven seems like the best option to protect the village.
> **Michael [Mason]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has been consistently evasive and deflecting questions, which is classic behavior of someone trying to hide their role. Since I am a Villager, I trust my own role and believe that pointing out Mircea's suspicious behavior aligns with trying to uncover the Werewolves. His reluctance to share his role and constant deflection make him the most suspicious player in this game.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Mircea.


The votes were:
* Mircea : Villager : 1
* Kraven : Villager : 4
