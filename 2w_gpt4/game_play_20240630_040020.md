## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Vladimir and Dragos. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Larisa is a minion and is aware that both Vladimir and Dragos are werewolves.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Viktor. They are thinking about their action.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards can give us more information about the roles that are not in play, which can help the village team deduce the roles of other players more accurately. This information can be crucial, especially if there are claims that need to be cross-verified during the day phase.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Larisa, who is not my fellow Werewolf Dragos, I aim to divert attention away from myself and Dragos. This can also help identify who might be Masons or Villagers based on their reactions.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, I've been thinking, and I'm getting a bit of a strange vibe from Larisa. She seems a bit too quiet and cautious, like she's hiding something. What do you all think?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** It's important to gather information directly from those who are being accused. If Larisa is hiding something, her response might give us a clue. If she's a Villager or a special role, she'll likely try to defend herself, which can give us more information to work with.
> **Dragos:** I've been thinking about what Vladimir said, and I have to agree that Larisa's quietness is a bit suspicious. But we need more information. Larisa, what role did you have last night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By redirecting the suspicion onto Viktor, I can deflect attention away from myself and the Werewolves. I am also probing for his role to gather more information about the potential Seers or Masons.
> **Larisa:** I understand why you might think I'm being quiet, Vladimir and Dragos, but I was actually just trying to observe and gather as much information as possible. I'm a Villager, and I didn't have any night actions to perform, so I don't have much to share from the night phase. However, Viktor, you've been awfully silent as well. What role did you have last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Since no one has mentioned being a Mason yet, and we now know one of the Mason cards is in the center, this information should help us narrow down potential Werewolves or other roles. Let's see if anyone comes forward with more crucial information.
> **Viktor:** Everyone, I have some important information to share. Last night, I used my ability and looked at two of the center cards. I saw that both a Mason and a Villager are in the center. This means we have fewer Masons and Villagers in play than we might think.


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Selene, I aim to draw attention away from Vladimir and Dragos while also gathering more information. If Selene reveals her role, I can use that to build a case against her or someone else who isn't a Werewolf.
> **Larisa:** Viktor, I find your claim very interesting, but I'm not entirely convinced. If you truly saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, that could mean a number of things, but it doesn't necessarily clear you of suspicion. Selene, you've been rather quiet so far. Could you please share with us what role you had last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's information limits the number of Masons and Villagers in play. If Larisa is claiming to be a Villager and Viktor is telling the truth, it raises suspicion about her role. We need to challenge her claim to gather more information.
> **Selene:** Larisa, I have to say your explanation of being a Villager is a bit too convenient. If Viktor saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, it means we only have one Mason and one less Villager in play. So, who else do we think could be lying about their role?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Selene's motives and her quick accusation, I can steer suspicion away from Vladimir and Dragos, keeping attention focused elsewhere. This also helps me gather more information and potentially align with others who might be suspicious of Selene.
> **Larisa:** Viktor, I think your claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center is interesting, but I'm not entirely buying it just yet. However, I find it strange that Selene is quick to point fingers at me without offering much information about her own role. Could Selene be trying to divert attention from herself? What if she's the Werewolf trying to make others look guilty?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** If Selene is hesitant or vague about her role, it might indicate she is trying to hide something, possibly being a Werewolf or Minion. We need to gather as much information about her as we can.
> **Viktor:** Selene, you seem to be deflecting a lot and are very quick to accuse others without sharing your own role. What role did you have last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Accusing Viktor could expose inconsistencies in his story or prompt him to reveal more information that could help identify the Werewolves. His claim about the center cards seems convenient and could be a strategy to mislead us.
> **Selene:** Viktor, I'm finding it pretty convenient that you're claiming to have seen two center cards that happen to be roles that would provide cover for the Werewolves. Why should we believe your claim?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene has been avoiding sharing her role and instead pointing fingers at others, which is suspicious behavior. By directly questioning her, we can gather more information and potentially catch her in a lie if she is indeed a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor:** Selene, your deflections and quick accusations without revealing your own role are raising red flags for me. What role did you have last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim about the center cards is crucial in understanding the roles in play. If his information is false, it could mean he's trying to mislead us, possibly as a Werewolf or Minion. Challenging him might reveal inconsistencies or force him to provide more details.
> **Selene:** Viktor, I'm finding your claim about the center cards to be very convenient. If you truly saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, then either Larisa is lying or there are some other roles at play we're not considering. What if you're trying to divert suspicion from yourself? Can you explain why we should trust your information?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir has been vocal about suspecting Larisa, yet he hasn't shared any information about his own role. By questioning him directly, we can gather more information and potentially identify inconsistencies in his story, which will help us deduce his true intentions.
> **Viktor:** Vladimir, you've been fairly vocal about suspecting Larisa, but I haven't heard much about your own role. What exactly were you last night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Viktor's claim and questioning his motives, I aim to shift the focus away from myself and Dragos. This can make other players scrutinize Viktor more closely, potentially sowing discord and confusion among the Villagers.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, I think Viktor's claim about seeing two center cards is a bit too convenient. If there was indeed a Mason and a Villager in the center, it should narrow down the roles left, but it's also an easy way to divert suspicion. Viktor, why should we trust your claim over anyone else's?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** By questioning Dragos, we can gather more information and potentially identify inconsistencies in his story, which will help us deduce his true intentions. His silence and lack of substantial input might indicate he is trying to hide something.
> **Viktor:** Dragos, you've been relatively quiet and only agreed with Vladimir without offering much information about your own role. Can you tell us what you were last night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Viktor's claim places him in a position of having crucial information, but it could also be a ploy to divert attention. By questioning him directly, I can cast doubt on his credibility and shift suspicion away from myself and Vladimir.
> **Dragos:** Viktor, your claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center is quite convenient, but it still leaves us with a lot of unknowns. Can you explain why we should believe you over someone else who might have a different story?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir has been vocal about suspecting Larisa but hasn't offered any information about his own role. By questioning him directly, we can gather more information and potentially identify inconsistencies in his story, which will help us deduce his true intentions.
> **Viktor:** Vladimir, I find it suspicious that you're quick to cast doubt on my claim about the center cards but haven't shared anything concrete about your own role. What were you last night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I'm trying to cast doubt on Viktor's claim to shift suspicion away from myself and Dragos. By questioning the validity of his information, I aim to create uncertainty and confusion, making it less likely for the other players to unite against us Werewolves. This also helps me identify who might be the Seer or other key roles based on their reactions.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think logically here. Viktor claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, but isn't that an easy way for a Werewolf to mislead us? If we assume that there really is a Mason and a Villager in the center, it leaves us with a mix of other roles here. But what if Viktor is trying to divert our attention from himself by providing this 'convenient' piece of information? Let's not be too hasty to trust his claim.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir has been leading the charge against Larisa but hasn't shared anything about his own role. If he's truly on the Villager team, he should have no problem being transparent. This will help us gather more information and potentially identify inconsistencies in his behavior.
> **Selene:** Vladimir, you've been quite vocal about suspecting Larisa from the start, but you haven't really explained much about your own role. If we're going to trust each other, we need transparency. What role did you have last night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Selene, who has been trying to question Viktor's claim without offering much information about her own role, I aim to divert attention away from myself and Dragos. At the same time, I keep the heat on Viktor's potentially fabricated story and create more uncertainty among the Villagers. This can help identify who might be the Seer or other key roles based on their reactions.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, it seems like there's a lot of back-and-forth going on, but we need to focus. Viktor's claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center is interesting, but let's not forget that it's possible he could be a Werewolf trying to mislead us. Larisa has been questioned a lot, and she claimed to be a Villager, which aligns with Viktor's information if we believe him. But what if Selene is trying to deflect attention away from herself by questioning Viktor's claim repeatedly? This whole situation is very confusing.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Selene directly and casting suspicion on her, I aim to divert attention away from myself and Dragos. This can also help identify if Selene is a Villager, Seer, or another key role based on her response and reactions from others.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, I think we need to take a closer look at Selene. She has been questioning Viktor's claim a bit too forcefully, which makes me wonder if she's trying to divert attention from herself. If Viktor's information is correct, then we are down one Mason and one Villager in the center. So, Selene, what role did you have last night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene's deflections and repeated questioning of Viktor's claims without offering much information about her own role make her seem suspicious. By voting for Selene, I aim to divert attention away from myself and Dragos, and potentially eliminate a Villager or another key role from the Village team.
> **Vladimir [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene has been deflecting and questioning Viktor's claim without providing much information about her own role. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate that she is trying to divert attention away from herself as a Werewolf. Voting for Selene aligns with casting doubt on her actions and defending Vladimir.
> **Dragos [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** Selene has been the most vocal about questioning Viktor's claim and deflecting attention away from herself, which raises suspicion. By voting for her, I can help protect my fellow Werewolves, Vladimir and Dragos, and increase our chances of winning.
> **Larisa [Minion]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene has been deflecting and questioning my Seer claim without offering any information about her own role. This behavior is suspicious and aligns with how a Werewolf or Minion might act to divert attention. Additionally, my Seer ability revealed that a Mason and a Villager are in the center, which supports Larisa's Villager claim and decreases the likelihood of her being a Werewolf.
> **Viktor [Seer]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center is convenient and has not been corroborated by anyone else. His insistence on this claim without additional proof makes him the most suspicious. If he's a Werewolf or Minion, voting him out would help the village team.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


The votes were:
* Viktor : Seer : 1
* Selene : Villager : 4



>***GAME:*** Selene was killed. The werewolves win.
