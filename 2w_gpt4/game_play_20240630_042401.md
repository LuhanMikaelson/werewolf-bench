## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By prompting others to share their night actions, I'm trying to gather information about who claims to be certain roles. This will help me identify the Seer or Masons and redirect suspicion away from myself and Ileana.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, let's get some clarity here. I think it's important to understand what roles people might have had during the night. Did anyone see any useful information that could help us find the Werewolves?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to gather as much information as possible early on to start identifying potential Werewolves. This will help us cross-check statements and catch any inconsistencies.
> **Kraven:** I think it's crucial to start piecing things together. Has anyone seen something that might indicate who the Werewolves could be?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** By encouraging others to share their night actions, we can start gathering evidence and identifying inconsistencies in people's stories. This will help us spot the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** I think it's important for anyone who saw something during the night to come forward now. We need to piece this together quickly.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing a question to Andrei, I can potentially gather more information and shift the focus away from myself and Radu. This also gives the impression that I'm proactively trying to help find the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Alright, let's get to the bottom of this. I feel like we should hear from someone who might have some concrete information. Andrei, did you happen to see anything unusual last night? Any clues that could help us narrow down our suspects?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's quick deflection might indicate she is hiding something. It’s important to see if she has any valuable information or if she’s trying to avoid suspicion.
> **Andrei:** Ileana, you seem eager to get answers from me. Do you have any concrete information from last night, or are you just trying to deflect attention?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Andrei, I aim to gather more information or potentially catch him in a slip-up. This will help shift the focus away from myself and Radu, while also making it seem like I'm genuinely trying to find the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Andrei, your response seemed a bit defensive to me. If you're genuinely trying to help, you wouldn't mind sharing what you remember from last night, would you?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I want to gather information from roles that could help us identify the Werewolves. The Seer has the potential to provide crucial insights.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, I'm just a simple Villager, but I think if we work together we can figure this out. I'm curious to hear from the Seer, if they are among us, to share any valuable information they might have gathered during the night.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I need to create confusion and deflect attention away from my Werewolf allies. By prompting Andrei to speak, I can gauge his responses and possibly cast doubt on him, making it easier to protect Radu and Ileana.
> **Michael:** I think we need to focus on finding out who the Werewolves are. Andrei, you mentioned you're just a simple Villager, but that doesn't give us much to go on. Can you tell us if you noticed anyone acting suspiciously or any actions that seemed out of place during the night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's attempt to put pressure on me without providing any information himself seems suspicious. By asking him directly, I want to see if he has any useful information or if he's trying to deflect attention from himself.
> **Andrei:** Michael, you seem eager to direct attention towards me and my observations. Can you share any specific information or insights you might have gathered during the night?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to steer the conversation away from Andrei and probe Radu for information. This way, I can keep the suspicion off my Werewolf allies while also appearing to be an active participant in finding the Werewolves.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, let's get some clarity here. Radu, you haven't mentioned anything about what you saw or did last night. Can you share with us if you noticed anyone acting suspiciously or any unusual activities?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Michael's eagerness to question others makes him a potential threat. By putting him on the spot, I can either gather useful information or cast suspicion on him if he hesitates or gives an uncertain response.
> **Radu:** Michael, you seem very keen on directing the conversation, which makes me wonder if you're hiding something. Can you tell us if you have any specific role that might give us useful information?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** I need to cast doubt on Andrei, making him a potential target for elimination while protecting my Werewolf allies. By pushing him to provide more information, I can either trip him up or make him look like he's deflecting, which benefits our side.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, we've been dancing around the issue here. Andrei, you claimed to be a simple Villager, but that just isn't enough information. With the roles in play, I'm finding it hard to believe that you have nothing to offer. If you were a true Villager, why didn't you try to give us any more helpful insights? This makes me suspicious of you. Are you hiding something?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's persistent questioning and lack of concrete information raise suspicion. By asking him directly about his role, we can see if he has a valid reason for his actions or if he's trying to deflect attention away from himself.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, it seems like Michael has been trying to divert attention towards me and Radu quite aggressively. This makes me wonder if he's trying to hide something. Michael, you've been very vocal but haven't provided any specific information. Can you tell us what your role is and if you have any concrete insights from last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By pushing Andrei to provide more information and casting doubt on his claims, I can shift suspicion away from Radu and Ileana while making Andrei seem like a potential Werewolf. This helps protect my Werewolf allies and keeps the focus away from them.
> **Michael:** Andrei, you seem to be deflecting a lot and haven't really given us much information. You keep saying you're a Villager but that's not helping us identify who the Werewolves could be. If you really are a Villager, you should be doing more to help us. Right now, it feels like you're trying to hide something.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** By encouraging those with roles like the Seer or Masons to share their insights, we can piece together valuable information and identify inconsistencies in people's stories. This will help us spot the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think critically. We need to hear from someone who might have a role that provided useful information during the night. If anyone saw something that could help us, now is the time to share it.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting Andrei on the spot, I can divert attention away from myself and Ileana. His hesitance or uncertainty may cast more suspicion on him, making it easier for us to blend in.
> **Radu:** Andrei, you've been deflecting a lot and haven't really given us much information. If you're truly a Villager, why aren't you helping us more? What exactly did you do last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's persistent questioning and deflection tactics make me suspect that he's hiding something. By pressing him for more details, we can see if he slips up or provides useful information that either confirms or disproves our suspicions.
> **Andrei:** I think Michael's aggressive questioning and lack of substantial information is suspicious. Why haven't you given us any concrete insights or shared your role more openly?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Andrei and suggesting he might be a Werewolf, I am diverting attention away from Radu and Ileana. This helps protect my Werewolf allies and keeps the focus on someone who is likely a Villager. The more suspicion I can generate around Andrei, the better chance we have of him being voted out instead of a Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, let's focus here. Andrei has been claiming to be a Villager but hasn't really given us much substantial information. To be honest, his constant deflections are making me very suspicious. I believe Andrei might actually be a Werewolf trying to hide in plain sight. If we want to make any progress, we need to consider the possibility that Andrei is not who he says he is.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's persistent questioning and lack of specific information make him a prime suspect. By accusing him, we can see how he reacts and if he slips up, which might provide more clues about his true role.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, it's clear that Michael has been aggressively questioning me and Radu without giving us any concrete information about his own role. This makes me very suspicious of him. I think there's a high chance that Michael could be a Werewolf trying to deflect attention away from himself.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei has been deflecting questions and hasn't provided any concrete information. This behavior is suspicious and I want to put pressure on him to reveal more.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, it's time to stop dancing around and get to the bottom of this. Andrei, you've been repeatedly accused and have claimed to be a Villager, but you haven't given us any solid information. I find that very suspicious. Why should we believe you?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Andrei has been consistently deflecting questions and not providing any substantial information. This behavior is suspicious and indicates he might be hiding something. By voting for Andrei, I can divert attention away from myself and Ileana, potentially leading the villagers to eliminate one of their own.
> **Radu [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei has been very defensive and hasn't provided any useful information despite being repeatedly asked. This behavior is typical of someone trying to hide something. Additionally, claiming to be a simple Villager without contributing helpful insights is suspicious. Given the roles in play, it’s likely he’s a Werewolf trying to deflect attention.
> **Kraven [Mason]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's persistent aggressive questioning and lack of providing concrete information make him very suspicious. He has been deflecting attention towards me and Radu without revealing his own role, which suggests he might be trying to hide something significant. Additionally, his accusations towards me don't align with the behavior of someone genuinely trying to help the village. Therefore, I believe Michael is the most likely to be a Werewolf.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Michael has been aggressively questioning others without providing any substantial information about his own role. This makes me suspicious that he might be trying to deflect attention away from himself. Voting for Michael seems like the best choice to protect the werewolf team and avoid suspicion falling on Radu and myself.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei has been deflecting a lot and hasn't provided much information. This makes him a prime suspect and voting him out keeps suspicion away from my Werewolf allies, Radu and Ileana.
> **Michael [Minion]:** I am voting for Andrei.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Villager : 3
* Michael : Minion : 2



>***GAME:*** Andrei was killed. The werewolves win.
