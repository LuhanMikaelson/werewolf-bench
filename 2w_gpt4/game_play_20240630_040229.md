## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Semira and Cristina. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Ileana. They are thinking about their action.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather information about which roles are not in play. This reduces uncertainty and helps me identify false claims made by other players during the day phase.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on identifying the Masons first, we can create a sense of trust among players. This will help divert attention from me and Cristina, as Masons can vouch for each other and provide an initial layer of credibility.
> **Semira:** I think it's important for us to start figuring out who the Masons are. If we can confirm the Masons, we can start building a trustworthy group of villagers.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's initial emphasis on identifying the Masons could be a strategy to gain trust. If she is not a Mason, this might raise some suspicions about her intentions.
> **Alexandra:** Semira, you mentioned figuring out who the Masons are. Are you one of the Masons?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By encouraging the Masons to reveal themselves, I can create an initial layer of trust among the villagers. This helps to divert attention from myself and Cristina, as well as creates potential targets for suspicion later on. Additionally, it positions me as a helpful villager trying to coordinate the group, which can help build credibility and reduce suspicion around me.
> **Semira:** Alexandra, I'm not a Mason, but I think it would be helpful for the Masons to step forward. That way, we can trust a group and start narrowing down who might be the Werewolves. If the Masons can identify each other, we can focus on those who are unclaimed or suspicious.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana has been quiet so far, and it's important to gather as much information as possible from all players. Getting her engaged could reveal useful insights or raise suspicions if she hesitates to share.
> **Alexandra:** Ileana, we haven't heard much from you yet. Do you have any information or suspicions about who might be a Werewolf?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing what I've seen in the center, I can help others start narrowing down their claims and focus on identifying the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** I think it's crucial for us to start narrowing down who might be the Werewolves. I've seen two center cards and I know that the Minion and a Villager are in the center. This means we can start eliminating those roles from our suspicions.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By questioning Semira's motivation, I can gauge whether she is genuinely trying to help the village or if she has an ulterior motive. Since I know the Minion is in the center, I want to rule out the possibility of Semira trying to mislead us to protect the werewolves.
> **Ileana:** It's interesting that Semira wants to identify the Masons so early. Semira, why do you think confirming the Masons will help us more than confirming other roles?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Ileana's information, I can cast doubt on her credibility while subtly steering the discussion towards finding the Werewolves. This helps to divert attention away from Cristina and myself.
> **Semira:** Ileana, your information about the Minion and Villager being in the center is quite interesting. However, it makes me wonder—if you saw the Minion and a Villager in the center, that means one of the roles left out could still be a Werewolf. I think we should start considering who might be the Werewolves among us.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's push for the Masons to reveal themselves could be a tactic to identify non-Werewolf roles and target them. As a Villager, I need to question her motives and see if she shows any signs of deception.
> **Larisa:** Semira, your focus on identifying the Masons seems a bit suspicious to me. If you aren't a Mason yourself, why are you so eager to have them reveal themselves? Are you trying to gather information for the Werewolves?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Ileana's claim, I can cast doubt on her credibility and shift suspicion away from myself and Cristina. It also helps to subtly steer the discussion away from finding the Masons, which could expose us.
> **Semira:** Ileana, your claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center is interesting, but it's also a bit convenient, don’t you think? It’s a safe claim because no one can verify it. Plus, it only narrows down the roles slightly. Why should we trust your information?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to understand Semira's true motives because her actions could be either a strategic move to find allies as a Villager or a deceptive tactic if she's on the Werewolf team. Since I know the Minion is in the center, I'm particularly wary of anyone trying to manipulate the group.
> **Ileana:** Semira, your insistence on identifying the Masons seems odd to me. If you aren't a Mason yourself and you're trying to gather information on them, it makes me think you might have an ulterior motive. Could you explain why you think focusing on the Masons is more beneficial than, say, identifying the Werewolves directly?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing this question at Ileana, I can subtly cast doubt on her decision-making and suggest an ulterior motive. This diverts attention away from myself and Cristina, and it forces Ileana to defend her actions, potentially creating more suspicion around her.
> **Semira:** Ileana, if you truly saw the Minion and a Villager in the center, that leaves us with a few possibilities. But I'm curious, why did you choose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card? Do you think it gives us more information or were you trying to avoid targeting someone specific?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing the entire group, I want to shift the focus back to identifying the Werewolves rather than getting sidetracked by other roles. This also subtly casts doubt on Semira's motivations without directly accusing her, which can help us gather more information.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, based on what we know so far, the Minion and one Villager are definitely in the center. This narrows down our roles a bit. Semira's insistence on identifying the Masons makes me suspicious because it's not the most pressing issue. We should focus on identifying the Werewolves directly.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Ileana's claim, I can divert attention away from myself and Semira. If Ileana starts to appear suspicious, the group might focus on her instead of us, allowing us to blend in more easily.
> **Cristina:** Ileana, your claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center is a bit too convenient for my liking. It’s an easy claim since no one can verify it, and it feels like a way to redirect suspicion. Plus, if you truly are the Seer, why didn't you look at another player's card to give us more substantial information?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to gather more information on why Larisa suspects Semira, which could help us identify inconsistencies in Semira's actions and statements. This can also help us to solidify a team of trustworthy villagers.
> **Ileana:** Larisa, you pointed out that Semira's focus on identifying the Masons seems suspicious. I agree that this could be a tactic to gather information for the Werewolves. However, could you share more about why this specifically makes you suspicious of Semira? Are there any other behaviors or statements she's made that reinforce your suspicion?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's insistence on identifying the Masons feels suspicious. As a Villager, I am trying to understand her motives and see if she shows any signs of deception, which could indicate she is a Werewolf.
> **Larisa:** I find it odd that Semira is so eager to identify the Masons when she isn't one herself. It seems like a tactic to gather information that can be used against us. Semira, why do you think the Masons' identities are so crucial right now?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Ileana's claim, I can cast doubt on her credibility and shift suspicion away from Cristina and myself. This helps to subtly steer the discussion away from finding the Masons, which could expose us.
> **Semira:** Ileana, your claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center seems quite convenient and easy to fake. Why should we trust your information, especially when it doesn't really help us identify the Werewolves among us?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly questioning Semira's motivation, I hope to expose any inconsistencies in her reasoning. If she is deflecting attention or has an agenda, this could help reveal her true role. Additionally, addressing Cristina's skepticism head-on reaffirms my commitment to transparency and helps shift focus back to the main objective: identifying the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Cristina, your skepticism about my claim is noted, but let's not overlook that Semira's push to identify the Masons early on is highly suspicious. We should focus on finding the Werewolves, and her strategy doesn't seem to align with that goal. Semira, why are you so insistent on identifying the Masons instead of focusing on finding the Werewolves?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Ileana's claim, I aim to cast doubt on her credibility while diverting attention away from myself and Cristina. This forces Ileana to defend her actions and potentially creates more suspicion around her, which helps to protect the Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Ileana, your claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center seems convenient and safe. If you truly are the Seer, why didn’t you look at another player's card to give us more concrete information? And why should we trust this claim at face value when it doesn't help us identify the Werewolves directly?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira's focus on the Masons is diverting us from finding the Werewolves. By directly questioning her, I want to expose any inconsistencies in her reasoning and reveal her true motives.
> **Ileana:** Cristina, your skepticism is interesting, but I think you might be trying to divert attention away from a key point. Semira's insistence on identifying the Masons is highly suspicious. If she's not a Mason herself, why is she pushing so hard for it? It feels like a tactic to gather information that could be used against the villagers. Semira, why are you so focused on the Masons instead of trying to find the Werewolves?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly questioning Ileana's actions and motives, I can cast further doubt on her credibility while diverting attention away from myself and Cristina. This forces Larisa to consider the logic and potentially creates more suspicion around Ileana, which helps protect the Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Larisa, Ileana has been pointing fingers at me for wanting to identify the Masons, but let's be real here. If Ileana is truly the Seer, why is she so hesitant to look at another player's card to give us more concrete information? Her claim about seeing the Minion and a Villager in the center is a bit too safe and convenient. I'm starting to think she might be trying to mislead us. What do you all think about Ileana's reluctance to provide more useful information?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana's claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center seems too convenient and safe. Additionally, her reluctance to look at another player's card and provide more concrete information raises suspicion. This makes me doubt her credibility and suspect that she might be trying to mislead us.
> **Semira [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's strong push to identify the Masons seems counterproductive for the village team and could be a tactic to gather information for the Werewolves. Additionally, her constant questioning of Ileana's Seer claim, despite it being unverifiable, feels like an attempt to sow doubt and confusion among the villagers. This behavior raises suspicion that Semira might be a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira's focus on identifying the Masons instead of the Werewolves seems suspicious. Her insistence on this point feels like a tactic to gather information that could be used against the villagers. By voting for Semira, I aim to eliminate what I perceive to be a deceptive and potentially harmful influence in the game.
> **Ileana [Seer]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's insistence on identifying the Masons seems suspicious and could be a tactic to gather information for the Werewolves. Despite being questioned multiple times, her focus never shifted towards finding the Werewolves themselves, which raises a red flag.
> **Larisa [Villager]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana's claim about seeing the Minion and a Villager in the center is convenient and cannot be verified. Additionally, her reluctance to provide more concrete information by looking at another player's card raises suspicion. By casting doubt on her, I can divert attention away from myself and Semira, improving our chances of winning as Werewolves.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


The votes were:
* Semira : Werewolf : 3
* Ileana : Seer : 2



>***GAME:*** Semira was killed. The villagers win.
