## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Since I'm a Villager, I want to quickly identify our allies. If the Masons can confirm each other, we can start trusting them and focus our attention on finding the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Hey everyone, I think we should start by asking if any of the Masons can confirm each other. If we have two confirmations from the Mason group, it will help us narrow down who might be the Werewolves.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** If the Seer reveals themselves, it will give me and Dragos a chance to discredit them or redirect suspicion. Plus, it helps us identify who might be trustworthy to target later.
> **Stefan:** Alright, let's try to narrow things down a bit. I think it might be useful if the Seer could come forward and share any information they have. It could really help us figure out if there are any Werewolves among us.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By encouraging the Masons to confirm each other, we can create a sense of trust and misdirect suspicion away from myself and Stefan, allowing us to better identify and target Villagers or the Seer.
> **Dragos:** I think we should be cautious about rushing into accusations without more information. If there are any Masons, it would really help if they could confirm each other now. This way, we can start narrowing down the possibilities.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos's hesitation could be a strategy to avoid drawing attention to himself if he is a Werewolf. By asking him directly, we might catch him in a lie or get more useful information.
> **Emil:** Alright, I feel like it's time to get things moving. Dragos, you seem very cautious about not accusing anyone. Why don't you tell us what role you have and why you're so hesitant?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I can blend in without drawing too much attention. Turning the question back to Emil might shift the spotlight and reveal more information.
> **Dragos:** Alright Emil, fair enough. I’ll come clean - I’m a Villager. Villagers don’t have any special abilities, but we’re definitely not Werewolves. My caution is because I don’t want to make baseless accusations and end up losing a valuable Villager by mistake. Now, what about you? What role are you claiming?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** By directing the question to Stefan, who initiated the idea of the Seer coming forward, we can either get valuable information or expose if he's stalling. This will help us narrow down potential Werewolves or allies.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, I think it's time to step up and share my thoughts. Given that Dragos claims to be a Villager, we should take his caution into account. But let's hear more from others before jumping to conclusions. Stefan, you suggested that the Seer should come forward. Do you have any information to share, or are you waiting for someone else to reveal something?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing suspicion towards Viktor, I can create some doubt about his motives and potentially steer attention away from me and Dragos. This also keeps the conversation active and keeps the focus on others, which is beneficial for us as Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Alright Emil, I see your point. But you know what, something just doesn't sit right with me about Viktor. He's very quick to suggest the Masons reveal themselves but is not stepping forward with any information himself. Viktor, you seem a bit too eager to get the Masons talking. Are you trying to deflect suspicion from yourself?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to gather more information from players who haven't spoken much yet. Marius hasn't revealed anything, and it's vital to hear his role to piece together our next moves.
> **Viktor:** Alright Stefan, I see your point, but let's not jump to conclusions based on caution alone. I would really like to hear from Marius next. What role are you claiming, Marius?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** By getting the Masons to confirm each other, we can reduce the number of unknown variables and potentially identify who the Werewolves are. Dragos's claim as a Villager aligns with my own role, but we need more information to make a sound decision.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, here's my thought. Since Dragos has already claimed to be a Villager, and we're not getting much clarity from the others, I think it's time for the Masons to step forward and confirm each other. This way, we can either clear some people or start focusing our attention on others.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's suggestion for the Seer to come forward could be an attempt to draw attention away from himself. Since he hasn't provided any information yet, it's important to press him for his role to see if he's hiding something.
> **Marius:** Stefan, you suggested that the Seer should come forward, but you haven't revealed your own role yet. What's your role, and do you have any information that could help us identify the Werewolves?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Emil, I can redirect attention away from myself and Dragos. This keeps the focus on others and adds to the confusion, making it harder for the Villagers to identify the real Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Alright Marius, you make a fair point and I understand why you'd want more information. But before we get too far, something feels off about Emil. He's been a bit too quick to support Dragos's claim without much evidence. Emil, why are you so eager to defend Dragos? Are you hiding something?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's eagerness to flush out the Masons without providing any information himself is suspicious. He might be trying to protect the Werewolves by making the Masons reveal themselves early.
> **Emil:** Let's get things straight here. Viktor, you've been very eager to get the Masons talking without revealing anything about yourself. I'm starting to think you're hiding something. Are you the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been deflecting and trying to accuse me without solid evidence. It's worth pressing him more to see if he slips up or reveals something useful.
> **Viktor:** Alright Emil, you've been very quick to point fingers at me and defend Dragos. That makes me suspicious. Are you hiding something? Are you possibly the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's eagerness to flush out the Masons without revealing anything about himself is highly suspicious. He might be trying to protect the Werewolves by making the Masons reveal themselves early. By questioning him directly, we might be able to catch him in a lie or reveal his true intentions.
> **Emil:** Let's cut to the chase. Viktor, you've been pushing for the Masons to reveal themselves without offering any information about your own role. This makes me suspicious of you. Why are you so eager for the Masons to reveal themselves? Are you hiding something, like being the Minion or a Werewolf?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been encouraging others to reveal their roles without sharing his own, which is suspicious. If he’s a Villager, he should be transparent. If he’s a Werewolf or Minion, we might catch him in a lie.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, it's time we get serious here. Marius, you've been pushing for the Masons to reveal themselves but haven't given any solid information about your own role. Why don't you tell us what role you have?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** By having the Masons confirm each other, we can reduce the uncertainty and start identifying who might be the Werewolves. This will help us make a more informed decision when it comes to voting.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's get serious here. We've been going in circles without getting much concrete information. Dragos and I have both claimed to be Villagers. The Masons need to step forward now to help us gather more information and clear some names. This way, we can either confirm their roles or start focusing on the others who haven't provided any solid information.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil and Marius have been pressing others to reveal their roles while not providing much about their own. This behavior is typical of someone trying to deflect attention away from themselves. If they were truly Villagers, they would be more transparent.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, I think we need to focus on who hasn't been giving us clear information. Emil and Marius have been doing a lot of talking without providing any solid information about their roles. This makes me very suspicious of them.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing suspicion towards Emil, I can further shift focus away from myself and Dragos. This makes Emil look more suspicious and keeps the attention on others, which is beneficial for us as Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Alright Emil, you've been very quick to accuse Viktor and support Dragos without much hesitation. Why are you so eager to point fingers without clear evidence? Are you trying to cover something up?


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Stefan's been deflecting and accusing without revealing his own role. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate he's trying to protect himself as a Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Listen up everyone! There's something fishy going on here. Stefan, you're quick to point fingers at me and Viktor without providing any solid information about your own role. Why are you trying to divert attention? Are you hiding something, like being a Werewolf?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly accusing Emil, I can redirect the focus away from myself and Dragos. This adds to the confusion and makes Emil look more suspicious, which is beneficial for us as Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, let's focus here. Emil, you're being very vocal and quick to point fingers at Viktor and myself. This makes me really suspicious of you. I think you're trying to divert attention away from yourself. Why are you so defensive, Emil? What are you hiding?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been very vocal and quick to point fingers at multiple players without providing solid information about his own role. His behavior seems suspicious and aligns with someone trying to deflect attention away from themselves. Voting for Emil seems like the best choice to uncover his true role and potentially identify a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil has been very vocal and quick to accuse others without providing solid information about his own role. He also supported Dragos's claim without much hesitation, which raises suspicion. By voting for Emil, I can redirect focus away from myself and Dragos and add to the confusion, making it harder for the Villagers to identify the real Werewolves.
> **Stefan [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil has been very vocal and quick to accuse others, especially Viktor and Stefan, without providing solid information about his own role. This makes him the most suspicious in my eyes, and targeting him could help divert suspicion away from myself and Stefan.
> **Dragos [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been very eager to get the Masons to reveal themselves without providing any solid information about his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and makes me think he could be the Minion or a Werewolf trying to protect himself.
> **Emil [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan has been deflecting questions and trying to divert attention away from himself throughout the discussion. He also hasn't provided any solid information about his role, making him the most suspicious in my eyes.
> **Marius [Villager]:** I am voting for Stefan.


The votes were:
* Viktor : Villager : 1
