## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Dragos and Alexia. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Lucian. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Marius. They are thinking about their action.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can potentially identify if any Werewolf or other important roles are unassigned, which will help me narrow down the possibilities and create a strong argument during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Starting with a claim of being a Villager is a safe move. It’s a common role and doesn't attract too much suspicion. By asking others to share their roles, I can gather more information and see if anyone makes a suspicious claim that I can use to my advantage.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's start sharing information. I’ll go first: I’m a Villager. What about you all?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Since Dragos claimed to be a Villager, asking Lucian directly will help me gather information and see if there's any inconsistency in the claims being made. This could potentially help me deflect suspicion and identify threats to the werewolf team.
> **Alexia:** Alright, I'll go next. I think it's important to get some clarity from everyone. I woke up as a Villager, so I'm just trying to piece together what everyone's roles are. Lucian, what role did you wake up with?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Revealing my role as a Mason will help build trust and narrow down the possible roles for the other players. By mentioning the Seer, I encourage the Seer to step forward or others to help identify them.
> **Lucian:** Sure, I'll share. I woke up as a Mason. Since I'm the only one, I know the other Mason card is in the center. This means we still have a Seer out there who can help us get more clarity.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to gather as much information as possible to identify the Werewolves, and everyone needs to contribute. Kraven's response will help us piece together more of the puzzle.
> **Lucian:** Kraven, you haven't spoken up yet. What's your role?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather all the initial claims to start piecing together the information and identify any inconsistencies or suspicious behaviors.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, I'll chime in now. I woke up as a Villager, just like Dragos and Alexia claimed. So far, we have two people claiming Villager, and Lucian claiming Mason. Marius, we haven't heard from you yet. What role did you wake up with?


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing my role and the cards I saw in the center, I can help the village team identify lies and narrow down the potential werewolves. Lucian's false claim of being a Mason casts significant suspicion on him, potentially identifying him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Marius:** I have some important information to share. I am the Seer, and during the night, I looked at two of the center cards. I saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. This means Lucian's claim of being a Mason is false, as both Mason cards are accounted for in the center!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius provided specific information about the center cards that directly contradicts Lucian's claim of being a Mason. This discrepancy needs to be addressed immediately to identify who might be lying, and potentially a Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Hold on, Marius. You claim to be the Seer and saw both a Mason and a Villager in the center. This contradicts Lucian's claim of being a Mason. If Lucian is lying, that's highly suspicious. Lucian, can you explain why you're claiming to be a Mason when Marius saw both Masons in the center?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Given that I know I'm the Mason and the other Mason card is in the center, Marius's claim throws suspicion on him. By challenging his story, we can gather more responses and piece together more accurate information.
> **Lucian:** Marius, your claim doesn't add up. If you truly were the Seer and saw two center cards as you stated, why would there be a contradiction with my claim? One of us is clearly lying, and from my perspective, it's you. Let's hear if anyone else has more information to back this up.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly confronting Lucian and pointing out the inconsistency in his claim, we can force him to either explain himself or potentially expose his role as a Werewolf or Minion. Given that I have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, Lucian's claim doesn't add up and casts considerable doubt on his honesty.
> **Marius:** Lucian, your claim to be a Mason is very suspicious since I saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Why would you lie about being a Mason?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** I know for a fact that I'm the Mason, which means Marius's claim to be the Seer must be false. By directly challenging Marius's statement, we can put pressure on him to either reveal more information or expose inconsistencies in his story, which could help us identify the real Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Marius, your claim to be the Seer and having seen both a Mason and a Villager in the center is highly suspicious. Considering I am the Mason, there's no way you could have seen both Masons in the center. Either you're lying, or someone else is. We need to figure this out.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have seen the Mason and Villager in the center, and Lucian's false claim of being a Mason is highly suspicious. This contradiction needs to be addressed, and it points towards Lucian being on the Werewolf team.
> **Marius:** Lucian, your story doesn't add up. If you were truly a Mason, you wouldn't claim to be the only one when I saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. This means either you're lying or you're mistaken. I accuse you of being a Werewolf or Minion!


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to gather more details from all players to piece together the information. Since Dragos has only made a quick claim and hasn't contributed much, pressing him for more information may reveal inconsistencies or confirm his role.
> **Lucian:** Dragos, you've been quiet after your initial claim of being a Villager. Can you provide more details to support your claim? Did you witness anything during the night or have any suspicions?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Marius's claim and suggesting that he might be the Minion, I can cast doubt on his revelation and redirect suspicion away from myself and Alexia. This also sows discord among the Villagers, making it harder for them to come to a consensus.
> **Dragos:** Marius, your claim to be the Seer and saying you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center is quite bold. But let's think about this logically. If you were truly the Seer and saw those cards, why would Lucian claim to be a Mason? There's a lot of confusion here. I think it's possible that Marius is trying to throw us off. Maybe Marius is the Minion trying to help the Werewolves.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to gather more information and keep the pressure on other players. Dragos has been relatively quiet since his initial Villager claim, so pushing him for more details might reveal inconsistencies or provide additional clues.
> **Marius:** Dragos, your claim of being a Villager hasn't been thoroughly examined yet. Can you give us more details or any suspicions you might have?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Marius's claim and suggesting he might be the Minion, I can cast doubt on his information and redirect suspicion away from myself and Alexia. This creates more confusion and discord among the Villagers.
> **Dragos:** Marius, I have to say, your claim to be the Seer and having seen a Mason and a Villager in the center is very suspicious. Lucian has been quite consistent with his claim of being a Mason. It feels like you're trying to confuse us. Are you sure you're not the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves?


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexia's claim of being a Villager hasn't been thoroughly examined yet. By pushing her for more details or any suspicions she might have, we might uncover inconsistencies or gain additional clues that can help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Alexia, you've been relatively quiet after claiming to be a Villager. Can you provide any more details or suspicions based on what you've heard so far?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Marius's claim and suggesting he might be the Minion, I aim to deflect suspicion away from myself and Dragos. This also sows confusion among the Villagers and makes it harder for them to form a coherent strategy against the Werewolves.
> **Alexia:** Alright, everyone, let's think about this carefully. Marius claims to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, which contradicts Lucian's claim of being a Mason. Considering that there are two Werewolves and potentially a Minion in play, we need to focus on the inconsistencies here. I find it highly suspicious that Marius would accuse Lucian so directly. What if Marius is the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves by throwing suspicion around? We need to be cautious not to fall into a trap.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** By pushing Alexia for more details, we might uncover inconsistencies or gain additional clues that can help us identify the Werewolves. It's important to scrutinize every player's claim to ensure we're not overlooking any potential evidence.
> **Marius:** Alexia, your claim of being a Villager hasn't been thoroughly examined yet. Can you provide any more details or suspicions based on what you've heard so far?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Marius's claim and questioning his timing, I am attempting to redirect suspicion away from myself and Dragos. This also introduces the possibility that Marius is not the Seer, which can confuse the Villagers and make it harder for them to coordinate their efforts.
> **Alexia:** I find it suspicious that Marius is so adamant about accusing Lucian when Lucian's been consistent with his claim. Marius, if you really are the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, why didn't you provide this information sooner? It feels like you might be trying to sow discord among us. I'm starting to think that Marius could be the Minion or even a Werewolf trying to throw us off.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Marius's claim and suggesting he might be the Minion, I can redirect suspicion away from myself and Alexia. This creates confusion and makes it harder for the villagers to come to a consensus, increasing our chances of winning as Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's think about this logically. If Marius is claiming to be the Seer and saw a Mason and Villager in the center, that directly contradicts Lucian's claim of being a Mason. From my perspective, Lucian has been quite consistent with his story. Marius, on the other hand, seems very eager to accuse Lucian. To me, it feels like Marius could be the Minion trying to divert our attention and protect the real Werewolves. We need to be very cautious about who we trust here. I think Marius's actions are highly suspicious and could be a tactic to mislead us. What do the rest of you think?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Marius's claim of being the Seer and seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center contradicts Lucian's consistent claim of being a Mason. This inconsistency, combined with Marius's aggressive accusation, makes it highly suspicious that Marius is either the Minion or a Werewolf trying to mislead us. Voting for Marius increases the chances of protecting myself and Alexia, the known Werewolves.
> **Dragos [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Marius's claim of being the Seer and having seen a Mason and a Villager in the center contradicts Lucian's claim of being a Mason. Marius has been very adamant about accusing Lucian, which seems suspicious. By voting for Marius, I aim to deflect suspicion away from myself and Dragos, and increase the chance of eliminating a Villager or the Minion to help the Werewolf team win.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** I know for a fact that I am the Mason, and Marius's claim to be the Seer and having seen a Mason and a Villager in the center contradicts my role. His eagerness to accuse me and the inconsistencies in his story make him highly suspicious. It's possible that Marius is the Minion or a Werewolf trying to throw us off.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius's claim to be the Seer and having seen a Mason and a Villager in the center contradicts Lucian's consistent claim of being a Mason. Marius's aggressive accusation and attempt to discredit Lucian seem like tactics of a Minion or a Werewolf trying to throw us off. Dragos and Alexia have both provided support for Lucian's consistency, making Marius's actions highly suspicious. Therefore, I vote for Marius to eliminate potential deception and give our team the best chance to win.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** I am the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. This directly contradicts Lucian's claim of being a Mason, which strongly suggests he is either a Werewolf or Minion. His story does not add up, making him the most suspicious player.
> **Marius [Seer]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Mason : 1
* Marius : Seer : 4



>***GAME:*** Marius was killed. The werewolves win.
