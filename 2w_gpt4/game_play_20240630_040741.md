## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Alexandra and Cristina. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Kraven. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Larisa. They are thinking about their action.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gain information about cards that are not in play. This will help narrow down the possible roles for the other players and potentially identify any false claims during the Day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know my role and that the other Mason card is in the center. By asking about the center cards, I can help get some clues about what's left, and maybe catch a Werewolf in a lie.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's get some clarity here. Did anyone check the center cards? We need information about those to make better decisions.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I'm trying to blend in and not draw attention to myself or Cristina. Asking about the roles in the center helps gather information without making me look suspicious.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, let's get things moving. I'll start by saying that I'm just a Villager, but I'm curious if anyone else has seen any roles in the center. We need to figure out what might be in play.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing that I saw Minion and Villager in the center, I can narrow down the potential roles in play and help everyone focus on finding the Werewolves. This also adds credibility to any claims I make later.
> **Larisa:** I saw two center cards, and they were Minion and Villager. This means we can rule out anyone claiming Minion or that specific Villager role. Let's focus on identifying the Werewolves.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** By confirming the roles of the Seer and Masons, we can identify trustworthy players and focus our suspicions on the remaining unknown roles.
> **Michael:** Okay, Larisa says she saw a Minion and a Villager in the center. That leaves a Werewolf, Mason, Seer, and Drunk unaccounted for. Can anyone here claim to be the Seer or Masons? This will help us narrow things down.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** If Larisa is lying about the center cards, we need to figure out her true role. Asking Michael for his role might help us piece this puzzle together and cast some suspicion away from Alexandra and me.
> **Cristina:** Hold on a second, Larisa. You claim to have seen a Minion and a Villager in the center. That’s convenient, but it doesn't necessarily clear you. We haven't heard from Michael yet. Michael, what's your role?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible to identify the Werewolves. By asking Cristina to share any information she has, we can either confirm or refute Larisa's claim and narrow down our suspects.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, based on what Larisa has said, if the Minion and a Villager are in the center, we have fewer roles to worry about. But let's get some clarity here. Cristina, you've been questioning Larisa's claim. Do you have any information that can help us? Maybe confirm a role or share something you saw?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing a question to Michael, I am trying to gather more information and create a bit of chaos. If Michael reveals a role, we can potentially catch him in a lie or use his response to further cast doubt on Larisa. This helps to divert suspicion from myself and Alexandra, while keeping the focus on other players.
> **Cristina:** Michael, I'm still skeptical about Larisa's claim. If she saw the Minion and Villager in the center, that leaves some important roles unaccounted for. Can you confirm what role you had last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Since the Masons can confirm each other, this will help us identify trustworthy players. If they can reveal themselves, we can focus the suspicion on the remaining players who haven't been verified.
> **Michael:** We need to hear from the Masons. If we have both Masons here, they can confirm each other, which will help us narrow down our suspects. So, who's going to step up and claim Mason?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** By questioning the absence of the Seer claim, I can put pressure on the real Seer to come forward, or catch someone in a lie if they falsely claim it. This will help us narrow down our suspicions and focus on finding the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, your claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center is interesting. But I'm concerned that we haven't heard any claims of Seer yet. If no one claims Seer soon, it might mean the Seer card is in the center too, which would be suspicious. Does anyone here want to step up and claim Seer?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Larisa's motives, I can cast some doubt on her credibility without directly accusing her of lying. This also shifts the attention away from me and Cristina while giving us more information to work with.
> **Alexandra:** Larisa, your claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center is interesting. However, I'm not entirely convinced yet. Can you tell us why you chose to look at those specific cards in the center?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael has been asking others to share their information without providing any of his own. This deflection could be a tactic to avoid scrutiny and needs to be addressed.
> **Larisa:** Michael, you've been deflecting a lot, asking for others to step up but not sharing your own role. What was your role last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's claim about the center cards could be a tactic to mislead us, and her story hasn't been strongly backed up by others. We need to start narrowing down suspects and her interactions seem questionable.
> **Michael:** Alright, I'm tired of the deflections and vague claims. Based on Larisa's statement and the fact that no one has stepped up to confirm important roles like the Masons or Seer, I'm starting to think Larisa might be trying to deceive us. I'm accusing Larisa of being a Werewolf. What do you all think?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael has been avoiding sharing his own role while pushing others to reveal theirs. This deflection could be a tactic to avoid scrutiny, and I want to see how he responds to direct questioning.
> **Larisa:** Michael, I find it suspicious that you keep deflecting and asking others for their roles without providing your own. What was your role last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's claim hasn't been backed up by anyone else, and she's been deflecting a lot. We need to start narrowing down suspects, and her interactions seem the most questionable.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. I'm accusing Larisa of being a Werewolf. Her claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center feels like a convenient way to mislead us. What do you all think?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's claim hasn't been backed up by anyone else, and she's been deflecting a lot. We need to start narrowing down suspects, and her interactions seem the most questionable.
> **Michael:** Larisa, I'm finding your claim about the Minion and Villager in the center quite convenient. Why did you choose to look at those specific cards in the center? It seems like you might be trying to mislead us.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra's claim of being a Villager needs more scrutiny since we know one Villager card is in the center. This will help verify her claim or expose potential deception.
> **Larisa:** Alexandra, earlier you claimed to be a Villager. Since we now know one Villager card is in the center, can you explain why you are confident in your role? It seems like a convenient claim.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Larisa's strong insistence on her claim, I aim to cast doubt on her credibility. This can divert suspicion away from myself and Cristina, giving us more time to gather information and potentially identify the Villagers or other important roles to target.
> **Alexandra:** Larisa, I find your claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center quite interesting. If that's true, we still have a Seer, Masons, and a Drunk unaccounted for. You've been pretty confident in your statements, but could this be a way to deflect suspicion away from yourself? Does anyone else find it odd that Larisa is pushing her narrative so strongly? I think we need to consider the possibility that she's trying to mislead us.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Since we know one Villager card is in the center, Alexandra's claim needs to be scrutinized. This will help verify her claim or expose potential deception, which is crucial for finding the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Alexandra, you've claimed to be a Villager, but we know one Villager card is in the center. That's very convenient and makes me suspicious of your claim. Are you really a Villager, or are you hiding something?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Michael's motives and lack of role revelation, I aim to shift the focus onto him and cast doubt on his credibility. This could divert attention away from myself and Cristina, making it harder for others to identify us as Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Michael, you've been quite active in leading the discussion and pushing suspicions on Larisa. Yet, you haven't revealed your own role, which makes me wonder why you're so adamant about accusing her. Are you trying to deflect attention away from yourself?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's claim hasn't been backed up by anyone else, and her interactions seem the most questionable. We need to focus our suspicions on the most likely targets.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone. Based on everything we've heard so far, I'm leaning towards accusing Larisa of being a Werewolf. Her claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center seems too convenient, and she's been deflecting a lot of questions. What do you all think?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael has been deflecting questions and pushing hard to accuse Larisa without revealing his own role. This behavior is suspicious and consistent with someone trying to mislead the group. Given that I know I'm a Mason and that Larisa's claim about the Minion and Villager in the center makes sense, it's likely Michael is a Werewolf trying to deflect attention.
> **Kraven [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa claimed to see a Minion and Villager in the center, which seems like a convenient way to divert attention. Additionally, there have been no clear confirmations of important roles like Masons or Seer, making her claim suspicious. Voting for Larisa helps deflect suspicion away from Cristina and myself, increasing our chances of winning as Werewolves.
> **Alexandra [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's behavior has been highly suspicious. He constantly deflected questions and avoided providing his own role, which is a classic tactic of a Werewolf or Minion. Additionally, his aggressive push to accuse me despite my clear and truthful information further supports the theory that he is trying to mislead us. Voting for Michael gives us the best chance of eliminating a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Larisa [Seer]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center hasn't been backed up by anyone else. Her interactions seem the most questionable, and she's been deflecting a lot. Given the information we have, she seems like the most likely suspect to be a Werewolf.
> **Michael [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa's claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center looks too convenient and hasn't been backed up by anyone else. This accusation has caused a lot of confusion, which could be a tactic to mislead us. Voting for her creates a strong chance to deflect suspicion away from Alexandra and myself, strengthening the werewolf's position.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


The votes were:
* Larisa : Seer : 3
* Michael : Villager : 2



>***GAME:*** Larisa was killed. The werewolves win.
