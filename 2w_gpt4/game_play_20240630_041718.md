## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Andrei and Selene. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Michael is a minion and is aware that both Andrei and Selene are werewolves.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Viktor. They are thinking about their action.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles that remain unassigned. This helps in verifying claims made by other players during the DAY phase, reducing the potential for deception by Werewolves or the Minion.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing this information, we can start narrowing down the possibilities and catch any suspicious behavior or false claims.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, I saw that two of the center cards are Villagers. This means we have fewer Villagers among us than we might think. Let's be careful with our claims.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Viktor's claim could be true, but questioning his decision to look at the center cards can add a bit of doubt and potentially make him seem suspicious. This might deflect attention away from me and Selene while we try to identify and eliminate Villagers.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, you claim to have seen two Villager cards in the center. This means there are fewer Villagers among us, which makes sense given the roles we have. But I'm curious, why did you decide to look at the center cards instead of checking another player's card? It seems like verifying another player's role might give us more concrete information.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Andrei's question directly, I can clarify my reasoning and also subtly put pressure on players who might falsely claim to be Villagers. This can help in identifying Werewolves or the Minion based on their reactions and claims.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, I chose to look at the center cards because they provide a broader overview of the roles that are not in play. Seeing two Villagers in the center helps us narrow down the possibilities and identify false claims more effectively. For example, if someone claims to be a Villager, we know that there are fewer Villager cards available and can scrutinize that claim more closely.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting Dracula on the spot, I can potentially gather more information and redirect suspicion away from myself and Selene. Since Viktor's claim reduces the number of Villagers in play, everyone needs to be scrutinized more carefully, and Dracula's response might give us clues about his role and intentions.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, you have been pretty quiet so far. What role do you claim to have? If Viktor's claim about the center cards is true, there are fewer Villagers than usual, so knowing your role could help us piece things together.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** By asserting my role as the Villager, I can help narrow down the possibilities and force others to reveal their roles or contradict themselves, which can give us valuable information to identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, based on what Viktor said, we know that there are two Villager cards in the center. This means the remaining Villager card is likely one of us, and I claim to be that Villager. If anyone else claims to be a Villager, we should scrutinize that claim closely.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's focus on Viktor's choice might be a way to deflect attention from himself. Getting him to claim a role can help us piece together more information and potentially catch him in a lie.
> **Dracula:** Andrei, your question to Viktor about why he looked at the center instead of another player's card was interesting. But now I'm curious, what role are you claiming?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's claim could be a bluff, and if Michael claims to be a Villager as well, we can create more doubt around their claims. This also helps divert attention away from me and Selene while we gather more information.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, your claim of being the Villager is interesting, but I'm not entirely convinced. If what Viktor says is true about the two Villagers in the center, there's only one Villager card left, which complicates things even more. I'm curious, Michael, you haven't said much. What role do you claim to have?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Since Viktor has claimed to see two Villagers in the center, and Dracula is claiming to be the last Villager, there's a good chance Dracula is lying. It's unlikely for the remaining Villager to surface so easily. We should focus our attention on finding inconsistencies in these claims and identify the real threats to our group.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, based on what we've heard, I think we need to be very careful about who we trust. Viktor claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, which means there are fewer Villagers among us. Dracula claims to be the remaining Villager, but that sounds a bit too convenient. Given the odds, it's more likely that the remaining roles are something other than Villager. Dracula might be trying to blend in too easily.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Dracula, I divert attention away from myself and Andrei. Dracula's claim to be a Villager is an easy target since Viktor has already established that two Villagers are in the center. This makes it more likely for others to agree with my reasoning and shifts the focus onto Dracula.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's break down the information we have so far. Viktor has claimed to have seen two Villagers in the center, and Dracula has conveniently claimed to be the remaining Villager. This is a bit too convenient for my taste, especially since we know there are other roles in play that haven't been mentioned yet. If there are indeed two Villagers in the center, Dracula's claim seems suspicious. We need to consider the possibility that Dracula is trying to blend in by claiming the last Villager spot. Given this, I think we should focus our scrutiny on Dracula and see if his story holds up.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing attention to Dracula's claim and his actions during the night, I'm aiming to cast doubt on him and shift scrutiny away from Andrei and Selene, who are the actual Werewolves. This will help protect my team and increase the chances of the Villagers targeting Dracula instead.
> **Michael:** Dracula, I'm finding your claim to be the last Villager pretty convenient, especially considering Viktor's assertion that two Villager cards are in the center. I'm not convinced by your claim at all. If you're trying to blend in, it seems too obvious. If we go by the logic Viktor presented, there's a good chance you're not a Villager at all. What exactly did you do during the night phase, Dracula?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's strong skepticism about my Villager claim seems like an attempt to divert attention from himself. Getting him to declare his role might either confirm his suspicion or expose his true intent.
> **Dracula:** Michael, you seem quite eager to cast doubt on my claim as the Villager. If you think my claim is suspicious, what role are you claiming to have?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By highlighting the importance of other roles like the Masons and Seer, I'm subtly encouraging them to reveal themselves, which will make it easier to identify and target them later. This also helps shift the focus away from Andrei and Selene, protecting my Werewolf teammates.
> **Michael:** Alright, let's think this through step by step. Viktor claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which leaves only one Villager card among us. Dracula has claimed to be that Villager, which does seem quite convenient given the situation. But let's not forget that there are other roles in play that can give us more information. For example, if there are Masons or a Seer among us, they could confirm or deny these claims. So, I'm curious if anyone else can provide some insight on their roles?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei has been asking questions but hasn't revealed his own role, which is suspicious. Understanding his role will help us piece together the puzzle and evaluate the truthfulness of his statements.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, you seem to be questioning everyone but haven't shared your own role yet. What role are you claiming?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Viktor's claim reduces the number of Villagers among us, and Dracula's convenient claim to be the last Villager raises red flags. Drawing attention to Dracula might help deflect suspicion from myself and Selene, while also helping us identify the true Villagers and special roles.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, based on the information we have, Viktor claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, and Dracula claims to be the remaining Villager. However, this seems a bit too convenient, especially since there are other roles in play. I think Dracula's claim is suspicious, and we should definitely scrutinize it more closely.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Selene, I can potentially gather more information and create doubt around her. This also helps to deflect suspicion away from myself and Selene, while keeping the focus on other players.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, we've heard a lot of interesting claims so far. Viktor claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which would make Dracula's claim to be the remaining Villager quite suspicious. But we need to remember that there are other roles in play that haven't been fully discussed yet. Selene, you've been very quiet and haven't shared much about your role. What role do you claim to have?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Directing suspicion onto Andrei can help deflect attention away from me and potentially onto him. This also aligns with the idea that the more vocal someone is without revealing their role, the more suspicious they appear. By pressing Andrei to reveal his role, it puts him in a position where he might have to scramble for a believable lie, especially if he is a Villager or another role that could be useful to identify and eliminate.
> **Selene:** Alright Andrei, you've been very vocal about wanting to hear from everyone else, but you still haven't shared your own role. If we're to trust anyone's claims, we need to know where you stand. So, what role do you claim to have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Viktor's decision, I aim to create doubt around his claim and possibly make him seem suspicious. This will help deflect attention away from me and Selene, while encouraging others to scrutinize Viktor's motives more closely.
> **Andrei:** Alright Viktor, you've made a significant claim about seeing two Villagers in the center. But considering the complexity of the game, I'm curious about one thing. Is there any reason you chose to look at the center instead of the cards of other players? What were you hoping to achieve with that move?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene's silence is quite suspicious, and we need to know where she stands. If she has any valuable information, it could help us identify the Werewolves or confirm other players' roles.
> **Viktor:** Selene, you've been very quiet so far. What role do you have? If you have any information that could help us, now is the time to share it.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Michael and questioning his role, it deflects suspicion away from me and Andrei. This also aligns with the idea of scrutinizing those who are vocal about others' claims without revealing much about themselves.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and examine the situation. Viktor claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which leaves only one Villager card among us. Dracula has claimed to be that Villager, which is indeed very convenient. However, we haven't heard much from Michael about his role, and Andrei has been quite vocal without revealing his own role. We need more transparency here. Michael, you seem to be very critical of Dracula's claim, but what role do you claim to have? If we are to make an informed decision, we need to know where everyone stands.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Selene has been deflecting questions and pushing for others to reveal their roles. By putting her on the spot, I can create doubt about her intentions and possibly direct attention away from Andrei and Selene, the actual Werewolves. This will help protect my teammates and increase our chances of winning.
> **Michael:** Selene, you've been pushing for transparency and asking others to reveal their roles. But you still haven't shared yours. If you want us to trust you, it's only fair that you come clean about your role. So, what role are you claiming to have?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's claim to be the final Villager seems suspicious given that I saw two Villager cards in the center. Additionally, Michael and Selene have voiced doubt about Dracula's claim, and Andrei's questioning aligns with the same suspicion. Voting for Dracula increases the chances of identifying a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor [Seer]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's claim to be the last Villager seemed too convenient, given Viktor's assertion that two Villager cards are in the center. This makes Dracula's claim suspicious. By voting for Dracula, I want to deflect suspicion away from myself and Selene, while targeting someone whose role is questionable.
> **Andrei [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's strong skepticism about my Villager claim seems like an attempt to divert attention from himself. He hasn't clearly declared his role, and his behavior is suspicious. Voting for him increases the chances of identifying a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's claim to be the lone Villager seems too convenient, especially given Viktor's assertion that two Villager cards are in the center. By voting for Dracula, I can help divert suspicion away from myself and Andrei, increasing our chances of avoiding detection as Werewolves.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Dracula's claim to be the final Villager seems too convenient given Viktor's assertion that two Villager cards are in the center. This makes Dracula's claim highly suspicious. By casting my vote for Dracula, I'm supporting the narrative that he might be lying, which aligns with my goal as the Minion to protect the Werewolves and misdirect the Villagers.
> **Michael [Minion]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Dracula : Villager : 4
* Michael : Minion : 1



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
