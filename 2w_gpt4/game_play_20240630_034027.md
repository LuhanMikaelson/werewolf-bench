## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, my goal is to divert suspicion away from myself and Dragos. By targeting Stefan, I deflect attention and start to create a narrative that could paint him as suspicious. This also helps me gather information about what roles others might claim, enabling me to better disguise my own identity and potentially identify allies like the Minion or threats like the Seer.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's get this started. Last night was intense, and we need to figure out who the Werewolves are. I'm just a Villager, so I'm really counting on the rest of you to help piece this puzzle together. Stefan, you look a bit nervous, what's your role?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By coming out as a Villager first, I can set the tone and get others to reveal their roles. Directing the question to Viktor will help gather information while steering attention away from Larisa and Dragos, the Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Alright, Larisa, I'm not nervous—just eager to get to the bottom of this! I think we should start by hearing from everyone. I'll start: I'm a Villager. I didn't get to do anything last night, but I'm suspicious of those who might have had actions. Viktor, what did you do last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to get more information about what happened during the night. Dragos has not spoken yet, so getting his input could provide valuable insights.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, I think it's crucial we figure out who had night actions and what they did. We can't waste any time with vague claims. Dragos, you seem pretty quiet over there. What was your role last night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking Andrei directly about his role, I can gauge his response and see if he might slip up or reveal something useful. This also diverts attention away from myself and Larisa, giving us more room to maneuver.
> **Dragos:** Alright, everyone, let's calm down a bit and think this through logically. I know it's important to figure out who's who, but let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. I'm a Villager, and I think we should focus on hearing more from those who claim to have had night actions. It might help us piece together the puzzle. Andrei, you haven't spoken yet. What was your role last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Viktor is actually the other Mason, he should back up my claim. This will help us identify true Villagers and potentially expose the Werewolves through process of elimination.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, I've been listening carefully, and I think we need to clarify some things right now. Larisa and Stefan both claim to be Villagers, but we haven't heard from Viktor yet. Viktor, you were asked by Stefan what you did last night, but you didn't give an answer. What was your role last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei is my fellow Mason. By questioning him directly, I can cross-check his response and see if we can build a credible narrative together to help identify the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone, it's clear we need to get to the bottom of this quickly. Dragos, you say you're a Villager, but that's an easy claim to make. We need more concrete information. Andrei, what did you do last night? And remember, be specific.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor is the other Mason, and this question will force him to either confirm our Mason roles, which will help us identify true Villagers and potentially expose the Werewolves, or he'll have to lie, which would be very suspicious.
> **Andrei:** Alright, everyone. I think it's time to lay some cards on the table. Viktor, last night you didn't answer Stefan's question about your role. Everyone else has at least claimed to be a Villager. So Viktor, what did you do last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos's claim of being a Villager is convenient and doesn't provide any real information. Pressuring him might reveal more about his role or his intentions.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone! Let's get some clarity here. Dragos, you've claimed to be a Villager, but that's a pretty safe claim with no real risk. We need to find out who had night actions. I think it's time for you to come clean about what you really know.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting Stefan on the spot, I can see how he handles pressure, and it diverts attention away from myself and Larisa. Plus, if Stefan stumbles, it could make him look more suspicious, shifting the focus towards him.
> **Dragos:** Alright, let's cut to the chase. Stefan has been awfully silent after making his initial claim of being a Villager. I think we should be focusing more on him. Stefan, can you elaborate on why you think Viktor is suspicious?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** Viktor has been deflecting questions and not providing clear answers about his night actions. This kind of behavior is typical of someone trying to hide something. By accusing Viktor, I can help divert attention away from Larisa and Dragos, who are the actual Werewolves, and hopefully get the others to focus on him instead.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, I think Viktor's evasiveness is suspicious. He hasn't given us any concrete information about his role, and that's a red flag. I'm starting to think Viktor could be one of the Werewolves.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting Stefan on the defensive, I can see how he handles pressure and possibly shift suspicion away from myself and Larisa. If Stefan stumbles, it could make him look more suspicious, helping our strategy.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, Stefan has been pointing fingers at Viktor without providing much evidence. This is starting to feel like a classic deflection tactic. Stefan, you're claiming to be a Villager, but so far, all you've done is sow confusion. Can you give us any real reason why we should trust you?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting pressure on Andrei for more concrete information, we can deflect attention away from Larisa and Dragos. This also helps steer the conversation towards uncovering the roles of other players, which can be beneficial in identifying potential threats to the Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, let's not get lost in the back-and-forth. We've heard a lot of claims about being Villagers, but we need concrete information about night actions. Andrei, you haven't given us any specific details yet. What did you do last night? It's time to be clear and transparent.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor is the other Mason, but he has been evasive, which is making everyone suspicious. By pushing him to reveal his role, we can confirm our Mason roles and help narrow down who the Werewolves might be. If he confirms he's a Mason, it will help us identify the true Villagers and expose the Werewolves through process of elimination.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, I think it's time to be open about our night actions. Viktor, I'm calling you out. I know you're not just a Villager. It's time to reveal your true role.


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei is my fellow Mason, so I know he is trustworthy. By calling him out directly, it will give him a chance to confirm our shared role and provide concrete information that can help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, it's time to get serious. Let's review what we know so far: Larisa and Stefan both claim to be Villagers, which is a safe claim. Dragos also claims to be a Villager, but hasn't provided any concrete actions from last night. Andrei, you've been avoiding giving any details about your night actions. It's time to come clean.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Revealing my role as Mason and confirming Viktor as the other Mason will help us narrow down the suspects. Since Larisa, Stefan, and Dragos are not Masons, one or more of them must be lying about being Villagers. This helps us identify potential Werewolves through process of elimination.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, I'm going to lay it out there. I am one of the Masons, and Viktor is the other Mason. This is why I've been pushing Viktor to reveal his role. Now that I've revealed this, we know for sure that Larisa, Stefan, and Dragos are not Masons. Let's focus on finding the Werewolves among them.


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting pressure on Larisa, I can steer suspicion away from Dragos and keep the attention on the non-Werewolves. Since Andrei and Viktor have claimed to be Masons, it’s essential to cast doubt on their claims subtly by questioning Larisa, thereby creating confusion among the Villagers and Masons.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, pay attention! Andrei has just claimed to be a Mason, and he says Viktor is the other Mason. If this is true, then we need to look closely at the remaining roles. Larisa and Dragos have both claimed to be Villagers, but that feels too convenient. If Andrei and Viktor are telling the truth, we should be focusing on Larisa and Dragos. Larisa, can you provide any more details that might help us clear this up?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Dragos, I'm trying to shift the focus away from myself and create doubt about his claim of being a Villager. This also buys time to gather more information and potentially identify the Seer or other roles.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's take a closer look at Andrei's claim. He says he's a Mason and that Viktor is the other Mason. If this is true, then we need to scrutinize the remaining players more closely. Dragos, you've been quiet and your only claim is that you're a Villager, which is very convenient. Can you provide us with any specific details or reasoning that supports your claim?


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Andrei's claim and redirecting the focus to Larisa, I can divert attention away from myself and Larisa, the other Werewolf. This also puts Larisa in a position to steer the conversation in a way that benefits us.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think this through carefully. Andrei's sudden claim of being a Mason and calling Viktor the other Mason seems a bit too convenient. If they were really Masons, they should have been more upfront about it earlier. This late reveal raises some red flags for me. Larisa, who do you believe might be the Werewolves among us?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning the validity of Andrei and Viktor's Mason claims and pointing out the ease of claiming to be Villagers, I'm casting doubt on their roles without directly accusing them. This approach keeps the suspicion spread out and away from me, while also buying time to gather more information that could help identify who the Seer or other key roles might be.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture here. Andrei and Viktor claim to be Masons, which is a powerful claim and, if true, really narrows down our suspects. But we need to remember that claiming to be a Mason is also a very safe move for a Werewolf or even the Minion, knowing that the real Masons might be in the center and can't contradict them. Stefan and Dragos, you've both claimed to be Villagers, which is also an easy claim to make. We need more concrete information.


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** By directing the accusation towards Larisa, we can pressure her to provide more information and check the validity of her claims. This will help us narrow down the suspects and identify any inconsistencies in her story.
> **Viktor:** Everyone, let's break this down logically. Andrei and I are the Masons, and we can vouch for each other. That means we are not Werewolves. Larisa, Stefan, and Dragos have all claimed to be Villagers, but it’s highly likely at least one of them is lying. Larisa, you were one of the first to claim Villager and have been directing the conversation. Why should we believe that you're not a Werewolf?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Stefan has been vocal and accused multiple players without providing concrete evidence. Given that Andrei and Viktor claim to be Masons, which leaves Stefan's behavior as highly suspicious. Voting for him could divert attention from Dragos and me, increasing our chances of winning as Werewolves.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Dragos (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Stefan has been pointing fingers at Viktor without providing substantial evidence and has been sowing confusion. Voting for Stefan might help Larisa and me, as Werewolves, divert suspicion from ourselves.
> **Dragos [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** Viktor has been deflecting questions and not providing clear answers about his night actions. This kind of behavior is typical of someone trying to hide something. By voting for Viktor, I aim to divert attention away from Larisa and Dragos, the Werewolves, and help secure a win for my team.
> **Stefan [Minion]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei and I are confirmed Masons, which means neither of us are Werewolves. Both Stefan and Dragos have claimed to be Villagers, but so has Larisa. Larisa has been directing the conversation, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from herself. Therefore, I believe Larisa is the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf.
> **Viktor [Mason]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa was the first to claim being a Villager and has been directing the conversation, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion. Given that Viktor and I are Masons and can vouch for each other, it's likely that one of the remaining players is lying. Larisa's early and active role in the discussion makes her a prime suspect.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Larisa.


The votes were:
* Larisa : Werewolf : 2
* Stefan : Minion : 2
* Viktor : Mason : 1



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Larisa, Stefan. The villagers win.
