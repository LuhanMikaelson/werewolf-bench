## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Alexandra and Emil. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Vladimir. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Ileana. They are thinking about their action.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards can provide crucial information about what roles might be left undistributed among the players. This can help narrow down the possibilities during the Day phase and assist in deducing who the Werewolves or other key roles might be.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I don't have any special information myself. By asking this, I'm hoping to prompt the Seer or Masons to come forward discreetly, without revealing their exact roles, to help narrow down our suspects.
> **Michael:** Who among us has any special knowledge that might help us identify the Werewolves?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking about night actions, I aim to gather information that can be used to identify the villagers and special roles. This will help me cast suspicion on them later while keeping the focus off myself and Emil.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, let's get things moving. I think it's crucial to hear from everyone if they have any special roles. This will help us narrow down our suspects. So, who among us woke up in the night and performed an action?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** By urging players to share concrete information, especially from roles like the Seer, we can quickly narrow down our suspects and confirm or refute any claims made so far.
> **Vladimir:** I think it's important to establish if anyone has seen something definitive, like a Seer looking at a role. We need solid information to catch the Werewolves.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing this information, I can help narrow down the potential roles and eliminate the possibility of a Minion messing with our deductions. This will help us focus on finding the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Okay everyone, let's get to the bottom of this. I am the Seer, and I looked at two of the center cards last night. The Minion and one of the Villagers are there, which means we don’t have a Minion among us.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to cast some doubt on Ileana's claim by questioning her choice, making it seem like she might be trying to mislead us. This also aligns with my goal of diverting suspicion from myself and Alexandra.
> **Emil:** Ileana, since you claim to be the Seer and saw the Minion and Villager in the center, it means we have no Minion among us. However, it's possible that the remaining center card might be a Werewolf or another Villager. Ileana, why did you choose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By directing this question to Emil, I can clarify my strategy and ensure the group understands the rationale behind my actions. This transparency will help build trust and facilitate better deduction among the villagers.
> **Ileana:** Emil, I chose to look at the center cards because it gives us a broader understanding of what's potentially out there. If we know two of the center cards, we can narrow down the roles in play among us. This helps us focus on identifying the Werewolves more efficiently.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Casting doubt on Ileana's claim can divert suspicion away from myself and Alexandra. By questioning her choice, I aim to create uncertainty and confusion, making it harder for others to pinpoint the Werewolves. Additionally, it aligns with my goal of misdirecting the Villagers without making a direct accusation.
> **Emil:** Ileana, your explanation makes sense, but it also strikes me as a bit convenient. Claiming to be the Seer and saying you saw the Minion and Villager in the center allows you to avoid scrutinizing any specific player. This could be a strategic move to stay under the radar. I'm not saying you're definitely a Werewolf, but we should consider this possibility. Also, since we have no Minion among us according to you, we should be looking closely at the remaining roles.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir's earlier statement about the Seer suggests he might have some insight or is fishing for information. By directly questioning him, I can gauge his reactions and whether he's hiding something like being a Werewolf or another role.
> **Ileana:** Vladimir, you mentioned earlier that it would be helpful to hear from a Seer if they have seen any roles. I'm curious, did you wake up last night and perform any actions? If so, what did you see?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana's claim as the Seer is convenient and avoids immediate suspicion. By questioning her decision, I aim to gather more information and potentially highlight inconsistencies in her story.
> **Vladimir:** Ileana, I find it odd that you chose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card. That could be a tactic to avoid getting caught in a lie. If you are indeed the Seer, can you explain why you thought this was a better choice?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By questioning Vladimir directly, I can gather more information about his role and see if his story has any inconsistencies. This will help us determine if he is hiding something, like being a Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** Vladimir, you're right that looking at the center cards instead of another player's card could be seen as a way to avoid direct confrontation. But given that I found the Minion and a Villager in the center, we can safely assume no one here is the Minion. This narrows down the roles significantly, especially since we're looking for Werewolves. So, Vladimir, did you wake up last night? If so, what did you see?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to validate Ileana's claim and gather more information from other players to deduce who might be the Werewolves. Michael's response could provide more context or contradictions to help us decide.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone. Let's think this through. If Ileana is telling the truth about seeing the Minion and a Villager in the center, then that helps us narrow down the roles significantly. But, Emil's point about Ileana's claim being convenient holds weight. If we can't trust her entirely, we need to gather more information from others. So, Michael, did you wake up last night and perform any actions? If so, what did you see?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to test Ileana's claim as the Seer. By questioning her choice to look at the center cards, I can gauge her reaction and see if she's hiding something. If she's telling the truth, she should have a solid reason. If not, it might expose her as a Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Ileana, your claim as the Seer seems a bit too convenient. Why did you choose to look at the center cards rather than another player's card? It feels like you're trying to avoid directly accusing anyone.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** We need more information from everyone to make an informed decision. Michael hasn't provided any input so far, and his hesitation might indicate something important. Let's see what he has to say.
> **Ileana:** Alright, everyone, let's focus on identifying the Werewolves. Michael, you haven't shared anything yet. Did you wake up last night and perform any actions?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's scrutiny of Ileana could be an attempt to divert suspicion, or he might genuinely be trying to uncover the truth. By asking him about his role and actions, we can gauge his alignment and potentially catch inconsistencies.
> **Michael:** Emil, you've been quite vocal about questioning Ileana's claim. What role did you wake up with last night? Did you perform any actions?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Michael directly, I can gather more information and potentially cast doubt on his role without directing too much attention towards myself or Alexandra. It also helps divert suspicion away from us by keeping the focus on others.
> **Emil:** Michael, I didn't wake up last night, so I don't have any special knowledge. But I find it interesting that Ileana is so adamant about her claim being the Seer and seeing the Minion and Villager in the center. It feels like a convenient way to avoid direct accusations. We need to be careful and consider all possibilities. So, Michael, what role did you wake up with last night? Did you perform any actions?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** By addressing Emil's behavior directly, I hope to prompt a response that might reveal inconsistencies or defensive behavior, indicating that he could be a Werewolf. My goal is to gather more information that helps narrow down our suspects.
> **Michael:** Emil, I find your consistent questioning of Ileana interesting, but you've also mentioned that you didn't wake up last night. This makes me wonder about your motivations. Why are you so focused on discrediting Ileana's claim? Are you trying to deflect attention away from yourself?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the focus towards Michael, I can divert suspicion away from myself and Alexandra. This also forces him to reveal more information, which can help in my strategy of creating confusion and doubt among the Villagers.
> **Emil:** Alright, Michael, you've been pretty quiet and haven't shared any information about your role or what you did last night. I find it odd that you're questioning my motives without providing any details of your own. So, Michael, did you wake up last night and perform any actions? If so, what role did you have and what did you see?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been very focused on discrediting Ileana without offering substantial information about his own role. This behavior aligns with that of a Werewolf trying to create confusion and avoid detection. By accusing Emil, we can gauge his reaction and potentially unmask him as a Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, I think it's time to make an accusation. Given the information we've gathered, I find Emil's behavior to be quite suspicious. He's been very vocal about questioning Ileana's claim, yet hasn't provided any concrete information himself. It feels like he's trying to divert attention away from himself. I'm inclined to believe Ileana's claim as the Seer, which means Emil might be a Werewolf trying to sow doubt.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By shifting the focus towards Vladimir and Alexandra, I can create a broader pool of suspicion and gather more information. This also helps divert attention away from myself and Alexandra, making it harder for the Villagers to pinpoint the Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, I think it's important to consider all possibilities here. While Ileana's claim as the Seer seems plausible, we also have to remember that anyone can claim to be the Seer to throw us off. Given that we still don't have concrete evidence against anyone, we need to hear more from Vladimir and Alexandra. They've been rather quiet, and we need to ensure we're not missing any crucial information.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's silence is suspicious. We need more information from him to better understand his role and potentially identify the Werewolves.
> **Michael:** Vladimir, you've been pretty quiet so far. Did you wake up last night and perform any actions?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been very vocal in questioning Ileana without providing much information about his own role. This behavior can be indicative of a Werewolf trying to create confusion and avoid detection. Ileana's claim as the Seer seems plausible, especially since no one else has disputed it. Vladimir and Alexandra have been quieter, so Emil stands out as the most suspicious candidate based on his interactions and lack of concrete information.
> **Michael [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana's claim as the Seer appears too convenient and hasn't been corroborated by any other players. This makes me suspect she could be trying to mislead us.
> **Alexandra [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil has been consistently questioning Ileana's claim as the Seer without providing any concrete information about his own role. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate that he is trying to deflect attention away from himself, potentially as a Werewolf. Ileana's claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center narrows down the possibilities, making Emil's actions more suspicious.
> **Vladimir [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil has been consistently questioning my claim as the Seer without providing any concrete information himself. This behavior seems like a deliberate attempt to sow doubt and divert attention away from himself. Given that I saw the Minion and Villager in the center, eliminating the possibility of a Minion among us, I believe Emil's behavior is more indicative of a Werewolf trying to create confusion. Therefore, I will vote for Emil.
> **Ileana [Seer]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana's claim as the Seer seems too convenient and could be a strategic move to avoid scrutiny. By casting doubt on her claim, I aim to divert attention away from myself and Alexandra, making it harder for the villagers to pinpoint the Werewolves. Additionally, her choice to look at the center cards instead of other player roles raises suspicion.
> **Emil [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


The votes were:
* Ileana : Seer : 2
* Emil : Werewolf : 3
