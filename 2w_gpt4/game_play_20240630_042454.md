## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Selene and Vladimir. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Cristina is a minion and is aware that both Selene and Vladimir are werewolves.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Marius. They are thinking about their action.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about which roles are definitely not in play. This can help narrow down the possibilities for who might be a Werewolf or a Minion among the other players, making it easier to identify suspicious behavior during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By encouraging everyone to share their roles or actions, I can start gathering information and see if anyone's statements contradict each other. This will help me identify potential threats or allies without revealing my identity as a Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's get to the bottom of this. I think it would be helpful if we all start by stating our roles or at least giving some information about what we did during the night phase.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I'm positioning myself as a non-threatening player with no special abilities. Encouraging everyone to share will help gather information that I can use to identify the Seer, Masons, and possibly the Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, let's get some information on the table. Last night, I was a Villager and I didn't have any special actions to perform. I think it's important we hear from everyone about their roles and any actions they took.


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming to be the Seer, I can provide credible information that might mislead the Villagers. Also, revealing the Drunk card helps create confusion, as players will wonder if they've swapped roles unknowingly.
> **Cristina:** Okay, everyone seems to be sharing their roles, so I'll join in too. I was the Seer last night. I decided to look at two of the center cards and saw that one was a Villager and the other was the Drunk. This means there's a good chance some of us might still be Villagers, but there's definitely no Drunk in play.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's claim directly contradicts what I saw as the Seer. By calling out this discrepancy, I can help the village team focus on identifying the real threats.
> **Marius:** Cristina, that's interesting because I also looked at two center cards last night, and I saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. There's no way Drunk was in the center, so I think you're lying.


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** Marius claimed to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, which contradicts my claim. By challenging his statement, I can cast doubt on him and potentially divert suspicion away from the werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Marius, there's no way both of us could have seen two center cards. Are you sure you're not trying to cover something up? Maybe you're the one lying?


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's claim directly contradicts my information as the Seer, which means she's likely not telling the truth. By challenging her directly, we can gather more reactions and possibly identify the real threats among us.
> **Marius:** Alright, Cristina, your claim doesn't add up because I saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, not a Drunk. If you're lying about being the Seer, you could be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf. We need to figure this out.


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** By asking Selene to reveal her role, I can gauge her reaction and potentially build a narrative that supports her and Vladimir. This will also divert attention away from me and create confusion among the Villagers.
> **Cristina:** Selene, you've been pretty quiet so far. Can you tell us your role and what you did during the night?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pointing out the inconsistency between Cristina and Marius's claims, I can cast suspicion on them and divert attention away from myself and Vladimir. This will help create confusion and make it harder for the Villagers to identify the real Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Alright, Cristina and Marius, it seems like you're both claiming to be the Seer, but your stories don't add up. Cristina, you said you saw a Villager and the Drunk in the center, while Marius claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager. This inconsistency makes me suspicious of both of you. There's a good chance that one of you is lying to cover up being a Werewolf or a Minion. We need to focus on these conflicting claims and figure out who is trying to deceive us.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been quiet and hasn't revealed her role yet. We need to gather more information to see if there's any inconsistency with her role or actions. This might help us clarify the conflicting claims between Cristina and Marius and identify who is lying.
> **Alexia:** Selene, you mentioned that you're trying to figure out the conflicting claims between Cristina and Marius. Can you tell us what your role was and if you did anything during the night?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By getting Alexia to reveal her role, I can gather more information and potentially find inconsistencies in her story, which might help divert suspicion away from me and Vladimir. It also shows that I'm actively participating in the discussion and trying to figure out the truth, which can help build trust with the other players.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, let's calm down and take a step back for a moment. We have two conflicting claims here: Cristina says she's the Seer and saw a Villager and the Drunk in the center, while Marius claims he's the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager. This inconsistency could mean that one of them is lying, potentially a Werewolf or a Minion. Given this setup, Alexia, you haven't said much yet. Could you please tell us what your role was and what actions you took during the night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** There are conflicting claims between Cristina and Marius about what they saw in the center. If Cristina is lying, she could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive us. Calling her out might help us determine the truth.
> **Alexia:** Cristina, I'm having a hard time believing your story. Marius also claimed to be the Seer and saw different cards in the center. If you both were the Seer, you wouldn't have seen completely different things. To me, it sounds like one of you is lying, and right now, Cristina, your story seems more suspicious.


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** By getting Alexia to reveal her role, I can gather more information and potentially spot inconsistencies. Since Selene and Vladimir are Werewolves and need to be protected, it's crucial to focus suspicion on other players. Alexia seems like a good candidate to press for information, as she has been pointing out inconsistencies but hasn't revealed her own role yet.
> **Cristina:** Alexia, you've been observing and commenting on the situation, but you haven't shared your role yet. Can you tell us what you were during the night and if you performed any actions?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has been avoiding giving specific information about her role. If she's a Villager or a Mason, it would be helpful to know. Her silence is making her seem suspicious, and we need to gather more information from her to clarify the conflicting claims between Cristina and Marius.
> **Alexia:** Selene, you've been quiet about your role. Can you clarify what your role was and what actions you took during the night?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By highlighting the conflicting claims from Cristina and Marius, I can cast suspicion on both of them. This will help divert attention away from myself and Vladimir, making it harder for the Villagers to identify the real Werewolves. Additionally, this shows that I'm actively participating in the discussion and trying to figure out the truth, which can help build trust with the other players.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, let's address the elephant in the room. Based on what we've heard so far, we have conflicting claims from Cristina and Marius about being the Seer and what they saw in the center. Cristina claims she saw a Villager and the Drunk, while Marius claims he saw a Mason and a Villager. Given that there's a clear contradiction here, I think it's important we focus on this inconsistency. One of them has to be lying.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By getting Alexia to reveal her role and actions, I can gather more information and potentially find inconsistencies in her story, which might help divert suspicion away from me and Vladimir. It also shows that I'm actively participating in the discussion and trying to figure out the truth, which can help build trust with the other players.
> **Selene:** Alexia, you've been pointing fingers at everyone but haven't told us your role yet. What role were you, and did you do anything during the night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's silence about her role is suspicious. It's important to gather more information from her to clarify the conflicting claims between Cristina and Marius. If she's hiding something, it might help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Alexia:** Selene, you've been very quiet about your role, and you've been trying to steer the conversation without giving us any concrete information. This makes me suspicious of you. Are you hiding something?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By highlighting the conflicting claims from Cristina and Marius, I can cast suspicion on both of them. This will help divert attention away from myself and Vladimir, making it harder for the Villagers to identify the real Werewolves. Additionally, this shows that I'm actively participating in the discussion and trying to figure out the truth, which can help build trust with the other players.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, it's time to address the elephant in the room. Based on the conflicting claims from Cristina and Marius about being the Seer, it's clear that one of them is lying. Cristina said she saw a Villager and the Drunk in the center, while Marius said he saw a Mason and a Villager. Given that there's a clear contradiction here, I think it's important we focus on this inconsistency. One of them has to be lying.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking the Masons to come forward, we can potentially discredit Marius without directly attacking him. If the Masons confirm they saw each other, it would cast doubt on Marius's claim and shift suspicion away from me and Selene. This keeps the focus on the conflicting claims and helps us identify who might be trying to deceive the group.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, this back-and-forth between Cristina and Marius is really heating up. Marius, if you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, it would be helpful for the Masons to come forward and confirm they didn't see each other. This could help us clear things up a bit. Masons, can you confirm or deny this?


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Marius, I can shift the focus away from Selene and Vladimir, who I know are Werewolves. This will create confusion and doubt among the Villagers, making it harder for them to pinpoint the real Werewolves. Plus, Marius being accused might cause other players to reveal more information that could be useful for the Werewolf team.
> **Cristina:** Alright, everyone, I've been thinking this through and I'm starting to see where the confusion might be coming from. Marius, your claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center doesn't sit well with me. If there are two Masons in play and they didn't see each other, that adds more complexity. Given the conflicting statements about the Seer role and the cards in the center, I believe we need to focus on who has been consistent and who has not. For now, I'm going to accuse Marius of being a Werewolf. This whole situation with conflicting Seer claims makes me think he's trying to cover something up.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to get more players involved in the discussion and gather as much information as possible to identify who might be lying. Vladimir's input as a claimed Villager could help us make a more informed decision.
> **Marius:** Vladimir, it's crucial that we get more clarity here. You mentioned you're a Villager, but given the contradictory claims between Cristina and myself about the Seer role, can you share your thoughts on who you find more suspicious or if you've noticed any behavior that stands out?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** There are conflicting claims between Cristina and Marius about being the Seer and what they saw in the center. Cristina's story about seeing a Villager and the Drunk in the center doesn't hold up against Marius's claim of seeing a Mason and a Villager. Additionally, Cristina's aggressive defense and accusation towards Marius seem more suspicious. By voting for Cristina, I aim to create more doubt and potential confusion among the Villagers, which can help Vladimir and me as Werewolves.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Cristina's claim of seeing a Villager and the Drunk in the center is inconsistent with Marius's claim of seeing a Mason and a Villager. Since there can only be one Seer and the claims are conflicting, one of them must be lying. Voting for Cristina, who appears more suspicious, helps protect the werewolf team and maintains my cover.
> **Vladimir [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Cristina (thoughts as Minion):*** Given the conflicting claims between Cristina and Marius about being the Seer, and considering Cristina's strategy to protect the Werewolves, it's best to divert suspicion towards Marius. This creates confusion among the Villagers and increases the chances that they will not correctly identify the Werewolves.
> **Cristina [Minion]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's claim of being the Seer and seeing a Villager and the Drunk in the center directly contradicts what I saw as the Seer. I saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, which makes me believe Cristina is lying. Given the conflicting statements, I believe Cristina is more likely to be a Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive us.
> **Marius [Seer]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's claim of being the Seer and seeing a Villager and the Drunk in the center was contradicted by Marius, who claimed to be the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Marius's story seems more consistent, and Cristina's story doesn't add up. This makes me believe Cristina is likely a Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive us.
> **Alexia [Villager]:** I am voting for Cristina.


The votes were:
* Cristina : Minion : 4
* Marius : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Cristina was killed. The werewolves win.
