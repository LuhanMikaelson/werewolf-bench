## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Knowing who the Masons are can confirm some people as villagers, and it will give us a base to start discussing who might be the Werewolves.
> **Michael:** I think we should start by asking if anyone is a Mason. It will help us narrow down our suspicions.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Since Masons reveal themselves to each other at night, confirming their identities can help the village team deduce who is telling the truth and who might be lying. This should help cast suspicion away from me and Ileana while we figure out who the Minion might be.
> **Andrei:** I think it's a good idea to figure out if we have any Masons among us. If we can confirm them, it will give us a better starting point to narrow down our suspicions about who the Werewolves might be.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's initial suggestion to find the Masons could be a strategic move to gain trust. By asking him directly, we can see how consistent his story is and maybe catch him off guard if he's lying.
> **Lucian:** Michael, you suggested we start by asking if anyone is a Mason. Why don't you tell us if you're one?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Knowing who the Masons are can confirm some people as villagers, and it will give us a base to start discussing who might be the Werewolves.
> **Michael:** Alright, let's get things moving. I'm not a Mason, but if there are any Masons among us, it would be really helpful if you could reveal yourselves now.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By opening up the floor for more information, I'm hoping to gather more details that might help me identify who the Seer or Villagers could be. This can also help me and Andrei blend in better with the group and avoid suspicion.
> **Ileana:** Alright, let's keep this moving. I'll go ahead and say that I'm not a Mason either. But it's interesting that no one has stepped up yet. Maybe we should also ask if anyone has any information from the night phase? Like, did anyone see any suspicious activity or maybe have a special role that could help us out here?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing myself as the Mason, I can help build trust among the group and focus our attention on identifying the Werewolves. Since I know the other Mason card is in the center, this is valuable information to share. I'm also prompting others with special roles to come forward with any information they may have gathered during the night phase.
> **Selene:** Alright, since no one has stepped up as a Mason yet, I'll come forward. I'm a Mason, and I didn't see any other Masons last night which means the other Mason card is in the center. This should help us narrow things down. Now, I'm curious if anyone has information from the Seer or any other role that could have seen some activity during the night?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei was supportive of finding the Masons earlier, so let's see if he has more information or if he's trying to divert our attention.
> **Michael:** Alright, we now have one Mason confirmed. Selene, it's good to know you're on the village team. Now, let's focus on narrowing down the potential Werewolves. Andrei, you seemed eager to find the Masons earlier. Do you have any information or special role that could help us identify who the Werewolves might be?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Michael initiated the conversation about Masons but hasn't given any solid information about his own role. By questioning him, I can redirect the suspicion towards him and away from me and Ileana.
> **Andrei:** I think it's suspicious that Michael started by suggesting we ask about the Masons but didn't provide any new information himself. Michael, what's your role? I feel like you might be hiding something.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's eagerness to question me seems suspicious, especially since he hasn't provided any useful information himself. If he has a role that could help us, now is the time to reveal it. Otherwise, he might be trying to divert attention away from himself.
> **Michael:** Andrei, you seem pretty quick to question me when I'm just trying to get us to find the Masons. What's your role? Are you trying to divert attention away from yourself?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Michael's reluctance to reveal his role, I can cast suspicion on him and divert attention away from myself and Ileana. This could help us identify who the Seer or other Villagers might be, so we can target them for the vote.
> **Andrei:** Michael, the way you're deflecting the question makes me even more suspicious. If you have nothing to hide, you should just tell us your role. Otherwise, it feels like you're trying to divert attention away from yourself.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to press Andrei for more information since he's been deflecting questions and making accusations without providing any concrete details. This behavior is suspicious and needs to be investigated further.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, we need to stay focused. Andrei, you seem really intent on deflecting questions back to me without providing any actual information. If you're truly on the village team, you should be helping us gather more useful information. So far, all you've done is cast suspicion without any basis. Do you have any actual information or a special role?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Selene's timing and reasoning for revealing her role, I can cast some doubt on her claim without directly accusing her. This could divert attention away from me and Ileana while we look for other potential targets.
> **Andrei:** Selene, you claim to be the Mason who didn't see another Mason. Can you tell us more about why you decided to reveal your role now? It seems like a risky move if you're really on the village team.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian has been rather quiet and hasn't provided any information about his role. It's important to push for more information to narrow down potential Werewolves. By directly addressing him, I can encourage him to reveal his role or at least provide some useful information for the group.
> **Selene:** Lucian, you haven't shared anything about your role yet. Are you hiding something? It's suspicious that you haven't contributed any useful information so far.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's deflections and lack of concrete information make him highly suspicious. By pressing him to reveal his role, we can potentially catch him in a lie or force him to reveal useful information.
> **Lucian:** Michael, you still haven't answered what your role is. You've been very eager to direct the conversation but haven't provided any solid information yourself. Are you hiding something?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's silence is suspicious, and he's been deflecting questions. It's important to get him to reveal more information to help identify who the Werewolves might be.
> **Michael:** Lucian, you've been pretty quiet and haven't contributed much to our discussion. Are you hiding something? What's your role?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's evasiveness and the way he's deflecting questions is highly suspicious. By pressing him to reveal his role, we can either catch him in a lie or force him to provide useful information that will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Michael, you've been avoiding answering questions directly and instead deflecting them back at others. What's your role?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's silence and deflection are suspicious. We need more information from him to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Michael:** Lucian, you still haven't shared anything about your role. You've been quiet and deflecting questions. What role do you have?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's behavior has been highly suspicious. He's been directing the conversation without giving any concrete answers about his own role. By pressing him to reveal his role, we can either catch him in a lie or force him to provide useful information that will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Michael, your evasiveness is really concerning. You've been deflecting questions and haven't provided any solid information. It's time to come clean. What's your role?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been evasive and accusatory without providing any solid information. His behavior is suspicious, and we need to press him to reveal more about his role.
> **Michael:** Andrei, you still haven't given us any useful information and keep deflecting questions. This makes me really suspicious of you. Are you hiding something? What's your role?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By shifting the focus to Lucian, who has been quiet and not contributed much, I can divert attention away from myself and Ileana. It also puts pressure on Lucian to reveal his role or provide information, making it harder for him to strategize if he is a Villager.
> **Andrei:** Lucian, you’ve been deflecting questions and haven’t provided any useful information. You seem very quiet, which is quite suspicious. Are you a Werewolf?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been evasive and accusatory without providing any solid information. His behavior is suspicious, and it seems like he's trying to divert attention away from himself, which makes me think he might be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Michael [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Michael has been deflecting questions and has not provided any useful information about his role. This evasiveness makes him the most suspicious player and likely to be on the village team, which as a Werewolf, I want to eliminate.
> **Andrei [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael has been highly evasive and deflective throughout the discussion. He initiated the conversation about finding the Masons but provided no concrete information himself, which raises suspicion. His behavior indicates he might be hiding something, possibly being a Werewolf or a Minion.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Michael has been very evasive and has deflected questions back to others without providing any solid information about his role. This behavior is highly suspicious and suggests he might be trying to hide something. By voting for Michael, I aim to cast suspicion on a player who has not been cooperative, thereby helping to steer attention away from myself and Andrei, my fellow Werewolf.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael has been deflecting questions and not providing any useful information about his role. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate that he is a Werewolf trying to avoid detection. Voting for Michael is the best way to narrow down potential Werewolves and win the game for the village team.
> **Selene [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


The votes were:
* Michael : Villager : 4
* Andrei : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The werewolves win.
