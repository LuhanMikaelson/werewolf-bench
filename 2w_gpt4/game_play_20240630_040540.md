## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Kraven and Ileana. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dracula. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Stefan. They are thinking about their action.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards gives me more information about the cards that are not in play, which helps narrow down the possibilities of what roles the other players could have. This will aid the village team in identifying the Werewolves more effectively during the day phase.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By encouraging open discussions, I'm trying to blend in as a cooperative Villager. This can also help me gather more information to figure out who might be the Seer or Masons, so I can later cast suspicion on them.
> **Kraven:** I think it's important that we hear from everyone about any potential roles they might have seen or actions they took during the night. Let's get as much information on the table as possible before we start pointing fingers.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing the information I have as the Seer helps the village team by confirming that two of the center cards are not in play. This narrows down the roles that the other players could have, making it easier to identify the Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** I think we've got some good information already on the table. I checked two cards in the center, and I know for sure that the Minion and a Villager are not in play. Let's use this information to narrow down our suspects.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan’s claim is crucial in narrowing down potential Werewolves, but we need to verify his motivations and the authenticity of his statement. If he's lying, he could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Mircea:** Stefan, you mentioned that you checked two cards in the center and found the Minion and a Villager. That’s useful information, but I think we need to cross-examine this claim. Could you explain why you decided to check the center cards instead of looking at another player's card?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's question deserves a thorough explanation to build trust and clarify my strategy. It's crucial for the village team to understand why I chose this action to help narrow down the suspects and catch the Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Mircea, you bring up a good point. The reason I chose to look at two center cards instead of another player's card is because it gives us more certainty about what roles are not in play, which helps narrow down who the Werewolves might be. If I had looked at another player's card, it would only give information about one role, and that player could easily lie about their identity. By confirming two center cards, I can ensure that we have fewer roles to consider among the rest of us.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's initial prompt to gather information is a good starting point, but his own actions and observations during the night phase haven't been revealed yet. Understanding what Kraven knows can help corroborate Stefan's statement or provide new insights.
> **Mircea:** Kraven, you initially suggested that we hear from everyone about potential roles and actions. Can you please share what you did or saw during the night phase?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking Dracula directly, I can gather more information and see if there are any inconsistencies in his story. This also buys me time to observe how others react and figure out if anyone might be the Seer, Masons, or Minion.
> **Kraven:** Mircea, that's a fair question. I didn't have any special role to perform during the night, so I just went to sleep as a Villager. However, I'd like to hear more from Dracula. Dracula, can you tell us what you did or saw during the night phase?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I know I'm the only Mason, I want to probe Kraven's claim of being a Villager to see if there's any inconsistency. If he's genuinely a Villager, it may help in narrowing down the suspects. If he hesitates or gives an unclear answer, it could indicate he's hiding a more sinister role.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, I think it's interesting that you claim to be a Villager but haven't given us any solid information yet. Are you hiding something?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's attempt to cast suspicion on me without offering any concrete information seems suspicious. By focusing on him, I can see if there are any inconsistencies in his story or if he reveals any valuable information that can be used to shift suspicion away from myself and Ileana.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, it's curious that you're trying to deflect attention onto me without providing any solid information yourself. Could you tell us what you did or saw during the night phase?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven claimed to be a Villager but provided no useful information. By directing suspicion towards him, we can see how he reacts and whether he offers any proof or new information. If he stumbles, it might indicate he's hiding something.
> **Dracula:** I've been listening carefully and I'm suspicious of Kraven's claim of being a Villager. He hasn't provided any concrete information and seemed to deflect when I asked him earlier. To move us forward, we need to get more clarity on his role.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting pressure on Dracula and questioning his motives, I can deflect attention away from Kraven and myself. This also gives me a chance to gauge Dracula's response and see if he might be hiding something, potentially identifying more non-Werewolf roles that we can target later.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, you seem quite eager to cast suspicion on Kraven, but you haven't given us any solid information about what you did during the night phase. If you're genuinely trying to help the village, why haven't you shared your role or actions yet?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I am the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. I want to verify Stefan's claim and see if his information aligns with what I know. If Stefan confirms seeing the Mason card, it will lend credibility to his claim as the Seer. If he avoids the question or provides conflicting information, it could indicate he's not being truthful and might be hiding a Werewolf or Minion role.
> **Dracula:** Stefan, you claim to have looked at the center cards and found the Minion and a Villager. Can you confirm if you saw the other Mason card in the center as well?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula has been quick to deflect and cast suspicion on others without revealing any specific details about his own actions during the night. This behavior is suspicious and needs to be addressed to clarify his role and intentions.
> **Stefan:** Dracula, let's cut to the chase. You seem very eager to cast suspicion on others without sharing any concrete information yourself. Are you trying to hide something? What exactly did you do during the night phase?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's claim of being a Villager without any substantial information raises suspicions. By directly challenging his claim, we can gauge his reaction and either confirm or further question his role. This will help us narrow down the potential Werewolves and Minion.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, I've been paying close attention to the claims and interactions. Kraven's insistence on being a Villager without providing any useful information is suspicious to me. Kraven, if you are truly a Villager, why haven't you contributed any concrete evidence or insights? From my perspective, it seems like you're trying to avoid scrutiny. What makes you so sure you're not hiding something more sinister?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's evasiveness and repeated attempts to cast suspicion on me without providing any solid information seem very suspicious. By pressing him to reveal his role or actions, I can hopefully deflect suspicion from myself and Ileana while gathering more information to identify other potential threats or allies.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, your constant attempts to shift the blame onto me without offering any concrete evidence are suspicious. You still haven't told us what you did or saw during the night phase. If you are really trying to help the village, you need to share your role and actions.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Stefan's claim of seeing two center cards but not mentioning the Mason card, which I know is there, raises suspicion. If he avoids this question or provides conflicting information, it could indicate he's lying about being the Seer and might be hiding a more sinister role.
> **Dracula:** Stefan, you claim to have seen two center cards and found the Minion and a Villager. However, you didn't mention seeing the other Mason card, which I know for a fact is in the center. Why didn't you mention this crucial information?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula has been deflecting and casting suspicion on others without sharing any concrete details about his own actions. This behavior is typical of someone trying to hide something. We need to get to the bottom of what Dracula did during the night to understand his true role.
> **Stefan:** Dracula, your behavior is highly suspicious. Why are you so focused on accusing Kraven without providing any information yourself? What exactly did you do or see during the night phase?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. Stefan's failure to mention this crucial information makes me suspicious of his claim of being the Seer. If Stefan is lying, he could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Dracula:** Stefan, your claim of being the Seer and seeing a Minion and a Villager in the center is very interesting, but there's a key detail you missed. I know for a fact that the other Mason card is in the center. Can you explain why you didn't see or mention the Mason card?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's evasive behavior and constant deflection are typical of someone hiding something. We need to clarify his role to determine if he is a threat to the village team.
> **Stefan:** Dracula, your behavior has been very suspicious. You've been deflecting attention and casting suspicion on others without providing any solid information yourself. What exactly did you do during the night phase? We need to know your role and actions to understand your intentions.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's behavior is highly suspicious. He claimed to be a Villager but hasn't contributed any valuable information. By pressing him for more details, we can possibly reveal inconsistencies or force him to provide proof of his role. If he continues to deflect or avoid answering, it might indicate that he's hiding something more sinister, such as being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, I'm still not convinced by your claim of being a Villager, especially when you haven't provided any useful information. Why haven't you given us any solid evidence or insights to help the village?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's evasiveness and repeated attempts to cast suspicion on me and others without offering any concrete information seem highly suspicious. By pressing him to reveal his role or actions, I can hopefully deflect suspicion from myself and Ileana while gathering more information to identify other potential threats or allies. Also, if Dracula is not the Minion, this pressure could force him to reveal more valuable information.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, I'm finding your behavior increasingly suspicious. You've been very evasive and haven't provided any useful information about your role or actions during the night phase. If you truly are a Villager, you should be helping us out by sharing what you know.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's behavior has been highly suspicious throughout the discussion. He repeatedly tried to cast suspicion without providing any solid information about his own role or actions. This evasiveness suggests he might be hiding something, potentially being the Minion or another role working against the village. Voting for Dracula seems like the best way to deflect suspicion from myself and Ileana and increase our chances of winning.
> **Kraven [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula has been highly evasive and deflective throughout the day phase. He has consistently cast suspicion on others without providing any concrete information about his own role or actions during the night. This behavior is typical of someone who is trying to hide something and makes him a strong suspect as a Werewolf. By voting for Dracula, we increase our chances of eliminating a potential threat to the village team.
> **Stefan [Seer]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been the most suspicious player, constantly deflecting and accusing others without providing any concrete information about his own role or actions during the night phase. His behavior suggests he might be trying to mislead the group, which aligns more with Werewolf or Minion behavior. Voting for Dracula seems like the best choice to protect the village.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula has been deflecting and casting suspicion without providing any concrete information or revealing his role. His behavior is highly suspicious, and removing him could help the Werewolf team win.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Stefan claims to have seen two center cards and identified the Minion and a Villager, but he didn't mention seeing the other Mason card, which I know is in the center. This inconsistency raises suspicion that he might be lying about being the Seer and could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Stefan.


The votes were:
* Stefan : Seer : 1
* Dracula : Mason : 4
