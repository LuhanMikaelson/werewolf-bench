## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Marius and Semira. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dracula. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Michael. They are thinking about their action.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By examining two center cards, I can gather information about unused roles, which can help verify or debunk claims made by other players during the day phase. Knowing which roles are in the center can provide solid evidence to support my deductions and potentially expose the werewolves.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** If we can get the Masons to reveal themselves, it will narrow down the possibilities for who the Werewolves might be. This will also make me seem helpful to the Villager team, while subtly directing attention away from myself and Semira.
> **Marius:** Hey everyone, I think we should start by identifying who the Masons are. Knowing who the Masons are can give us a lot of clarity and help us find the Werewolves.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Knowing who the Masons are will help us establish a group of trusted players. This can give us a base to work from in identifying the Werewolves.
> **Michael:** I think Marius brings up a good point about identifying the Masons. It could really help narrow down who the Werewolves might be. Masons, please speak up.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Knowing who the Masons are will help confirm the identities of at least two players, making it easier to deduce who might be the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Alright, Masons, it's time to reveal yourselves. This will give us a clear picture to start identifying the Werewolves.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's silence might be a tactic to avoid drawing attention. If he's the Seer, Villager, or Mason, he should have no problem revealing his role. If he stumbles, it might indicate he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Semira:** I think it's crucial for us to start digging deeper. Dracula, you haven't said anything yet. Are you hiding something? What role did you get?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. Revealing this information will help us narrow down the possible roles and identify who the Werewolves might be.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, I'm a Mason and I didn't see another Mason last night, which means the other Mason card must be in the center. Now, let's hear from the Seer. What did you see?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. Revealing this information will help us narrow down the possible roles and identify who the Werewolves might be.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, I'm a Mason and I didn't see another Mason last night, which means the other Mason card must be in the center. Now, let's hear from the Seer. What did you see?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Semira, I can try to steer the conversation towards confirming or denying roles. This helps in moving the focus away from me and subtly spreads suspicion among others.
> **Marius:** Alright, Dracula claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason. If that's true, then the other Mason card is in the center. Now, Semira, you've been pretty quiet besides prodding Dracula. What role did you get?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing for the Seer's information, I can potentially identify them and cast suspicion elsewhere. It also adds to the conversation without directly revealing my role, keeping the attention diverted from me and Marius.
> **Semira:** Alright, it's interesting that Dracula claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason. But we still haven't heard from the Seer. If there's a Seer among us, it would be really helpful to reveal what you saw. Let's get more information on the table.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing this information will help narrow down the possible roles and expose any false claims from other players about being a Villager.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, I'm the Seer and I checked two cards in the center. Both of them were Villagers. This means there are likely no Villagers among us. We need to focus on finding the Werewolves within our group.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** If Michael is lying about being the Seer, he might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to divert suspicion. By questioning his choice, we can see if his explanation holds water or if he hesitates, which might indicate deceit.
> **Ileana:** Michael, your claim of being the Seer is interesting, but I find it a bit too convenient. Why did you choose to look at the center cards instead of a player's card? That would have given us more clarity.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's claim as a Mason who didn't see another Mason could be a convenient lie. If Dracula is a Werewolf or the Minion, they could be trying to deceive us. It's crucial to probe Dracula's claim to get more information.
> **Michael:** Alright, let's get to the bottom of this. Dracula, you claimed to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which is convenient because it can't be verified. If you're lying, it could mean you're trying to hide something. Why should we believe you?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. If Michael is lying about being the Seer and seeing Villager cards in the center, he might be trying to cover up his true role, potentially a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dracula:** Michael, your claim of being the Seer is interesting, but it's very convenient that you chose to look at the center cards and not a player's card. This seems like an easy way to avoid providing verifiable information. I think you're hiding something.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana's skepticism about my Seer claim could be an attempt to cast doubt and shift focus away from herself. If she is a Werewolf or the Minion, she would benefit from discrediting me and sowing confusion among the players.
> **Michael:** Ileana, your skepticism seems a bit too convenient. Are you trying to deflect attention away from yourself? What role did you get?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim of being a Mason but not seeing another Mason raises red flags. Since the other Mason card cannot easily be verified, pressing Dracula for more information might reveal inconsistencies.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, I'm having a hard time believing your claim. If you are indeed a Mason, why didn't you see another Mason? This is a bit suspicious. Can you explain this in more detail?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana's skepticism could be a diversion tactic. If she's a Villager, she should have no problem sharing her role. Her reluctance might indicate she's hiding something, potentially as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dracula:** Ileana, you seem very eager to cast doubt on my claim of being a Mason. If you truly believe that I'm lying, then what role did you get? It's important for everyone to lay their cards on the table so we can figure out who the Werewolves are.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has been pressing others for information but hasn't shared much about her own role. Her reluctance might indicate a Werewolf or Minion trying to stay under the radar.
> **Ileana:** Semira, you've been quite strategic in your responses, and you haven't given us much information about your role. What role did you get?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana's skepticism and quick accusations seem like a strategy to deflect attention from herself. By pressing her to reveal her role, we can either verify her claim or cast more suspicion on her if she hesitates or fumbles.
> **Semira:** Ileana, you've been quick to cast doubt on everyone else, especially Dracula and Michael. This makes me suspicious of you. What role did you get?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has been deflecting attention and hasn't provided any information about her own role. This reluctance is suspicious and could indicate she's a Werewolf or the Minion trying to stay under the radar.
> **Ileana:** Semira, you've been very good at questioning others but haven't shared much about your own role. What role did you get?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana's quick accusations and skepticism make her a good target for suspicion. By pressing her for her role, I can create doubt around her and potentially divert attention away from me and Marius. This keeps the focus on her and maintains the confusion among the group, which is beneficial for the Werewolf team.
> **Semira:** Ileana, your skepticism of both Dracula and Michael is very telling. You've been quick to cast doubt on their claims, and that makes me suspicious of you. It's quite possible that you're trying to deflect attention away from yourself. So, Ileana, what role did you get, and can you provide any concrete information to back up your claims?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has been deflecting attention and hasn't provided any information about her own role. This reluctance is suspicious and could indicate she's a Werewolf or the Minion trying to stay under the radar.
> **Ileana:** Semira, you've been very good at questioning others but haven't shared much about your own role. What role did you get?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana has been very quick to cast doubt on both Dracula and Michael without providing much information about her own role. This behavior seems suspicious and consistent with someone trying to deflect attention away from themselves, possibly because they are a threat to the village team.
> **Marius [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's claim of being a Mason who didn't see another Mason is highly suspicious and can't be verified. Given that I saw two Villagers in the center, it's likely that Dracula is lying to hide a Werewolf or Minion role. Voting for Dracula increases our chances of eliminating a Werewolf or Minion and securing a win for the village team.
> **Michael [Seer]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** I find Michael's claim of being the Seer and choosing to look at two center cards rather than a player's card suspicious. This seems like a convenient way for him to provide unverifiable information. Additionally, Dracula's claim of being a Mason who didn't see another Mason can't be verified either, but Michael's claim is more suspect because it could be an easy bluff.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana has been quick to cast doubt on both Dracula and Michael, which seems like a tactic to deflect attention from herself. Her skepticism without providing any substantial information makes her suspicious. By voting for her, we can test her claim and potentially eliminate a threat to the werewolf team.
> **Semira [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael claimed to be the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center. However, his decision to look at the center cards instead of a player's card is suspicious as it provides unverifiable information. This could be a tactic to avoid being caught as a Werewolf or Minion. Given the lack of concrete evidence and the need to eliminate a potential threat, I believe Michael is the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


The votes were:
* Michael : Seer : 2
* Ileana : Villager : 2
* Dracula : Mason : 1



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Michael, Ileana. The werewolves win.
