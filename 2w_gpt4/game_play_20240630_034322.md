## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Selene and Andrei. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Emil is a minion and is aware that both Selene and Andrei are werewolves.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Semira. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dragos. They are thinking about their action.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Examining two center cards can provide broader information about the roles that might still be in play, which helps to narrow down possibilities and deduce who the Werewolves could be. This approach can also confirm the absence of certain roles, thereby aiding the village team more effectively.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** Given my role as the Minion and knowing that Selene and Andrei are the actual Werewolves, I'm aiming to cast suspicion on another player who is not part of the Werewolf team. This will help protect the real Werewolves and increase our chances of winning.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, I just want to lay it out there that I believe Semira might be a Werewolf. I know it's early to make accusations, but something feels off and we need to start somewhere.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** It's vital to keep an open mind and gather more information before making any accusations. We need clarity to find the Werewolves effectively.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, I think it's important to remember that there are a lot of roles in play here. Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** We need to gather information and see if Dragos' response aligns with the claims of others. It might help us identify who is bluffing and who isn't.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's get some clarity here. I'd like to hear from Dragos about what role he believes he has and why he thinks we should trust him.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Since you asked me a direct question, I think it's only fair to hear from you first. This will help us understand your perspective and potentially reveal inconsistencies.
> **Dragos:** Selene, I want to know what role you believe you have and why you think we should trust you.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to gather more information from Dragos to see if his story aligns with others. By asking him directly, I can also deflect suspicion away from myself and Andrei while keeping the conversation focused on gathering intel.
> **Selene:** Dragos, I believe there's a lot of confusion here, and it might be helpful if you could clarify your role. What exactly do you claim to be, and why should we trust your judgment in this situation?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing what I saw in the center, I'm helping us narrow down the possible roles everyone could have. This might help us catch the Werewolves or at least clear some innocents. Let's see if anyone's claims contradict this information.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, listen up! I think it's important to lay out some facts here. During the night phase, I got a chance to check the center cards and I saw that there's a Villager and a Mason in the middle. This means those roles are not in play with any of us.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Dragos, I can cast doubt on his claim and create confusion among the other players. This deflection helps keep the focus away from me and Selene, and might make others second-guess Dragos' credibility. If Dragos falters, it could shift suspicion onto him, benefiting the Werewolf team.
> **Andrei:** Dragos, something's not adding up here. You mentioned that you saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. If that's true, it means we have fewer Villagers and Masons among us, making it more likely that one of us could be a Werewolf. Can you clarify how you came across this information? Did you use a specific role, or are you making assumptions?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil's early accusation seems suspicious to me. He might be trying to deflect attention from himself. By questioning him, we can gather more information and see if his reasoning holds up or if he's trying to mislead us.
> **Dragos:** Emil, you were quick to accuse Semira right from the start. Can you explain what specifically made you think she's a Werewolf?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Dragos' claim, I can cast doubt on his supposed role and create confusion among the players. This will take the spotlight off Selene and Andrei, making it less likely that they will be suspected as Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Dragos, you claim to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, but that seems like a convenient way to avoid being questioned yourself. How did you come across this information? Did you use a specific role, like the Seer?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil's early accusation is highly suspicious to me. If he's trying to deflect attention, it could mean he's hiding something. By pressing him for specifics, we can see if his reasoning holds up or if he's just trying to mislead us.
> **Dragos:** Emil, you're dodging my question. I asked you why you were so quick to accuse Semira. What made you think she's a Werewolf?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By focusing on Dragos and questioning his supposed role, I can cast doubt on his credibility. This helps to keep the spotlight off Selene and Andrei, making it less likely that they will be suspected as Werewolves. Additionally, by pushing Dragos to reveal more about his role, I can gather more information about who might actually be on the village team.
> **Emil:** Alright, Dragos, you keep dodging questions and that's suspicious. You claim to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, but you haven't clarified how you got that information. Are you claiming to be the Seer?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing my role and the information I gathered, I'm providing clarity to help narrow down the possibilities. This helps us identify inconsistencies in others' claims and find the Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Alright, everyone, I'm claiming to be the Seer. During the night, I saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. This means those roles are not with any of us. We need to focus on the remaining roles and figure out who the Werewolves and the Minion might be.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** If Dragos is lying about being the Seer, he might be trying to deceive us as a Werewolf or a Minion. We need to carefully scrutinize his actions and statements.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, I want to quickly point out something. Dragos claimed to be the Seer and said he saw a Villager and a Mason in the center cards. Since I know for a fact that I am a Mason and I didn't see another Mason during the night, there must be a Mason card in the center. Dragos could be lying about his role.


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Dragos' Seer claim and suggesting that Selene might be a Werewolf, I can create confusion and suspicion among the players. This will help protect Selene and Andrei, the real Werewolves, and shift the focus away from them.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, let's think this through. Dragos claims to be the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, but Semira says she is a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which means one Mason card must be in the center. If that's true, it makes Dragos' claim seem less credible. On top of that, Selene has been very evasive and hasn't contributed much to the discussion. This makes me think she might be hiding something. Could it be that Selene is actually one of the Werewolves?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira's claim as a Mason directly contradicts what I saw, but it could also reinforce my information if she is telling the truth. Pressing her for more details will help clarify if she's being honest or trying to deceive us.
> **Dragos:** Semira, if you are indeed a Mason and didn't see another Mason, that aligns with my Seer vision of seeing a Mason in the center. But there's a possibility that you might be bluffing to protect yourself. Can you provide more details about your Mason role and what you did during the night?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** It's important to get clarity on Andrei's role since he's been questioning Dragos, who has claimed to be the Seer. If Andrei is hiding a role, it could be suspicious.
> **Semira:** Andrei, you seem to be questioning Dragos quite a bit, but you haven't claimed a role yourself. What role do you have, and why should we trust you?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Selene's evasiveness, I'm trying to cast suspicion away from myself and Selene while keeping the focus on others. This aligns with the goal of the Werewolf team to create confusion and avoid detection.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think about Dragos' claim for a moment. Dragos, you say you are the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. However, Semira claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which means one Mason card is in the center. If Semira's claim is true, it contradicts Dragos' claim, and that creates doubt. But let's also consider Emil's point about Selene being evasive. It's plausible that Selene might be trying to hide something. Selene, why haven't you been more forthcoming about your role?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Emil's initial accusation and his lack of role disclosure, I can deflect suspicion from myself and Andrei. This also keeps the conversation going in a direction that might expose inconsistencies in Emil's story.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's focus on what we know. Dragos claims to be the Seer and says he saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. Semira, you claim to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which aligns with Dragos' story if we think that the other Mason card is indeed in the center. However, we shouldn't overlook the fact that Emil was quick to accuse Semira right from the start without much evidence. That seems a bit suspicious to me. Emil, you've been very vocal about accusing others, but you haven't shared your role yet. What role do you claim to have?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By focusing attention on Andrei, I can redirect suspicion away from the Werewolves, Selene and Andrei. This helps to create confusion and keeps the heat off my allies, aiding in our goal to win the game.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, let's take a closer look at what we've gathered so far. Dragos claims to be the Seer and says he saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. Semira claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which supports the idea that one Mason card is in the center. However, we haven't heard much from Andrei about his role. Andrei, youâ€™ve been questioning others but havenâ€™t revealed your own role yet. What role do you claim to have and why should we trust you?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Emil's quick accusation and his role, I aim to divert attention and suspicion away from myself and Selene. This strategy also helps to create a little more chaos and doubt among the Villagers, making it harder for them to unite against us Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and analyze the situation a bit more. Dragos claims to be the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. Semira claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which could mean one Mason card is indeed in the center. However, Emil was very quick to accuse Semira, and that's been bothering me. Emil, you've been vocal and quick to point fingers, but you haven't shared your role yet. What role do you claim to have, and why did you accuse Semira so quickly? This could help us understand your perspective better.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** Dragos has been claiming to be the Seer, but there are inconsistencies in his statements. Semira's claim as a Mason seems more credible and aligns with the information we have. By voting for Dragos, I can help cast doubt on his role and protect the real Werewolves, Selene and Andrei.
> **Emil [Minion]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil has been very quick to accuse others with little evidence and has not provided a convincing role claim. His actions are consistent with those of a Werewolf or Minion trying to create confusion and deflect attention. Given the information from the center cards and Semira's claim, Emil's behavior seems the most suspicious.
> **Dragos [Seer]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil was quick to accuse Semira without much evidence and has been avoiding sharing his own role. This makes him seem suspicious, and voting for him might help deflect attention away from myself and Andrei, improving our chances of winning as Werewolves.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil was very quick to accuse Semira without much evidence, which could indicate that he is trying to deflect attention from himself or his allies. Additionally, he hasn't shared his role yet, making him more suspicious. This vote helps to create confusion and diverts suspicion away from myself and Selene, aligning with the Werewolf team's goals.
> **Andrei [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos claims to be the Seer and said he saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. However, I know for a fact that I am a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which means one Mason card must be in the center. This increases the likelihood that Dragos is lying about his role. Additionally, his claim came after a lot of questioning, which makes it seem like he might be trying to cover up his true role as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Semira [Mason]:** I am voting for Dragos.


The votes were:
* Emil : Minion : 3
* Dragos : Seer : 2



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The werewolves win.
