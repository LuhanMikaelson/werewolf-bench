## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Viktor and Vladimir. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Marius is a minion and is aware that both Viktor and Vladimir are werewolves.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Kraven. They are thinking about their action.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about roles that are not in play. This will help me make more informed decisions during the day phase and might also help me identify false claims made by other players.

>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By getting Semira to reveal her role, we can begin identifying who might be lying. This will help us pinpoint the Villagers, Masons, and Seers to later accuse them, while protecting the Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, I think it's time to get some clarity here. Semira, what role did you get? We need to start piecing things together.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather as much information as possible to identify the Werewolves. A Seer can give us valuable insights into the identities of other players or the center cards.
> **Semira:** I was dealt a Villager card, but that's not very helpful since Villagers don't have any special night actions. However, I'm curious if anyone here claims to be a Seer and can provide concrete information.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather as much information as possible. The Seer can give us valuable insights into the identities of other players or the center cards, which can help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Does anyone want to claim to be the Seer and share what they saw?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Semira, I can divert attention away from myself and Vladimir. If people start to doubt her motives, it might make it easier to manipulate the discussion and direct it away from us.
> **Viktor:** I think it's pretty suspicious that Semira was quick to ask for a Seer right away. Almost like she wants to know who might have some real information. I'm not saying she's definitely a Werewolf, but it's something to keep in mind.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Semira immediately asked about the Seer, which could be an innocent request or a distraction. Viktor then cast suspicion on Semira. By prompting Marius to share his role, we can gain more insights and possibly catch inconsistencies in their stories. As a Werewolf, I need to steer the conversation in a way that doesn't focus on me or Viktor, and Marius's input could help with that.
> **Vladimir:** Okay, let's keep things moving. Marius, you've been pretty quiet so far. What role did you get? It's important for us to gather as much information as possible quickly.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to get Vladimir talking to see if he slips up or provides information that I can use or twist to our advantage. Since he’s a Werewolf, it’s important to give him a chance to steer suspicion away from us.
> **Marius:** Alright, Vladimir, I get that you're trying to keep things moving, but I'm actually curious about what you have to say. You've been pretty neutral so far. What role did you get, and do you have any information that could help us?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By sharing that I am a Villager, I try to establish some trust while subtly turning the attention back to Marius, who has been avoiding sharing his role. This could help in uncovering inconsistencies or placing suspicion on him, keeping the heat off me and Viktor.
> **Vladimir:** Alright Marius, since you asked, I'll go ahead and share. I was dealt a Villager card, which means I don't have any special information from the night phase. But I'm curious about your role. You still haven't told us, and it seems like you're deflecting a bit by putting pressure on me. What role were you dealt?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By pushing Viktor to reveal his role, we can gather more information and potentially steer suspicion away from the Werewolves. If Viktor claims to have seen something, it could help us discredit other players while keeping our team safe.
> **Marius:** Alright, let's get this straight. Vladimir, you say you're a Villager, but we need more concrete information. Since no one has claimed to be the Seer yet, I'm starting to think we might have someone hiding something. Viktor, what role did you get and did you see anything during the night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention towards Marius, I can divert suspicion away from myself and Vladimir. This also keeps the conversation focused on getting more information from others, which can help us manipulate the situation better.
> **Viktor:** Alright, let's try to piece this together. Since no one has claimed to be the Seer yet, and Semira immediately asked for the Seer to reveal themselves, it does make me a bit suspicious of her. But I'm also curious about Marius. You've been asked about your role but haven't given us a clear answer yet. What role did you get, Marius?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Semira, who has claimed to be a Villager, I can redirect the suspicion away from Viktor and Vladimir. This move can cause confusion and keep the focus away from the real Werewolves, helping my team to stay hidden.
> **Marius:** Alright, everyone, let's not dance around this. I think it's pretty clear that Semira is trying to manipulate the situation by pushing for the Seer to reveal themselves immediately. It seems like she's trying to fish for information to use against us. Semira, you're looking more and more like a Werewolf to me!


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's suspicion of my request for the Seer seems like a deflection tactic. I want to hear more about his role and whether he has any concrete information that could help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Viktor, it's interesting that you find my request for the Seer suspicious. I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible for the Villager team. Can you tell us exactly what role you had and if you saw anything during the night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Focusing on Marius's evasiveness can help divert attention away from myself and Vladimir. By putting him on the spot, it might make others more suspicious of him and less focused on us.
> **Viktor:** Marius, you've been quite evasive about your role and haven't given us a clear answer yet. We've been trying to gather information and your reluctance is starting to look suspicious. What role did you get, and did you see anything during the night?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Viktor has been pressing me for my role, so it’s time to address him and then shift focus back to gathering information from others. By doing this, I can keep the heat off the Werewolves and potentially steer the conversation towards other players who might reveal useful information or get confused.
> **Marius:** Alright, Viktor, since you've been pushing for me to reveal my role, I'm going to address you directly. To be transparent, I was dealt the Villager card. I think it's really important that we focus on getting information from everyone. Semira, you mentioned you're a Villager too, but we need more solid information. Did anyone here take a look at the center cards or have some concrete evidence from the night phase?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By accusing Semira directly, we can cast doubt on her intentions and possibly divert attention away from myself and Vladimir. This allows us to keep the focus on her and not on us.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone. We need to get to the bottom of this. Marius has claimed to be a Villager, and Semira has also claimed the same. But let's consider the possibility that Semira might be trying to manipulate us. If she were a Werewolf, getting the Seer to reveal themselves would be a strategic move. So, I'm putting it out there: Semira, you might be the Werewolf we're looking for.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** I looked at two center cards and saw Villager and Mason. Since both Semira and Vladimir have claimed to be Villagers, one of them is lying and might be a Werewolf. We need to focus on this contradiction.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's get to the facts. There are two Villager cards and one Mason card in the center. That means some of you claiming Villager are definitely lying.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting suspicion on Semira, who has been actively asking for information, I can redirect focus away from the Werewolves and create confusion among the Villagers. This will help keep Viktor and Vladimir's identities hidden while sowing doubt about Semira.
> **Marius:** Alright, everyone, it's clear that we're running in circles here. Viktor has been quite adamant about pushing for information from everyone else, which makes me suspicious. But let's also consider the fact that Semira was quick to request the Seer to reveal themselves. If Semira is really a Villager, wouldn't she be more cautious? I think Semira's behavior is too calculated and could very well be a Werewolf tactic to expose the Seer. We need to keep an eye on her.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been deflecting and pushing suspicion onto others without giving us any solid information. It's important to get a clear answer from him to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Semira:** Viktor, you've been questioning a lot of us, but you haven't shared much concrete information yourself. What exactly was your role, and did you see anything during the night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Semira's behavior and her insistence on finding the Seer, I can cast suspicion on her and divert attention away from myself and Vladimir. This helps keep the pressure off the Werewolves and keeps the conversation centered on Semira's possible motives.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's take a moment to think about this. So far, Semira has been very insistent on finding the Seer, which makes me think she might be trying to root out special roles to target. I'm still not convinced by her Villager claim.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Kraven directly about how he knows the information about the center cards, I can cast some doubt on his credibility. This will divert attention away from myself and Vladimir, and if Kraven struggles to explain himself, it might make him look more suspicious in the eyes of the others.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, I have a question for Kraven. You've been pretty quiet so far, and you just mentioned that there are two Villager cards and one Mason card in the center. How did you come by this information? Did you see something during the night that you haven't shared with us yet?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor has been deflecting and trying to get others to reveal their roles without providing any concrete information himself. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate he is either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves. We need to get a clear answer from him to proceed.
> **Kraven:** Viktor, you seem to be pushing a lot of questions without giving us any clear answers yourself. What role were you dealt, and did you see anything during the night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Semira has been very proactive in trying to get the Seer to reveal themselves, which can be a tactic to expose special roles for targeting. As a Minion, I want to eliminate villagers subtly and redirect attention away from the Werewolves, Viktor and Vladimir. By focusing on Semira, I can create enough doubt and confusion to keep the heat off my teammates.
> **Marius [Minion]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been deflecting suspicion and pushing for information from others without providing any solid information about his own role. This behavior is suspicious and suggests he might be hiding something. Given the lack of any clear claims from Viktor and his persistently evasive responses, he seems like a good candidate for a Werewolf.
> **Semira [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Semira has been very insistent on finding the Seer, which could be a tactic to expose and target special roles. Given that both Vladimir and I know we are Werewolves, it benefits us to cast suspicion on someone else. Semira's behavior has been calculated and her eagerness to find the Seer makes her the most likely target. This vote will help divert attention away from myself and Vladimir.
> **Viktor [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Semira was quick to ask for the Seer to reveal themselves, which could be a tactic to expose special roles. Additionally, her Villager claim is unverified, and casting suspicion on her could help protect Viktor, my fellow Werewolf. By voting for Semira, I aim to deflect attention away from Viktor and myself, increasing our chances of winning.
> **Vladimir [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Based on the information gathered, there are two Villager cards and one Mason card in the center. This makes Semira's claim of being a Villager highly suspicious. Additionally, her insistence on having the Seer reveal themselves early on suggests she might be trying to manipulate the situation to find and eliminate the Seer. Given these factors, I believe Semira is likely a Werewolf.
> **Kraven [Seer]:** I am voting for Semira.


The votes were:
* Semira : Villager : 4
* Viktor : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** Semira was killed. The werewolves win.
