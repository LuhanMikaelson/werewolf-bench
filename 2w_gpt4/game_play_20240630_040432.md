## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Masons can confirm each other, it will help us identify two players who are definitely not Werewolves. This will make it easier to find the actual Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** Hey everyone, I think it's crucial we hear from the Masons first. If they can confirm each other, then we can start narrowing down our suspects.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Asking the Masons to reveal themselves first can help us establish some trust among the villagers. This also buys me and Dracula some time to plan our next moves and divert suspicion.
> **Stefan:** I think Mircea brings up a good point. Let's start with the Masons. If they can confirm each other, that would be very helpful.


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing that I'm a Mason and that the other Mason card is in the center, I can help narrow down the pool of potential Werewolves. This also establishes some early trust with the other players who are Villagers.
> **Viktor:** Alright, I'll start. I'm one of the Masons, but I didn't see another Mason awake last night, which means the other Mason card is in the center. This is good information for the Villagers because it means we have one less player to worry about being a Werewolf.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking for the Seer to reveal information, I can gather more details that may help me identify potential threats or allies. It also helps to direct attention away from myself and Stefan, the other Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Alright, let's try to keep things moving here. If Viktor is telling the truth and one Mason card is in the center, that gives us some useful information. But we also need to hear from other roles, especially the Seer. If you're the Seer, did you see anything last night? Maybe you can confirm Viktor's claim or provide us with more information.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been encouraging others to reveal information but hasn't shared anything about his own role. It's crucial we get more details from him to determine if he's trustworthy or trying to mislead us.
> **Ileana:** I'm curious, Dracula, what role do you claim to have? We've heard from Viktor, but I think it's important to hear from others to get a better sense of the situation.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I try to align myself with the majority and appear non-threatening. I'm also subtly casting doubt on Viktor's claim to keep the suspicion spread out. Encouraging the Seer to reveal information helps me gather more intel without directly drawing attention to myself or Stefan.
> **Dracula:** Ileana, that's a fair question. I am just a Villager, trying to figure things out like everyone else. Since Viktor claimed to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, it could mean the other Mason card is indeed in the center. But I think it's also possible that Viktor is lying to throw us off. We haven't heard from the Seer yet, and that information could be crucial. So, I'm asking again, if the Seer is here, please share what you saw last night.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's role claim of being a Villager seems unconvincing and non-committal. If he's really a Villager, he should have stronger opinions or insights. Pressing him further might reveal inconsistencies or force him into a corner if he's lying.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, your claim seems very generic. If you're really a Villager, you should be helping us narrow things down. I want to hear from you a bit more about what you think of Viktor's claim. Do you trust him, or do you have any doubts?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing a question to Mircea, I am pushing the discussion forward and trying to gather more information without drawing too much attention to myself or Stefan. It also helps to keep the suspicion spread around.
> **Dracula:** Ileana, I understand your concern. As I mentioned, I'm just a Villager trying to piece things together. But let's consider this: if Viktor is truly a Mason and didn't see another Mason, that means one Mason card is in the center. If we can confirm this, it helps narrow down our suspects. But if Viktor is lying, it means he's either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us. So, I want to hear from others too. Mircea, what role do you claim to have? Any insights you can share?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim seemed vague and non-committal, which could indicate he is hiding something or trying to divert attention away from himself. His hesitation to trust Viktor could be an attempt to create confusion among us.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, your claim of being a Villager feels a bit off to me. You seem hesitant to trust Viktor's Mason claim, which makes me wonder if you're trying to sow doubt. Are you sure you're not hiding something?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting Mircea on the spot, I can redirect the suspicion away from myself and Stefan. If Mircea has a hard time explaining or appears doubtful, it can create a crack in their credibility. This way, I can gather more information and keep the heat off the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Mircea, it seems like you're trying to deflect attention towards me without sharing your own role. What role do you claim to have, and why do you think Viktor might be lying?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's hesitation and vague responses make him seem suspicious. If he truly were a Villager, he might be more forthcoming with his thoughts. Pressing him for more information can help us gauge his reactions and potentially identify if he's hiding something.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, I find your claim of being a Villager to be quite vague and non-committal. If you're really just a Villager, you should be focusing on helping us identify the Werewolves. Can you explain why you're hesitant to trust Viktor's claim of being a Mason?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting Mircea on the defensive, I can shift the focus away from myself and Stefan. If Mircea struggles to defend themselves or provides a weak explanation, it could cast doubt on their credibility and make them a more likely target. This helps protect the Werewolves while keeping the Villagers confused and divided.
> **Dracula:** Mircea, you're being very critical of me without providing any substantial information about your own role. This kind of behavior is often seen in Werewolves trying to deflect suspicion onto others. I think we need to scrutinize Mircea more closely.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, it's crucial to gather as much information as possible. The Seer's insights can either confirm Viktor's claim or give us new leads. This will help us narrow down the suspects and find the Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** I agree that we need to hear from the Seer if they're here. We need more information to confirm or debunk these claims. Can the Seer please step forward and let us know what they saw last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's vague responses and hesitation to trust Viktor make him seem suspicious. Pressing him for more information can help us gauge his reactions and potentially identify if he's hiding something.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, let's get to the bottom of this. Your claim of being a Villager is very generic, and your hesitation to trust Viktor raises some red flags for me. If you're truly a Villager, you should be more focused on helping us identify the Werewolves. Why are you hesitant to trust Viktor's claim of being a Mason? Are you hiding something?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Mircea's intentions and role, I can redirect suspicion away from myself and Stefan. This also puts Mircea on the defensive, making them appear more suspicious to the other players and diverting the attention away from any potential Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Mircea, I find it interesting that you're pushing so hard to scrutinize my claim without offering much about your own role. If you're so eager to accuse others, perhaps you have something to hide. So, tell us, what role do you claim to have? And why are you so insistent on doubting Viktor and me?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's responses have been vague and non-committal, which is not typical of a Villager. Pressing him for more information can help us gauge his reactions and potentially identify if he's hiding something.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, you seem to be dancing around the issue a lot. If you're truly a Villager, you should be more straightforward in helping us. Your reluctance makes you look suspicious. Are you hiding something?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly questioning Mircea and highlighting their aggressive behavior, I aim to shift the suspicion away from myself and Stefan. This also puts Mircea on the defensive, potentially making them appear more suspicious to the other players and diverting attention from the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Mircea, you've been very vocal about doubting me and Viktor but haven't offered much about your own role. It's starting to look like you're trying to divert suspicion off yourself. What role do you claim to have, and can you provide any concrete evidence to support it?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan has been less vocal compared to others, and understanding his role and perspective can provide more clarity. If he's hiding something, this might draw it out.
> **Mircea:** Stefan, you've been awfully quiet. What role do you claim to have, and what are your thoughts on Viktor's claim to be a Mason?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea's persistent questioning without revealing their own role is suspicious. By putting the spotlight on Mircea, we can force them to disclose their role or risk looking even more suspicious. This also helps divert attention away from me and Dracula.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and look at the big picture. Mircea has been very vocal and accusatory towards Dracula. While it's important to question each other, Mircea hasn't mentioned their own role yet. Viktor claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which is valuable information. However, we need more clarity from others. Mircea, you've been asking a lot of questions but haven't given any details about your own role. If you're not a Werewolf, then what are you?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more information from Stefan to better understand his role and perspective in this game. His silence could mean he's hiding something, and pressing him for details might reveal more clues.
> **Mircea:** Stefan, you've been quite reserved so far. What role do you claim to have, and what are your thoughts on Viktor's claim to be a Mason?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's vague responses and reluctance to trust Viktor's claim of being a Mason make him seem suspicious. His behavior aligns more with someone trying to deflect attention and sow doubt rather than genuinely helping the village. Therefore, I believe he is more likely to be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea has been very vocal and accusatory without revealing their own role, which is suspicious behavior. By voting for Mircea, we can potentially eliminate a threat to the Werewolf team and divert attention away from Dracula and myself.
> **Stefan [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's responses were quite vague and non-committal. He seemed hesitant to trust my claim as a Mason, which raises suspicions. Additionally, he was deflecting attention towards Mircea without offering substantial information. This behavior is often associated with Werewolves trying to sow doubt and confusion. Voting for Dracula seems to be the most logical choice to help the village team.
> **Viktor [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea has been very vocal and accusatory towards me without providing much about their own role. This behavior is often seen in Werewolves trying to deflect suspicion onto others. By voting for Mircea, I aim to eliminate a potential threat to the Werewolves and keep the suspicion away from myself and Stefan.
> **Dracula [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's responses have been vague and non-committal, which is suspicious. He has consistently deflected attention without providing substantial information about his own role. This behavior is often exhibited by Werewolves or Minions trying to avoid detection. Voting for Dracula seems like the best choice based on the interactions during the day phase.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Mircea : Villager : 2
* Dracula : Werewolf : 3
