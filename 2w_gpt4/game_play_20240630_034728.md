## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking about the Seer's information, I can gather more clues about who might be the Seer, Masons, or villagers. This will help me and Stefan avoid suspicion and possibly identify whom to target later.
> **Ileana:** Hey everyone, I've been thinking about the roles we have in this game and the possibility that the Seer might have some useful information. Given the number of special roles, it's important for us to figure out who is who. Can anyone who got a glimpse of the center cards or other players share what they saw?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** The Seer can provide crucial information that can help us identify the Werewolves. By encouraging the Seer to speak up, we can gather more information to make better decisions.
> **Emil:** I think it’s important for us to identify the Seer. If you are the Seer and you have any valuable information, please share it now.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana is prompting others to share information, which could either be a helpful move as a Villager or a tactic to gather information as a Werewolf or Minion. It's worth probing her intentions to see if she gives away any clues about her role.
> **Michael:** Ileana, you mentioned that the Seer might have some useful information. Are you trying to suggest that you might have some information yourself? Or are you just trying to prompt the Seer to come forward?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By prompting Michael to share information, I can gauge his reaction and possibly gather clues about his role. This also helps me deflect suspicion and appear cooperative.
> **Ileana:** Michael, I'm just trying to get the conversation started and see if anyone has any valuable information to share. I think we should all be open about what we know to help the Village team. For instance, if someone is a Mason, they can help confirm each other's identities. Michael, do you have any information you can share from the night phase?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's eagerness to prompt others to share information could either be a genuine attempt to help the Village or a tactic to gather information for the Werewolf team. By questioning her motives, I can see how she responds and potentially gather more clues about her true role.
> **Michael:** Ileana, you seem very eager to get information out of everyone. Are you trying to hide something or just genuinely trying to help the Village team?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Emil's motives, I can gauge his reaction and potentially cast suspicion on him. This also diverts attention away from me and Stefan while keeping the conversation focused on figuring out roles without revealing too much.
> **Ileana:** Emil, I understand why you want to identify the Seer, but I'm curious why you're so focused on that. Do you have any particular reason to believe that the Seer has crucial information we need? Or are you just trying to steer the conversation in a specific direction?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's responses have been more about questioning Ileana's intentions rather than contributing information. This could be a tactic to distract us or avoid revealing his own role, which makes me suspicious of him.
> **Emil:** Michael, you seem to be deflecting a lot of questions back at Ileana instead of providing your own information. Why don't you share what you know from the night phase?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to get everyone talking and sharing information. Stefan's silence could either mean he's a Villager without any special information or he's trying to hide his role. By prompting him to speak, we might gather more clues.
> **Michael:** Stefan, you've been pretty quiet so far. Do you have any information to share from the night phase? Any clues or observations?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** We need to get the conversation moving productively. By urging everyone to provide concrete information, we can hopefully flush out some roles and maybe even catch someone in a lie. This also helps me seem like I'm genuinely trying to help the Village team, even though my goal is the opposite.
> **Stefan:** Alright, everyone, it seems like there's a lot of back-and-forth going on without much concrete information. Let's try to focus here. If anyone has any solid evidence or saw anything during the night, now's the time to share. The longer we beat around the bush, the more likely it is that the Werewolves will slip through our fingers.


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** By encouraging players to reveal their roles, I can gather more information and potentially push suspicion towards the true Villagers, Masons, or Seers, helping protect Ileana and Stefan, who are the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Everyone, I've been thinking about how we can narrow down the possibilities here. Someone mentioned earlier that identifying the Seer could be crucial. I think if the Seer has any solid information, it would really help us make an informed decision. Also, anyone who claims to be a Villager should step forward too. We've got three Villager cards in play, so if we can confirm some of them, it might help us pinpoint the Werewolves.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing suspicion towards Emil and questioning his motives, I can shift the focus away from myself and Ileana. This also encourages Emil to reveal more information, which could be useful for identifying potential Villagers, Masons, or the Seer.
> **Stefan:** Emil, you've been adamant about identifying the Seer early on. I'm starting to wonder if you're trying to protect someone, or perhaps you have information you're not sharing. Could you tell us more about why you're so focused on the Seer?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan has been trying to steer the conversation towards concrete information, which is good. By directing a question to him, we can hopefully get some useful details and see if his intentions are truly aligned with the Village team.
> **Emil:** Stefan, you're right that we need to focus. So, let's get straight to it. Do you have any specific information from the night phase that could help us identify the Werewolves?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By accusing Michael directly, we can shift the focus onto him and see how he reacts. This will also help to divert suspicion away from Ileana and myself. Additionally, if Michael is not a Werewolf, but rather a Villager or some other role, this accusation might cause confusion and benefit us in the long run.
> **Stefan:** Michael, earlier you were quite defensive and focused on Ileana's questions. I'm starting to think you're trying to deflect attention away from yourself. Could it be that you're hiding something? Are you the Werewolf, Michael?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan is pushing for answers from Emil and myself, which could be a tactic to shift focus away from himself. By questioning his motives, we might get a better sense of whether he’s genuinely trying to help the village or if he has something to hide.
> **Michael:** Stefan, you’ve been pretty straightforward, but I'm noticing that you're pushing a lot of attention towards me and Emil. Are you trying to deflect from your own role? Why so eager to accuse others instead of sharing more about what you might know?


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing a question towards Andrei, I can put him on the spot and divert attention away from both myself and Ileana. If Andrei stumbles or hesitates, it may create suspicion around him, allowing the focus to shift away from the Werewolves. This also helps gather more information that could be useful for identifying roles or potential threats.
> **Stefan:** Andrei, you seem to be focusing a lot on how we can narrow down the possibilities, but you haven't shared much about what you might know from the night phase. Are you trying to steer the conversation away from yourself? Can you tell us what you saw or did last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** Michael's defensiveness and his focus on Ileana without providing concrete information himself makes him a prime suspect. By accusing him, I'll divert attention from Ileana and Stefan, the real Werewolves, and potentially get the Villagers to vote for an innocent player, causing confusion.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. Michael, you've been deflecting questions and being defensive since the start. That's pretty suspicious behavior if you ask me. I think Michael might be one of the Werewolves.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's quick accusation towards me without providing any evidence is suspicious. By questioning him directly, I want to see if he has anything solid to back up his claim, or if he's trying to deflect attention away from himself.
> **Michael:** Andrei, you're accusing me pretty quickly without sharing any concrete information yourself. What exactly did you see or do last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting pressure on Michael, I can divert attention away from Ileana and Stefan and make Michael look more suspicious to the other players. His defensiveness gives me a good opportunity to make him the primary suspect.
> **Andrei:** Michael, your defensiveness and reluctance to share any concrete information is very suspicious. What exactly did you see or do last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's insistence on finding the Seer could be an attempt to gather information for the Werewolf team. By questioning his motives, we might uncover whether he has any concrete information or if he's trying to steer the conversation away from himself.
> **Michael:** Emil, you've been very focused on identifying the Seer from the beginning. Can you explain why you're so adamant about this? Do you have any information that could help us identify the Werewolves?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's responses have been deflective and aimed at avoiding giving any real information. This kind of behavior is highly suspicious, and it’s time we call it out. If Michael is the Werewolf, we need to act now to protect the Village team.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, we've been dancing around the issue for too long. Michael has been excessively defensive and evasive. I'm starting to think Michael might actually be one of the Werewolves.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Michael has been defensive and evasive throughout the discussion, which has raised suspicion among the other players. By focusing on Michael, we can divert attention away from Stefan and me, increasing our chances of winning as Werewolves. Additionally, other players like Emil and Andrei also seem to suspect Michael, which makes it easier to get a majority vote against him.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the conversation, Michael has consistently deflected questions and avoided sharing any concrete information. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with the tactics a Werewolf might employ to avoid detection. By voting for Michael, we increase our chances of eliminating a Werewolf and protecting the Village team.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's insistence on identifying the Seer and his accusations towards me without providing clear information seem suspicious. This behavior is consistent with someone trying to gather information for the Werewolf team or deflect attention away from themselves. I believe Emil might be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Michael [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** Michael's defensiveness and reluctance to share concrete information, combined with his focus on Ileana without contributing much himself, makes him the most suspicious player. This aligns with my goal as a Minion to protect the Werewolves, Ileana and Stefan, and create confusion among the Villagers.
> **Andrei [Minion]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Michael has been consistently defensive and evasive throughout the discussion. By shifting the focus onto him, it increases the likelihood that the other players will vote for him, thereby protecting the Werewolf team. Additionally, there's already some momentum towards suspecting Michael, which makes this vote more likely to succeed.
> **Stefan [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


The votes were:
* Emil : Villager : 1
* Michael : Villager : 4



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The werewolves win.
