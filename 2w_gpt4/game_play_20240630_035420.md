## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** If Selene claims a role with a night action, it will help us cross-check her story with others and possibly identify inconsistencies. This can give us a clue about who might be lying and narrow down our suspects.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, everyone, let's get some clarity here. I think we should hear from someone who might have more information. Selene, did you happen to use any special ability last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing that I’m a Mason and that the other Mason card is in the center, it should help build trust with other villagers and narrow down the possible Werewolves among you, Andrei, Lucian, and Viktor.
> **Selene:** I did have a special ability last night, Alexandra. I was able to confirm that the other Mason card is in the center.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Asking Lucian about his night actions could help us gather more information and potentially identify inconsistencies or lies. If he's hesitant or gives a vague answer, it might indicate that he's hiding something.
> **Selene:** Lucian, what did you do last night? Did you have any special abilities?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather more information from the other players and see if Andrei has any useful insights or if his response raises any suspicions.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, let's step back and think this through. Selene claims to be a Mason and said the other Mason card is in the center. If that's true, we need to focus on identifying the Werewolves quickly. Andrei, have you seen anything that could help us figure out who's lying here?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra initiated the conversation and might have more information. It's important to clarify her role to ensure we are on the right track.
> **Andrei:** Alright, let's think about this carefully. Selene claims to be a Mason and says the other Mason card is in the center. If this is true, we need to verify the other roles. Alexandra, you started the discussion and asked Selene about her role. Do you have any special abilities or information that can help us identify the Werewolves?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Lucian, I can potentially gather more information and see if his story aligns or conflicts with others. This can help us identify inconsistencies and narrow down our suspects, while keeping suspicion away from myself and Viktor.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, let's think this through logically. Selene claims to be a Mason and says the other Mason card is in the center. That’s fine for now, but it doesn't give us the complete picture. Lucian, you haven't shared much yet. Did you have any special role or action last night? Maybe you can help us cross-verify some information.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible to identify the Werewolves. Viktor's input could provide crucial details or reveal inconsistencies in others' stories.
> **Lucian:** Viktor, you haven't spoken up yet. Did you have any special role or action last night that can help us narrow down the suspects?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** We need to gather more information to make an informed decision. Lucian has been relatively quiet, and it's important to hear from everyone to spot inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's think this through carefully. From what we've gathered so far, Selene claims to be a Mason and has said the other Mason card is in the center. That's good information. Lucian hasn't shared much yet, and I'm curious to hear more from him. Lucian, can you tell us more about your role or any actions you might have taken last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor hasn't given any new information and keeps pushing the focus back on me. This deflecting behavior is suspicious and could indicate he's trying to avoid scrutiny. Let's see how he responds under pressure.
> **Lucian:** Viktor, you seem to be deflecting questions back to me without providing any real insights. I'm starting to get suspicious of you. Did you wake up at night with a special role, or are you trying to hide something?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian has been relatively quiet and is now trying to cast suspicion on me. It's important to get him to talk more to see if we can catch any inconsistencies in his story, which might help divert attention away from me and Alexandra.
> **Viktor:** Lucian, you seem pretty quick to turn the spotlight on me without giving much information about yourself. Are you hiding something? I haven't seen any convincing evidence yet. Lucian, can you explain your role and actions from last night a bit more clearly?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra has been guiding the discussion without sharing any personal information. This could be a tactic to stay under the radar, which makes me suspicious of her. It's time to press her for concrete details and see if she slips up.
> **Lucian:** Alexandra, you've been playing it safe by asking questions but not revealing anything about your role. Are you hiding something? Maybe you're trying to deflect attention from yourself. Did you wake up with any special role last night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking Andrei, who has been relatively quiet, to share more information, we can gather additional insights or create potential inconsistencies in his story. This can help keep the focus away from myself and Viktor, and possibly cast more suspicion on other players.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, let's think this through with some logic and clarity. Selene claims to be a Mason and says the other Mason card is in the center. That’s one piece of the puzzle. Now, Lucian is hesitant to share anything concrete, and Viktor is deflecting questions back to Lucian without providing any real insights. This back-and-forth isn't helping us. We need to focus on getting clear answers and cross-verifying information. Andrei, you've been quiet after your initial question. Do you have any special role or information that can help us identify the Werewolves?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been dodging questions and not providing any clear information, which is suspicious. We need him to clarify his actions to verify his role and help identify the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Lucian, you've been pretty evasive so far. Selene has claimed to be a Mason, and if she's telling the truth, it helps us narrow things down. Can you clearly explain your role and actions from last night? We need to get to the bottom of this and find the Werewolves.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been asking questions and analyzing but hasn't given any personal information. Pushing him to reveal his role could help us gather more data or catch him in a lie if he's a Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** Andrei, you've been quite analytical, but I realize you haven't shared your own role. Are you hiding something from us? It's crucial for everyone to share their information.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has not given any clear information and has been deflecting questions, which is very suspicious. We need to get to the bottom of his role to identify if he is a Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** Lucian, you’ve been dodging questions and being evasive all day. It’s really suspicious. Are you hiding something? Can you tell us your role and actions from last night clearly?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra has been asking others questions but hasn't shared any personal information. This could be a tactic to stay under the radar and avoid suspicion. It's time to press her for concrete details and see if she slips up.
> **Lucian:** Alexandra, you've been guiding the discussion without revealing anything about your own role. Are you hiding something? Did you have any special role or action last night that can help us identify the Werewolves?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian's evasiveness and tendency to question others without providing substantial information makes him a prime target to shift suspicion away from myself and Viktor. By accusing him, I can redirect the focus and potentially create more doubt among the other players regarding his role.
> **Alexandra:** Lucian, you've been evading questions and not giving us any clear information, which is really suspicious. You've been quick to point fingers at Viktor without backing up your own story. Why should we believe anything you're saying? Are you trying to hide the fact that you're a Werewolf?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei has been analytical but hasn't revealed his role, which could mean he's trying to avoid suspicion. Pressing him might reveal inconsistencies or useful information.
> **Lucian:** Andrei, you've been avoiding sharing personal information and instead focusing on asking others questions. Could you tell us your role and any special actions you took last night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's evasiveness and reluctance to provide clear information are highly suspicious. We need to press him for details to determine if he is a Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** Lucian, you’ve been dodging questions and being evasive all day. It’s really suspicious. Are you hiding something? Can you tell us your role and actions from last night clearly?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra has been directing questions without offering any information about her own role. This could be a tactic to avoid suspicion and stay under the radar. We need to press her for concrete details to gather more data or catch her in a lie if she's a Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** Alexandra, you've been guiding the discussion without revealing anything about your own role. Are you hiding something? Did you have any special role or action last night that can help us identify the Werewolves?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian has been evasive and has not provided clear information about his role, which makes him suspicious. Accusing him can divert attention away from myself and Viktor, increasing our chances of winning as Werewolves.
> **Alexandra [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian has been evasive and hasn't shared any concrete information about his role or night actions, which is highly suspicious. His deflection of questions back to others without providing his own insights further suggests he might be hiding something. Given that I am confident in my Mason role and knowing the other Mason card is in the center, voting for Lucian seems the best way to identify a potential Werewolf.
> **Selene [Mason]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been consistently evasive and deflective throughout the discussion, which is highly suspicious. He hasn't provided any clear information about his role or actions from the previous night, making it likely that he is trying to hide something. Given the information we have, voting for Lucian is the best way to identify if he is a Werewolf and help the village team win.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been deflecting questions and not providing any real insights, which is suspicious behavior. It seems like he's trying to avoid scrutiny, which could indicate he's a Werewolf. Voting for Viktor aligns with the goal of identifying and eliminating a potential Werewolf.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian has been evasive and quick to cast suspicion without providing any concrete information about his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with someone trying to deflect attention away from themselves, which makes me believe he could be a Werewolf.
> **Viktor [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Villager : 4
* Viktor : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** Lucian was killed. The werewolves win.
