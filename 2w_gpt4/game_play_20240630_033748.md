## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There are two werewolves in play, Vladimir and Cristina. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dragos. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Mircea. They are thinking about their action.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Examining two center cards allows me to gather information on roles that are not in play, which will help me verify any claims made by other players during the day phase. This increases my chances of identifying any false claims made by Werewolves or the Minion.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Starting with a general question about night actions will help gather information. If anyone claims to be the Seer or Masons, I can then find ways to cast doubt on them or shift suspicion.
> **Vladimir:** I'm curious, did anyone here take any actions during the night phase? We need to get a sense of who might have seen or done something significant.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Getting the Seer to reveal themselves could allow me to frame them or cast doubt on their claims. It also helps to distract from anyone suspecting me or Vladimir.
> **Cristina:** I would like to know if anyone here is willing to admit if they are a Seer and saw something important during the night. It could help us narrow down our suspicions.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina's request for the Seer to reveal themselves is interesting. If she's genuinely looking to help the village, that's a good sign, but if she's a Werewolf or Minion, she might be trying to fish for important roles to target.
> **Dragos:** Cristina, I'm curious why you're specifically asking for the Seer to reveal themselves. Are you trying to gather information for the village or do you have another motive?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By accusing Dragos, I can redirect any suspicion away from myself and potentially get someone else in the hot seat. It also helps sow confusion among the Villagers, making it harder for them to work together effectively.
> **Cristina:** I think it's important for us to figure out who might be trying to mislead us. Dragos, you seem a bit suspicious to me for questioning why I would ask about the Seer. If I were a Villager, I would find it beneficial to know what the Seer saw. So why are you trying to cast doubt on me?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian hasn’t contributed to the discussion yet, and it’s important to get input from everyone to piece together the night’s events and uncover any suspicious behavior.
> **Dragos:** Lucian, you’ve been awfully quiet. Do you have anything to share about last night’s events?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been quick to cast suspicion on Cristina for asking about the Seer, which seems like a genuine attempt to gather information for the village. This defensiveness could be a sign that Dragos is trying to mislead us.
> **Lucian:** Alright, if no one wants to step forward as the Seer, I think we need to focus on what we've heard so far. Dragos, you seem very defensive when Cristina asked about the Seer. Why are you so quick to turn the suspicion back on her? It makes me wonder if you're trying to hide something.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir initiated the questioning but hasn't contributed his own information yet. It's important to gather details from everyone, and since Vladimir started the discussion, he might have something valuable to share.
> **Dragos:** Vladimir, you asked if anyone took any actions during the night phase, which seems like a good question to get us started. But you haven't shared anything yourself. Did you take any actions or see anything notable during the night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Dragos, I can shift the focus away from myself and Cristina, my Werewolf partner. Dragos's defensiveness can be framed as Minion behavior, which helps mislead the Villagers and protect the Werewolf team.
> **Vladimir:** Dragos, it's interesting how you're deflecting suspicion back onto Cristina. It feels like you're trying to muddy the waters here. Are you hiding something? Maybe you're the Minion trying to protect the real Werewolves.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina's eagerness to find the Seer could be a cover for deeper motives, and Vladimir's hesitation to share his own information after initiating the questioning is suspicious. We need to uncover their intentions to determine if they might be Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Dragos:** Cristina and Vladimir, you both seem a bit defensive when questioned. Cristina, why are you so eager to find the Seer? And Vladimir, you started the questioning but haven't shared anything yourself. Are you both trying to hide something?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos did bring up a good point about Vladimir starting the questioning but not sharing anything himself. We need to hear from Vladimir to get more information and see if his responses can help us identify any inconsistencies.
> **Lucian:** Vladimir, you haven't shared anything yourself. Did you take any actions or see anything notable during the night?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager and providing a reason for my initial question, I can appear more trustworthy. Directing suspicion towards Dragos, who has already been defensive, helps shift the focus away from myself and Cristina. This strategy keeps the heat off the Werewolves and maintains the narrative that we're just trying to uncover the truth.
> **Vladimir:** Lucian, you're right, it's time I shared something. I didn't take any actions during the night phase because I am a simple Villager. I just wanted to start the conversation to see what roles might be out there and to get everyone talking. But so far, we have Dragos being very defensive and Cristina pushing for the Seer to reveal themselves. This feels a bit off to me. I think we need to focus on those who are deflecting and pushing too hard for information.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina's eagerness could be an attempt to expose the Seer for the Werewolves' advantage, and Vladimir's deflection indicates he might be hiding something. We should be cautious and redirect our suspicion towards them to uncover the truth.
> **Dragos:** Let's consider what we have so far. Cristina, you're pushing hard for the Seer to reveal themselves, which seems overly eager. Vladimir, you asked a good question initially but have been deflecting ever since. Both of you seem to be trying to manipulate the conversation. I think one of you might be a Werewolf or the Minion. We need to focus on finding the real threat.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the roles in the center, I can verify anyone falsely claiming to be a Mason or Minion. Dragos's defensive behavior and accusations make him seem suspicious, so I want to hear his explanation.
> **Mircea:** I find it interesting that no one has stepped forward as the Seer, so I'll take the first step. During the night, I looked at two of the center cards and saw the Mason and Minion cards. This means that anyone claiming to be a Mason or Minion is lying. We should focus on those who seem suspicious. Dragos, you've been very defensive and quick to accuse others. What's your role?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea's delayed revelation about seeing the Mason and Minion cards in the center raises questions about his intentions. By confirming the Mason card but questioning his timing, we might uncover inconsistencies or hidden motives.
> **Dragos:** Mircea, your claim about seeing the Mason and Minion cards in the center is very interesting. Since I already know there is a Mason card in the center, I can confirm that part of your story. But I'm curious why you didn't mention this earlier, especially when Cristina was pushing for the Seer to reveal themselves. Why did you hold back this crucial information until now?


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** You've been defensive and quick to accuse others without giving a clear explanation for your actions. It's time you come clean about your role.
> **Mircea:** Dragos, you're deflecting way too much and pointing fingers at multiple people without providing any solid information. This behavior is highly suspicious. I think you might be a Werewolf trying to throw us off.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea's late revelation about the Mason and Minion cards in the center, despite knowing it from the start, is highly suspicious. By questioning him, we might uncover inconsistencies or hidden motives, revealing if he's trying to mislead us.
> **Dragos:** Mircea, your timing is highly suspicious. Why did you wait so long to reveal that you saw the Mason and Minion cards in the center? It feels like you're trying to manipulate the conversation to make others look guilty.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** By calling out Dragos's suspicious behavior, I can draw attention to his actions and potentially reveal his true role. My goal is to make other players scrutinize his behavior more closely.
> **Mircea:** I noticed that Dragos has been extremely defensive and quick to accuse others without providing any solid information. This kind of behavior is highly suspicious.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Mircea's late reveal, I can cast doubt on their credibility and shift suspicion away from myself and Cristina. It also keeps the conversation focused on Mircea, who might be a threat to the Werewolves if they are trusted.
> **Vladimir:** Mircea, your timing and sudden claim about seeing the Mason and Minion cards in the center is very convenient. It feels like you're trying to shift the focus away from anyone else who might be suspicious. Why didn't you mention this crucial information earlier when Cristina was asking about the Seer?


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir's hesitation and cautious approach raise suspicion. By questioning him directly, I can gauge his response and see if it aligns with his claim of being a Villager, or if it reveals inconsistencies that point to him being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Mircea:** Vladimir, you mentioned you're a Villager and wanted to get the conversation started, but why were you so hesitant to share anything initially? It feels like you were waiting to see where the suspicion would fall before stepping in. Can you explain your cautious approach?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Cristina directly, I can cast doubt on her intentions and shift the focus away from myself. This helps protect our Werewolf team and makes it seem like I'm genuinely trying to uncover the truth.
> **Vladimir:** Cristina, you've been very vocal about wanting to know who the Seer is, and you're pushing a lot of attention onto Dragos. Isn't it convenient that Mircea's claim about the center cards supports that there are no Masons to back up anyone else's claims? It feels like you're trying to manipulate the situation to divert suspicion from yourself. Can you explain why you're so eager to find out who the Seer is?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dragos has been extremely defensive and quick to accuse others without providing solid information. His behavior is highly suspicious and it aligns with someone who might be the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves. By voting for Dragos, we can shift the suspicion away from myself and Cristina and maintain our chances of winning as Werewolves.
> **Vladimir [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dragos has been very defensive and quick to accuse others without providing solid information. This behavior is highly suspicious, and it aligns with what Mircea has pointed out. By voting for Dragos, I can help divert attention from myself and Vladimir, increasing our chances of victory as the Werewolves.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea's late claim about seeing the Mason and Minion cards in the center is highly suspicious. Given that I know the Mason card is in the center, his story partially checks out but his timing is suspect. He might be trying to manipulate the conversation to divert suspicion away from himself. Voting for Mircea seems like the best option to uncover the truth and focus on a player exhibiting suspicious behavior.
> **Dragos [Mason]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been extremely defensive and quick to accuse others without providing solid information. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with how a Werewolf or Minion might act to deflect attention from themselves.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Throughout the discussion, Dragos has been extremely defensive and quick to accuse multiple players without providing solid information. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of someone trying to deflect attention away from themselves. Given that I revealed the Mason and Minion cards were in the center, anyone claiming those roles is lying, and Dragos's actions have not aligned with those of a genuine Villager or another trustworthy role.
> **Mircea [Seer]:** I am voting for Dragos.


The votes were:
* Dragos : Mason : 4
* Mircea : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Dragos was killed. The werewolves win.
