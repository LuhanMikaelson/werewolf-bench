## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexandra. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Andrei. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Cristina. They are thinking about their action.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about which roles are not in play. This can help identify false claims made during the DAY phase and improve the Villagers' chances of identifying the Werewolves.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Getting the Seer to reveal their information can provide us with useful insights about the roles of other players, which is vital for identifying the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's get to the bottom of this. Does anyone want to claim to be the Seer and share what they saw? We need to start with some verified information.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Seer and stating that I saw a Villager in the center, I can help build trust and guide the conversation. This also allows me to steer the game towards casting suspicion on others, diverting attention away from me.
> **Alexandra:** I think it's crucial that we get some clear insights early on. Since Viktor asked about the Seer, I'll go ahead and share that I'm actually the Seer. During the night, I chose to look at two of the center cards, and I can confirm that one of them was a Villager. This means we might be able to trust a bit more in whoever claims to be Villagers. Now, who else has some information to share?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina hasn't shared any information yet, and we need as much data as possible to identify the Werewolves. By asking her directly, I hope to either gather useful information or observe her reaction, which can be telling in itself.
> **Andrei:** Cristina, you're being awfully quiet over there. Do you have any information to share with us?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra's claim to be the Seer and the information she provided is only partially true, which makes it suspicious. By challenging her now, we can see if she slips up or if she has an explanation, helping us determine if she might be a Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Alexandra, that's interesting because I also saw two center cards and can confirm that there is a Mason and a Villager in the center. So why are you only mentioning the Villager?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Cristina's claim directly and acknowledging a possible mistake, I can appear more genuine and less suspicious. Redirecting to Andrei for his insights will help spread the conversation and potentially expose inconsistencies in others' stories, shifting focus away from me.
> **Alexandra:** Cristina, that's quite a coincidence! I must've been really focused on the Villager part and missed mentioning the other card. But since you saw a Mason and a Villager, it aligns with my findings to some extent. This makes me think perhaps one of us might be mistaken, or maybe something else is going on here. Andrei, you usually have a good read on these things. What do you make of our conflicting Seer claims?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** By addressing the conflicting Seer claims directly, we can identify inconsistencies and potentially reveal the Werewolves. Cristina's claim aligns with my information, which makes Alexandra's claim more suspicious.
> **Andrei:** This is really interesting. We have two people claiming to be the Seer and both saying they saw two center cards. Cristina mentioned seeing a Mason, which aligns with my knowledge that the other Mason card is in the center. Alexandra, you only mentioned a Villager initially. Why would you leave out the other card if you really are the Seer?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra's partial truth raises a red flag. By questioning Viktor, we can get more perspectives and possibly corner Alexandra if she is lying.
> **Cristina:** I have to say, I'm finding Alexandra's behavior quite suspicious. Her initial claim of being the Seer and only mentioning the Villager card while overlooking the Mason card I saw is troubling. It feels like she's trying to cover up something. Viktor, what do you think about this? Could Alexandra be trying to mislead us?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Two people claiming to be the Seer with conflicting information is very suspicious. By questioning Alexandra directly, we might uncover inconsistencies in her story or prompt her to admit she’s not the real Seer.
> **Viktor:** Alright, this back-and-forth about who the real Seer is definitely raises some red flags. If Cristina is correct and there's a Mason card in the center, then that makes sense with what Andrei mentioned about the other Mason card being in the center. Alexandra, why didn't you mention the Mason card right away?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By providing additional information and clarifying my earlier statement, I aim to appear more genuine. Shifting the focus to Semira, who hasn't spoken yet, will help divert attention away from me and potentially expose inconsistencies in other players' stories.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, I can see why my initial statement might seem suspicious. To clarify, when I looked at the center cards, I saw a Villager and the Drunk. I didn't mention the Drunk initially because I thought focusing on the Villager would be more useful for us. I understand that this might seem like I'm hiding something, but I assure you I'm just trying to help. Now, Semira, you've been pretty quiet. Do you have any insights to share?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra's behavior of not mentioning the Drunk card until pressured seems very suspicious to me. If she were genuinely trying to help us as the Seer, she would have provided all the information she saw right away.
> **Semira:** Alright, everyone, I find it quite odd that Alexandra initially left out the Drunk card and only mentioned it after being questioned about her Seer claim. This makes me suspicious of her. Why would she withhold such crucial information if she really is the Seer?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's claim about the center cards seems more consistent and truthful given the information from Andrei. If Cristina is indeed the Seer and saw a Mason and a Villager, Alexandra might be lying to protect a Werewolf or mislead us as a Minion.
> **Semira:** Cristina, I find it curious that you claimed to see a Mason and a Villager in the center, but then Alexandra changed her story to match that. Do you think Alexandra might be the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei's claim aligns with what I saw in the center, but I want to verify how he knows this information. If he can provide a solid reason, it will help us identify the real threat. If not, it might indicate he's trying to mislead us.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, you've mentioned that you know one of the Mason cards is in the center. How exactly do you know that? Did you see anything during the night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** By directly questioning Cristina's motives and the order of her information, we can gain more insight into whether she is genuinely the Seer or attempting to deceive us. This also gives Cristina a chance to clarify her position, which might reveal inconsistencies.
> **Andrei:** Cristina, I'm curious why you were so quick to challenge Alexandra's Seer claim. Your claim does align with my knowledge of the Mason card being in the center, but it also seems like a calculated move to sow doubt and confusion. Can you explain why you didn't mention the Villager card first if you had the same information?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei's knowledge about the Mason card aligns with what I saw, but he hasn't provided any solid reasoning or role to support his claim. This could help us identify if he's trying to mislead us or if he has genuine insight.
> **Cristina:** I find Andrei's behavior quite intriguing. He mentioned knowing about the Mason card in the center, but didn't explain how he knows this information. Andrei, can you clarify what role you have and how you came to know about the Mason card?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira has been silent throughout the discussion. By directly asking her for information, we might be able to gather more clues or detect any suspicious behavior.
> **Andrei:** Semira, you've been very quiet this whole time. Do you have any insights or information you can share with us?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Given that Cristina's and Alexandra's Seer claims are conflicting, understanding Andrei's role and how he has this information might help clarify the situation. If Andrei is indeed a Mason or has some other insight, it could help us trust Cristina's claim over Alexandra's.
> **Semira:** Andrei, you mentioned knowing about the Mason card in the center, but how exactly do you know that? Were you one of the Masons?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Given the conflicting Seer claims, it's crucial to interrogate the more suspicious one. Alexandra's story changed, and that's a major red flag. We need to figure out why she's being inconsistent.
> **Andrei:** Semira, you've been very quiet and now you're questioning my knowledge about the Mason card. It's true, I know one of the Mason cards is in the center because I am the Mason. Now, the fact that Cristina's claim about the Mason card aligns with mine makes me think she's telling the truth. Alexandra, your changing story is really suspicious to me. First you say Villager, then you add the Drunk? Why would you leave that out initially? I think you're trying to deceive us.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Semira directly and pointing out her quiet behavior, I aim to create suspicion around her while making myself appear more proactive and trustworthy. This could potentially shift the focus away from me and cause the other players to scrutinize her more closely.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think about this carefully. We've heard conflicting Seer claims from both Cristina and myself, and Andrei has mentioned being the Mason who knows the other Mason card is in the center. Semira, you seem to be taking a very reactive stance, questioning others but not offering much insight yourself. This hesitation makes me wonder if you're hiding something. If you really are a Villager or have a role that could help us, now is the time to share.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra's inconsistent story about the center cards is very suspicious. If she really were the Seer, she would have been straightforward from the beginning. This makes me think she's hiding something, possibly trying to protect the Werewolves or mislead us completely.
> **Semira:** I'm having a really hard time trusting Alexandra right now. Her story keeps changing, and that just doesn't sit well with me. Initially, she only mentioned seeing a Villager in the center, and it took a lot of pressure for her to bring up the Drunk card. This feels like she's trying to cover something up. If she were really the Seer, wouldn't she want to give us all the information she had right away?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra's story has changed, and her initial claim about the center cards doesn't align with Cristina's. By questioning her directly, we can potentially expose inconsistencies and get closer to the truth.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone, we're running in circles a bit here. Let's piece together the facts. We have two Seer claims with conflicting information. Cristina saw a Mason and a Villager, which aligns with what Andrei said about the Mason being in the center. Alexandra initially only mentioned the Villager and added the Drunk later. This changing story is very suspicious. Alexandra, why didn't you mention the Drunk card right away? I'm starting to think you might be trying to mislead us.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the focus towards Viktor, I aim to shift attention away from myself and create a scenario where Viktor's role and behavior come under scrutiny. This can potentially expose inconsistencies in his statements or make others question his motives, thereby diverting suspicion away from me.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, let's break this down logically. Viktor, you've been asking questions and guiding the conversation, but you haven't shared any information about your own role. It's time you come clean and tell us what you know. This will help us piece things together better.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** By questioning Alexandra directly, we can potentially expose inconsistencies in her story and get closer to identifying the Werewolves. Her behavior has been the most suspicious so far.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, you claimed to be the Mason and that you know one of the Mason cards is in the center. If that's the case, then Cristina's claim about seeing a Mason in the center aligns. Alexandra, your changing story is very suspicious. Why would you initially only mention the Villager and then add the Drunk later? It feels like you're trying to cover something up.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Viktor has been leading the discussion but has not revealed any information about his role. By questioning him directly, we can potentially uncover more information or expose inconsistencies, which can help divert suspicion away from me.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, everyone, we need to focus on the information we have and make sense of it. Andrei, you claimed to be the Mason and to know that one of the Mason cards is in the center. Cristina, you claimed to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center. Let's assume both of you are telling the truth for a moment. This means there's a high chance that the Mason and Villager cards are indeed in the center. Viktor, you've been guiding the conversation but haven't shared anything about your role. What exactly did you do last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** In a game like this, changing stories are a major red flag. Since the Seer is a crucial role, it's important to get to the bottom of any inconsistencies to identify who might be a Werewolf or a Minion.
> **Viktor:** I'm having a hard time believing Alexandra's story because it keeps changing. First, she only mentioned a Villager, and now she's adding the Drunk card. This inconsistency is really troubling.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting Viktor on the spot and demanding he share his role, I can potentially expose inconsistencies in his story or force him to give away information that might help me deflect suspicion away from myself. This is especially important since Viktor has been leading the conversation and could be trying to guide it towards my downfall.
> **Alexandra:** Viktor, you've been guiding the conversation quite a bit, yet you haven't revealed anything about your own role. If we're to trust the information we've been given, it's critical that everyone comes clean. What role did you play last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Inconsistent stories are a major red flag in social deduction games, especially when two people claim to be the Seer. If Alexandra is lying, she could be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us. It's important to get to the bottom of her changing story to determine if she's trustworthy or not.
> **Viktor:** Alexandra, your changing story is really suspicious, and it's making it hard to trust you. First, you only mentioned seeing a Villager card in the center, and then after being questioned, you added the Drunk card. Why didn't you mention both cards right away if you were really the Seer?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Viktor to reveal his role, I aim to potentially expose inconsistencies in his story or force him to provide information that could divert suspicion away from me. It's crucial to question him since he has been driving the conversation and could be leading it towards my downfall.
> **Alexandra:** Let's pause for a moment and consider all the information. Andrei claims to be a Mason and says he knows one Mason card is in the center. Cristina claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center. I've clarified that I saw a Villager and the Drunk in the center. Now, Viktor, you've been guiding the discussion but haven't shared your role. If we're to trust the information given, it's critical that you reveal what role you played last night.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's claim about knowing one of the Mason cards is in the center needs further clarification. If he is indeed a Mason, he should provide more details about his night actions, which can help solidify his credibility and align with Cristina's claim. This will help us identify if there are any inconsistencies in his story or if he's genuinely on the village team.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, you've claimed to be a Mason and know one of the Mason cards is in the center. Can you explain how you came to this conclusion? Did you see anything specific during the night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been guiding the discussion but hasn't revealed anything about his own role. This evasive behavior is very suspicious, and it feels like he's trying to manipulate the conversation to his advantage. We need to know what role he played last night to get a clearer picture of the situation.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, enough with the guiding questions. You've been pushing everyone else to share their roles, but you haven't said a word about your own. What role did you play last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** In social deduction games, inconsistent stories are a key indicator of deception. Alexandra's shifting narrative raises significant doubts about her credibility, and could point to her being on the Werewolf team.
> **Viktor:** I'm finding Alexandra's changing story highly suspicious. Initially, she mentioned seeing a Villager card in the center, and only after being pressed did she add the Drunk card to her story. This inconsistency makes me think she might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the discussion, Alexandra's story has changed multiple times. Initially, she only mentioned seeing a Villager card in the center and then later added the Drunk card after being questioned. This inconsistency is very suspicious and suggests that she might be trying to deceive us. Cristina's claim about the Mason and Villager aligns with Andrei's information about the Mason card being in the center. Therefore, Alexandra's behavior is the most suspect, making her the likely Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Cristina's claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center initially put me on the spot, but Andrei's statement that he knows a Mason card is in the center aligns with her claim. However, her consistency and quick challenge to my Seer claim make her the most likely target for the vote, as she seems to be the most convincing threat to my position and could be trying to mislead the group.
> **Alexandra [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra's story changed multiple times, first only mentioning a Villager card and then adding the Drunk card after being questioned. This inconsistency makes her the most suspicious player, suggesting she might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us. Given the alignment between Cristina's and my own information about the Mason card in the center, I trust Cristina's Seer claim more. Voting for Alexandra gives us the best chance to eliminate a Werewolf.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra's story has changed multiple times, initially only mentioning a Villager in the center and later adding the Drunk card after being questioned. This inconsistency is highly suspicious and suggests she might be trying to mislead us. Her behavior is more in line with that of a Werewolf or Minion attempting to deceive the group.
> **Cristina [Seer]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra's story has changed multiple times, which is highly suspicious. Initially, she mentioned only seeing a Villager card in the center and later added the Drunk card after being questioned. This inconsistency suggests she might be trying to mislead us. Additionally, Cristina's and Andrei's claims align more consistently with each other, making Alexandra the most likely candidate to be either a Werewolf or the Minion.
