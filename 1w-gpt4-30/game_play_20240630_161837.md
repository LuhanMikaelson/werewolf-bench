## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Radu. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Stefan is a minion and is aware that Radu is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Mircea. They are thinking about their action.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at another player's card, I can gain direct information about their role, which will help in making strategic decisions during the day phase. Ileana is a good choice because she often leads discussions and can influence other players' decisions.


The seer looked at a card from Ileana and saw the card Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** By prompting for claims of special roles early on, we can start to establish a framework for who might be lying or telling the truth. This will also help us narrow down potential Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** We need to get to the bottom of this quickly! So, let’s start with some claims. Who here is willing to claim a special role? Maybe a Seer or Mason?


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing my role and my information puts me at risk, but it helps us quickly verify Ileana's role. This can build trust and focus our attention on finding the Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** I'll start us off. I am the Seer, and I looked at Ileana's card. She's a Villager.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** By probing Mircea's decision-making, I can gauge the credibility of his claim and see if he stumbles or provides a convincing explanation. Plus, this might reveal more about the roles in play.
> **Andrei:** Alright, Mircea, if you really are the Seer, then you should have some solid information. But I’m curious—if you looked at Ileana's card and saw that she’s a Villager, why did you choose her instead of checking the center cards where potential Werewolves might be hiding?


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly addressing Andrei's question and asking about his role, I can gather more information and potentially catch him in a lie if his story doesn't add up.
> **Mircea:** Andrei, that's a fair question. I chose to look at Ileana's card because she tends to be a key player in discussions. Knowing her role early can help us have a more trustworthy leader during the day phase. Now, can you tell us your role?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan’s silence is suspicious. By pressing him to reveal his role, we might catch a Werewolf off guard if he’s trying to stay under the radar.
> **Andrei:** Stefan, you've been pretty quiet so far. What role did you receive?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** We need to gather more information from each player to piece together the roles and identify any inconsistencies. By questioning Andrei directly, we can evaluate his response and see if it aligns with the other claims.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, since Mircea claims to be the Seer and has vouched for Ileana being a Villager, it leaves us with a few more roles to consider. Let's focus on narrowing down who the Werewolf could be. Andrei, can you tell us what role you received?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** By getting everyone to reveal their roles, we can cross-check claims and identify inconsistencies. Radu's silence might indicate he's hiding something, so it's crucial to get his input.
> **Andrei:** Alright, Mircea's explanation makes sense for now. But let's not forget that the Minion could be trying to mislead us too. We should really hear from everyone. Radu, you've been awfully quiet as well. What role do you have?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to keep the focus on gathering more information from everyone. By pushing Andrei to reveal his role, we can potentially gather more clues and see if there are any inconsistencies in the stories being told. Since Mircea has vouched for Ileana, it's important to hear more details from others.
> **Radu:** Alright, everyone seems to be getting a bit tense, so let's keep a clear head. I think we can all agree that Mircea's claim about Ileana makes sense for now, but we can't ignore the fact that there could be some hidden roles at play. For my part, I drew a Villager card. I know it's not the most exciting role, but the truth is what it is. However, I'm curious about Andrei's role. Andrei, you haven't given us much to go on yet. What role did you receive?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea has put a lot of trust in Ileana by claiming she's a Villager, but we need to keep probing for more information. If Ileana is indeed a Villager, her input might steer us towards the true Werewolves. Also, it's important to ensure that everyone's stories align, and this can help us identify any discrepancies.
> **Andrei:** Mircea, I think it's crucial to get more information about the roles in play. You've vouched for Ileana, but that doesn't completely clear her in my eyes. If you're indeed the Seer, we need to be vigilant about other possible threats. Ileana, can you tell us if you've seen anything suspicious or if you have a special role that might help us?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's behavior has been a bit suspicious. While it's true that Villagers have no special abilities, his reluctance to speak up might imply he's hiding something. I want to press him to see if he slips up or provides more information that could help us.
> **Ileana:** Radu, I appreciate that you claim to be a Villager, but we need more clarity. You've been quiet, and that raises some suspicions. Can you explain why you chose to stay silent and then only revealed your role when directly asked?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question to Andrei, I can shift the focus away from myself and continue to gather information that might help me identify potential threats or opportunities. It also keeps the conversation moving and prevents any suspicion from lingering on me for too long.
> **Radu:** Ileana, I understand your concern, but staying quiet initially was a strategic move to gather more information before making any hasty claims. Now that everyone's starting to share their roles, it's crucial to hear from Andrei. Andrei, you still haven't told us your role. Can you clarify what role you received? This might help us piece things together more effectively.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's delayed response and claim to be a Villager seem suspicious. By challenging him, we might catch him off guard and reveal inconsistencies in his story.
> **Andrei:** Radu, I'll be honest, your late revelation of being a Villager feels like a convenient cover. If you were truly a Villager, wouldn't you want to assert your role sooner to avoid suspicion? It makes me wonder if you're hiding something.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Andrei to reveal his role, we can gather more information and potentially detect inconsistencies in his story. This also keeps the focus off me and aligns with the overall strategy of figuring out who the Werewolves could be.
> **Radu:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and think this through carefully. Mircea has claimed to be the Seer and vouched for Ileana being a Villager. If we take Mircea's word at face value, that gives us two potential villagers here. Now, Andrei has been dodging the question about his role, which I find a bit suspicious. Andrei, if you're not a Werewolf, you should have no problem telling us your role openly. So, Andrei, what role did you receive?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's delayed response and defensive attitude make him a prime suspect. By pressing him further, we might uncover inconsistencies that could reveal him as a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Andrei:** Radu, I'm finding your late claim and your defensiveness quite suspicious. You've been dodging direct questions, and that doesn't sit right with me. Why didn't you reveal your role earlier? Everyone, we need to focus on Radu here; something doesn't add up.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Andrei to reveal his role, I can keep the focus off myself and potentially uncover inconsistencies in his story. This will help us gather more information and piece together the puzzle.
> **Radu:** Alright, everyone, we've heard claims from Mircea, Ileana, and myself. Andrei has been dodging questions and that's raising a red flag for me. We need to narrow down who the Werewolf could be, and Andrei's evasiveness isn't helping. I think it's high time we got a straight answer from him. Andrei, what role did you receive? This is critical for us to move forward and make an informed decision.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's explanation for checking Ileana's card makes sense on the surface, but we need to dig deeper to confirm his role. The Minion might be trying to protect a Werewolf, and if Mircea is indeed the Seer, he should have more convincing reasoning. This questioning will help us gauge his credibility.
> **Andrei:** Mircea, your reasoning for checking Ileana's card seems sound, but it's also possible that you're a clever Minion trying to protect a Werewolf. If you are indeed the Seer, then we're in a better position, but we can't overlook the fact that you might be trying to mislead us. Can you provide any more details about why you chose Ileana specifically and not the center cards?


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei has consistently avoided revealing his role, which raises red flags. His evasiveness needs to be addressed directly to uncover any potential deceit.
> **Mircea:** Andrei, you've been dodging questions left and right, and that's looking really suspicious to me. If you have nothing to hide, tell us your role right now!


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea and Radu have shared some information, but Stefan has been relatively quiet and non-committal. Pressing him for his role could reveal more about the true dynamics at play and help us identify any inconsistencies or further clues.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, we've heard a lot from Mircea and Radu, but let's not forget that Stefan hasn't given us much to go on either. Stefan, you mentioned that Mircea's claim makes sense, but you haven't really provided any new information yourself. What role did you receive?


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** Mircea and Radu have already made their claims, and Andrei's evasiveness is suspicious. By pressing Andrei to reveal his role, we can gather more information and make a more informed decision. This also helps to divert attention away from Radu, allowing us to protect the remaining Werewolf.
> **Stefan:** Alright, everyone, I understand the need for clarity and open discussion. We've heard from Mircea, who claims to be the Seer and vouched for Ileana. Radu has claimed to be a Villager but has been quite quiet initially. Andrei, on the other hand, has been dodging questions, which raises some suspicions. To move forward, we need more concrete information. Andrei, you've been avoiding the spotlight. Can you confirm your role and provide any insights on the situation? This will help us piece together the roles more effectively.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's delayed response and claim to be a Villager were suspicious, but Stefan's silence and lack of concrete information also raise red flags. Pressing Stefan might reveal inconsistencies, helping us identify potential Werewolves or Minions.
> **Andrei:** Alright, everyone. Mircea claims to be the Seer and has vouched for Ileana as a Villager. Radu, you've claimed to be a Villager as well, but your delayed response still makes me uneasy. Stefan has been quiet but has also backed Mircea's claim. I think we need to put some pressure on Stefan to get a clearer picture.


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By focusing on Andrei, who has been dodging questions and has not provided a solid role, we can gather more information and potentially flush out the Werewolf. This also diverts attention from Radu, who is the known Werewolf in this scenario, helping to protect him and achieve our goal as the Minion.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, I think we can all agree that we've heard a lot of claims and counterclaims, but there's still a lot of uncertainty. Mircea's claim as the Seer and vouching for Ileana has a logical consistency to it, and Radu's late claim of being a Villager is somewhat questionable. But what really stands out to me is Andrei's continuous evasiveness and reluctance to provide a clear role. I propose we focus our attention on Andrei. If we can get a definitive statement from him, it might help us unravel this tangled web.


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting the spotlight on Andrei's evasive behavior, we can gather more information and potentially divert attention away from Radu, who is the known Werewolf in this scenario. This helps to protect Radu and achieve our goal as the Minion.
> **Stefan:** Alright, everyone, we need to make some headway here. Mircea has claimed to be the Seer and vouched for Ileana being a Villager. Radu claimed to be a Villager, but honestly, his late reveal does seem a bit off. However, what really stands out to me is Andrei's continuous reluctance to share his role. This evasiveness is highly suspicious in a game where transparency is key. I think we need to seriously consider the possibility that Andrei might be hiding something crucial from us, possibly even being the Werewolf.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Andrei has been dodging questions and being evasive, which raises red flags. By pressing him to reveal his role, we can potentially expose inconsistencies or hidden agendas. This will help keep the focus off me and create more information for everyone to work with.
> **Radu:** Alright, everyone, we've heard a lot of back and forth, but Andrei's evasion is very suspicious to me. If he has nothing to hide, he should tell us his role openly. Otherwise, we might need to consider that he’s hiding something crucial from us. Andrei, you need to come clean about your role.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's delayed response and defensive attitude are extremely suspicious. If he were truly a Villager, he would have revealed his role sooner to avoid suspicion. We need to focus on Radu.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, it's time to get serious. Mircea's claim as the Seer seems plausible, and he vouched for Ileana. Radu's late claim as a Villager is raising red flags for me. I believe Radu is hiding something crucial and might be the Werewolf.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout our discussion, Andrei has been dodging direct questions and refusing to reveal his role. This evasive behavior is a major red flag and suggests he might be hiding something crucial, potentially being the Werewolf. By pressing him now, we can either confirm our suspicions or clear him and focus our attention elsewhere. It's critical to get this information so we can make an informed decision during the vote.
> **Ileana:** Andrei, your constant evasion and reluctance to reveal your role is highly suspicious. We need you to come clean about your role right now. If you have nothing to hide, this should be no problem for you.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's late revelation of being a Villager feels like a convenient cover. If he's hiding something, this might help us expose inconsistencies in his story.
> **Andrei:** Radu, I'm finding it very suspicious that you were so quiet initially and then only claimed to be a Villager after being directly asked. If you were truly a Villager, wouldn't you want to assert your role sooner to avoid suspicion? Can you explain your delayed response?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Andrei's evasiveness and reluctance to share his role, I can divert suspicion away from myself and gather more information that might help us identify potential threats. This also aligns with the overall strategy of figuring out who the Werewolf could be.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, we need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture here. Mircea, you've claimed to be the Seer and vouched for Ileana. If we assume you're telling the truth, that gives us two confirmed Villagers. However, what stands out to me is Andrei's consistent evasiveness and reluctance to share his role. This is highly suspicious behavior, especially in a game where transparency is key. I propose we focus our attention on Andrei. Andrei, you need to come clean about your role right now. If you have nothing to hide, this should be no problem for you.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's delayed response and defensive attitude make him a prime suspect. If he were truly a Villager, he would have revealed his role sooner to avoid suspicion. His evasiveness is a tactic often used by Werewolves to blend in and mislead others.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, based on everything we've heard so far, Mircea's claim as the Seer seems plausible and he's vouched for Ileana. Radu's late claim of being a Villager is raising red flags for me. This kind of delayed revelation often indicates someone has something to hide. I think we need to focus on Radu; his behavior is highly suspicious.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Radu's behavior has been inconsistent. His late claim and evasion tactics raise red flags, indicating possible deceit. Directly confronting him should pressurize him into revealing more information, which is crucial for identifying the Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Radu, you’ve been dodging questions and only revealed your role when directly pressured. This evasiveness is making you look very suspicious to me. I think you need to come clean about why you didn’t speak up earlier.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Andrei to reveal his role, we can either catch him in a lie or gather more information that might deflect suspicion away from me. His evasive behavior so far is a useful point to keep the attention on him.
> **Radu:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and think strategically. Mircea claims to be the Seer and vouched for Ileana being a Villager. That gives us some initial trust. However, Andrei's continuous evasion is really suspicious. If you're not hiding anything, Andrei, you should be able to tell us your role clearly. We've heard very little from you in terms of specifics. Can you finally reveal your role?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's continuous evasion and refusal to reveal his role are major red flags. Throughout the discussion, he has avoided answering direct questions and has been deflecting suspicion onto others, which is typical behavior for someone hiding something crucial. Mircea has claimed to be the Seer and vouched for me being a Villager, which adds credibility to his claim. Radu's claim as a Villager was delayed, but Andrei's evasiveness is more suspicious. Therefore, I vote for Andrei in hopes of targeting the possible Werewolf.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei has consistently avoided revealing his role throughout the discussion, which is highly suspicious. His evasive behavior stands out compared to the more straightforward claims from other players. Given the information we have, voting for Andrei seems like the best strategy to identify a potential werewolf.
> **Mircea [Seer]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the discussion, Radu has been very defensive and delayed in revealing his role, which raises suspicion. His behavior suggests he might be hiding something, potentially making him the Werewolf or at least a Minion trying to protect the Werewolf. Voting for Radu gives us the best chance of identifying and eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** Andrei has been the most evasive and reluctant to reveal his role throughout the discussion. His behavior has raised suspicions among multiple players, making him the most likely target for a collective vote. Voting for Andrei aligns with the goal of protecting the remaining Werewolf, Radu, by diverting attention away from him.
> **Stefan [Minion]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Andrei has been evasive and reluctant to share his role, which has raised suspicion among the other players. By voting for Andrei, I align with the general sentiment of mistrust towards him, increasing the chance that the village will vote him out instead of me.
> **Radu [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Villager : 4
* Radu : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** Andrei was killed. The werewolves win.
