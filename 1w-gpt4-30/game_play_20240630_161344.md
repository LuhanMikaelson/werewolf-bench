## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Larisa. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Ileana. They are thinking about their action.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards helps me understand which roles are not in play. This information can be valuable for verifying claims made by other players during the day phase. If I find a Werewolf card in the center, it means there is only one (or none) among the players, and if I find any other special roles, I can deduce who might be lying about their identity.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible to identify the Werewolves. By sharing what roles we have seen or what actions we took, we can start to piece together the puzzle.
> **Lucian:** Hey everyone, I think it's important we start sharing what we know. Has anyone checked any of the center cards or other players' cards during the night phase?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information to start identifying the Werewolves. Knowing what the Seer or any other role has discovered can help us figure out if anyone is lying about their role.
> **Marius:** I think the best way for us to proceed is to hear if anyone has checked a center card or another player's card. This will give us some clarity on what roles are in play and help us narrow down our suspicions.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible to identify the Werewolves. Knowing who took night actions and what they saw will help us piece together the puzzle.
> **Alexia:** I think it's important we all share if we took any night actions. Did anyone see or switch any cards?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing this information, I can eliminate confusion and false claims about the Mason and Minion roles. This narrows down the possible roles each of us could have and helps us identify any lies being told.
> **Ileana:** I think it's crucial to share some concrete information now. During the night phase, I saw the Mason and Minion cards in the center, which means neither of those roles are in play.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Ileana's claim and asking for confirmation, I aim to create doubt and confusion among the other players. This will divert attention away from me and make it harder for them to piece together the true roles.
> **Larisa:** I think it's really interesting that Ileana claims to have seen both the Mason and Minion cards in the center. If this is true, it means we don’t have those roles in play. But then, who are the Masons? Can anyone else confirm or deny that they saw the Mason cards or the Minion card?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim significantly impacts our understanding of the roles in play. If her information is accurate, it narrows down our suspicions. However, we need to ensure she's telling the truth and not trying to mislead us.
> **Lucian:** Ileana, your claim about seeing the Mason and Minion cards in the center is quite specific. Can you explain why you decided to look at two center cards instead of one player's card?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's questioning of my decision to look at two center cards might be an attempt to shift focus away from himself. By putting him on the spot, I can gauge his reaction and see if he might be hiding something.
> **Ileana:** Lucian, why are you so interested in why I chose to look at two center cards instead of one player's card? Are you trying to divert attention from something?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim is quite specific and could be a crucial piece of information, but we need more players to corroborate this before we can fully trust it.
> **Lucian:** I'm still not sure if Ileana's claim about the Mason and Minion cards in the center is trustworthy. Can anyone else confirm that they saw any specific roles in the center? We need more verification to make an informed decision.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center seems too convenient and might be a deceptive move. Pressing her for more details can help reveal inconsistencies in her story.
> **Marius:** Ileana, I find your claim interesting, but I'm having a hard time believing that both the Mason and Minion cards are in the center. There's a high chance you might be one of the Werewolves or even the Minion trying to confuse us. Can you explain why you chose to look at two center cards and not one player's card?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius's skepticism could be a diversion tactic, and I need to understand if he has any real information or if he's trying to mislead us. By questioning him, I can gauge his response and see if he's hiding something.
> **Ileana:** Marius, you seem very skeptical of my claim about the Mason and Minion cards being in the center. Why are you so certain that they might not be there? Do you have any other information that contradicts my statement?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's persistent questioning of Ileana's choice to look at two center cards instead of one player's card seems like an attempt to shift focus. If he has any additional information, it could either validate or invalidate Ileana's claim and help us narrow down the suspects. This might also reveal if Lucian is trying to mislead us or if he's genuinely trying to gather more information.
> **Marius:** Lucian, you seem very interested in Ileana's claim and her reasoning behind looking at two center cards. Why are you so focused on this? Do you have any information that can either support or contradict what she's saying?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been vocal about doubting Ileana's claim. Pressing him for more information might reveal if he has any ulterior motives or if he's genuinely trying to uncover the truth.
> **Lucian:** Marius, your skepticism towards Ileana is interesting. Do you have any information or insights that might contradict what Ileana is saying? Have you seen any roles or cards during the night phase?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to press Ileana for more details to see if there are any inconsistencies in her story. Her claim could be a deceptive move, and getting more information will help us determine if she's telling the truth or if she's trying to mislead us.
> **Marius:** Ileana, your claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center is quite specific. Can you tell us more about why you chose to look at two center cards instead of one player's card?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexia's silence is suspicious. By directly questioning her, I can assess her reaction and gather more information about her possible role. If she's hesitant or gives an unclear answer, it could indicate she has something to hide.
> **Ileana:** Alexia, you've been awfully quiet compared to Marius and Lucian. Did you happen to see or do anything during the night phase?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to verify Ileana's claim and understand her reasoning. If she's truthful, it gives us clarity on which roles are in play. If she's lying, it could indicate she's a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Alexia:** Ileana, your claim about the Mason and Minion cards being in the center seems quite specific. If that's true, it helps narrow down the roles. But could you explain why you decided to look at two center cards instead of one player's card? It would help us understand your thought process.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexia's silence is suspicious. By directly questioning her, I can assess her reaction and gather more information about her possible role. If she's hesitant or gives an unclear answer, it could indicate she has something to hide.
> **Ileana:** Alexia, you've been awfully quiet compared to Marius and Lucian. Did you happen to see or do anything during the night phase?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center is significant, but we need more information from other players to corroborate or refute her statement. Marius has been very vocal, so getting him to share his night's actions or observations might provide more clarity.
> **Alexia:** Marius, you've been very quick to question Ileana about her reasoning, but you haven't shared any information about what you did or saw during the night phase. If you have any information that can help us, now would be the time to share it.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim could be a strategic move to mislead us. By directing the conversation towards confirming or contradicting her claim, we can either validate her information or expose inconsistencies. This will help us better identify potential Werewolves.
> **Marius:** I think it's clear that Ileana's claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center is quite convenient. If that's true, then we need to identify who the Werewolves could be. Does anyone else have any information that can either support or contradict Ileana's claim? Specifically, did anyone else see any roles in the center?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been very vocal and questioning Ileana, but hasn't shared any of his own information yet. Getting him to reveal his actions or observations during the night phase might provide more clarity and help us verify or refute Ileana's claim.
> **Alexia:** Ileana, your claim about the Mason and Minion cards being in the center is quite specific and crucial. However, we need to verify it. Marius, you've been very vocal and skeptical. Can you share what you did during the night phase? Any information you have might help us piece this puzzle together.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center is very specific and seems like it could be a strategic move to deceive us. If we press her for more details and find inconsistencies, it might reveal her true role. Additionally, if Lucian is pressing her too hard, it could be a sign of an attempt to shift focus away from himself.
> **Marius:** I find it hard to believe Ileana's claim about seeing both the Mason and the Minion in the center. That seems too convenient and makes me think she might be trying to mislead us. We need to consider the possibility that Ileana might be a Werewolf or the Minion.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius has been very vocal and skeptical about my claim, which makes me suspicious of his intentions. By putting him on the spot, I can gauge his response and see if he might be hiding something.
> **Ileana:** Marius, you seem to be casting a lot of doubt on my claim. If you have any information or insights from the night phase, now would be the perfect time to share it with us.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center is very specific and could be a strategic move to deceive us. If we press her for more details and find inconsistencies, it might reveal her true role. Additionally, if Lucian is pressing her too hard, it could be a sign of an attempt to shift focus away from himself.
> **Marius:** Ileana, I'm having a hard time believing your claim about seeing both the Mason and the Minion cards in the center. That seems too convenient and makes me think you might be trying to mislead us. Can you tell us more about why you chose to look at two center cards instead of one player's card?


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius's continuous skepticism without providing any concrete information of his own is highly suspicious. By pressing him to share his actions or observations, we can better evaluate his intentions and whether he's trying to mislead us.
> **Ileana:** Marius, you've been very vocal about doubting my claim, but you still haven't shared anything about your own actions or observations from the night phase. Tell us what you did or saw during the night.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center is too convenient and seems suspicious. We need more information from other players, and Alexia has been too passive, which could indicate she's hiding something.
> **Marius:** Alexia, you’ve been very quiet and only asking questions. Have you seen or done anything during the night phase that can help us verify Ileana’s claims?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been asking a lot of questions and casting doubt on Ileana's claim, but hasn't provided any information about his own actions. It's crucial to get him to share what he did or saw during the night phase to either support or refute Ileana's statement.
> **Alexia:** Marius, you've been very vocal in doubting Ileana's claim, but you still haven't shared anything about your own actions or observations from the night phase. Tell us what you did or saw during the night.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Alexia has been relatively passive, it's important to see if she has any information that could either support or contradict Ileana's specific claim about the Mason and Minion cards being in the center. Gathering more information from quieter players can help us figure out if someone is hiding something.
> **Marius:** Alexia, you've been very quiet compared to the rest of us. Did you see or do anything during the night phase that can help us verify Ileana's claims?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been casting a lot of doubt on Ileana without providing any concrete information of his own. It's important to get him to share his night's actions to either support or refute Ileana's claim and help us identify the Werewolves.

> **Marius:** Ileana, I find your claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center very suspicious. That seems too convenient. Why did you choose to look at two center cards instead of one player's card?

> **Ileana:** Marius, you've been very vocal about doubting my claim, but you still haven't shared anything about your own actions or observations from the night phase. Tell us what you did or saw during the night.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's specific claim about the Mason and Minion cards in the center seems too calculated and could be a deceptive move. Pressing her for more details might reveal inconsistencies in her story, which would help identify her true role.
> **Marius:** I think Ileana might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us. Her claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center seems too convenient.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana claimed to have seen both the Mason and Minion cards in the center, which is a very specific claim. However, no other player has confirmed seeing those cards, and several players, including Marius, have expressed doubt about her claim. This makes her the most suspicious player to me. Voting for Ileana gives us the best chance to eliminate a potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center seems very specific and suspicious. It feels like a calculated move to mislead us. Throughout the day phase, she has also been deflecting questions and focusing on others’ actions instead of providing a solid reasoning for her own. This makes me think she might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to confuse the village team.
> **Marius [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion cards in the center seems too convenient and specific. No one else has corroborated her statement, and her choice to look at two center cards instead of one player's card is suspicious. Marius has been very vocal about doubting Ileana's claim, and this skepticism aligns with my own. Voting for Ileana seems like the best option to eliminate a potential Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Alexia [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius has been overly skeptical of my claim without providing any concrete information of his own. His constant questioning and focus on doubting my actions suggest he might be trying to divert attention away from himself and could be hiding something. This behavior is consistent with that of a Werewolf or Minion trying to sow confusion.
> **Ileana [Seer]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana's claim that both the Mason and Minion cards are in the center seems very specific and convenient, and it has drawn a lot of skepticism from other players like Marius. This doubt surrounding her claim makes her the most likely target for the village to vote out, increasing my chances of survival as the sole Werewolf.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


The votes were:
* Marius : Villager : 1
* Ileana : Seer : 4



>***GAME:*** Ileana was killed. The werewolves win.
