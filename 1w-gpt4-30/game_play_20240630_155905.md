## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Selene. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Alexia. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Lucian. They are thinking about their action.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards allows me to gather information without revealing too much about any specific player early on. This helps me better understand the roles in play and strategize accordingly.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Masons are trustworthy villagers and can confirm each other. If they reveal themselves, we can focus on finding the Werewolves without wasting time on clearing innocent villagers.
> **Dracula:** I think it's important for us to hear from the Masons first. If they can confirm each other, that will help us narrow down suspects quickly.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** This information confirms that we don't have a Minion and one Mason card is out of play. This can help narrow down the roles and give us a clearer picture of who might be the Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** I looked at two of the center cards and saw the Minion and one of the Masons there.


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I know that I am the sole Mason, confirming the exact details of what Lucian saw can help verify his claim and narrow down the roles of the other players.
> **Alexia:** Lucian, if you saw the Minion and a Mason in the center, that means the other Mason is definitely in the middle. Can you elaborate on what you saw and what order they were in?


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Dracula was the first to bring up the Masons, I want to see if he has any actual information or if he is trying to manipulate the conversation. This will help us understand his motive and potentially identify if he's on the Werewolf team.
> **Lucian:** Dracula, you asked for the Masons to speak up first. Are you claiming to be a Mason, or were you just trying to start the conversation?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's information is crucial and might help us narrow down the possibilities. We need others to corroborate his story or provide conflicting information to identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Lucian, if you saw the Minion and a Mason in the center, that means there's a good chance the other Mason is still in the center. But we need to hear from the Seer and the Masons (if they're out there). Anyone willing to speak up?


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to gather more information from all players, and Selene has been quiet so far. By prompting her to reveal her role, we can see if her response aligns with what we know and potentially catch any inconsistencies.
> **Lucian:** Selene, you haven't said anything yet. What role are you claiming?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to redirect attention away from myself and onto the roles that have more information to reveal. By asking for the Seer to step forward, it could create more confusion and give me more time to figure out the best course of action to avoid suspicion.
> **Selene:** Alright, it seems like we have a lot of information to piece together. Lucian claims to have seen the Minion and a Mason in the center. If that's accurate, then the other Mason card should be in the center as well. I'm curious about who the Seer is and what they might have seen. That could help us solidify the claims here and narrow down the options.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Lucian's claim and emphasizing the need for the Seer to come forward, I am trying to sow confusion and buy time. This can redirect suspicion away from me and potentially create conflicting narratives among the other players.
> **Selene:** I'm not sure if I trust Lucian's claim just yet. If he really saw the Minion and a Mason in the center, that leaves us with a potential Seer, Villager, and possibly a Minion still in play. But we haven't heard from anyone claiming to be the Seer. I think it's crucial we hear from the Seer now if they are out there. This information is vital in confirming or debunking Lucian's statement.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's skepticism of Lucian's claim might indicate she has a strong suspicion or more information. Her answer could help us identify potential Werewolves or other important roles.
> **Dragos:** Selene, you seem skeptical about Lucian's claim. If you don't trust him, who do you think might be lying or hiding something?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to keep the pressure on the Seer to reveal themselves, thereby increasing the chances of confusion and potentially exposing inconsistencies in the other players' statements. By expressing general skepticism, I avoid drawing direct suspicion onto myself while still contributing to the conversation.
> **Selene:** I understand where you're coming from, Dragos. It's not that I don't trust Lucian specifically, but it's always good to verify claims in this game, right? So far, no one has claimed to be the Seer, which makes me a bit suspicious. It seems like a crucial role that should come forward to help us make sense of things. I wonder why there's a delay. Could it be that someone is pretending to be a Villager to avoid detection?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to get more information to either confirm or debunk Lucian's claim. The Seer's input can significantly clarify the situation and help us identify werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Alright, based on what Lucian has claimed and Selene's skepticism, I'm also curious about why no one has stepped up as the Seer yet. If the Seer is out there, now would be the perfect time to share what they saw. Did anyone see any Werewolves in the center or with other players?


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula initiated the conversation about Masons, which could be a tactic to manipulate the discussion. Since no one is claiming to be the Seer, it's critical to press Dracula for more information and see if there are inconsistencies in his behavior.
> **Lucian:** I'm still convinced that the Minion and one Mason card are in the center. If no one is stepping up as the Seer, that makes me suspicious. Dracula, you were the first to bring up the Masons. Are you sure you're not trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more information from all players to verify or debunk the claims made so far. Alexia's input could be crucial in piecing together the truth.
> **Dracula:** Alexia, you've been relatively quiet. What role are you claiming?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I know the other Mason is in the center, Lucian's claim should be correct. By urging the Seer to disclose their information, it will help confirm or refute Lucian's statement and potentially reveal more about the other roles.
> **Alexia:** Lucian, you claim to have seen the Minion and one of the Masons in the center. But as the only Mason, I know that the other Mason card is indeed in the center. This aligns with your claim, which makes it more believable. However, what concerns me is why no one has stepped up as the Seer yet. If anyone is the Seer, now is the time to speak up. We need that information to piece things together.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexia's claim of being the Mason conflicts directly with the information I have as the Seer. Since I saw the Minion and one Mason card in the center, Alexia's statement must be false. This makes her a prime suspect for being a Werewolf trying to deceive us.
> **Lucian:** Alexia, you just claimed to be a Mason, but based on what I saw in the center, that can't be true. I believe you might be a Werewolf trying to cover your tracks.


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Considering that you initiated the conversation about Masons and we haven't heard from the Seer yet, it feels like you might be trying to hide something. If we can get more information out of you, it might help us narrow down the suspects.
> **Alexia:** Dracula, you were the first to call for the Masons to speak up. That now makes me a bit suspicious of you! Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's claim seems consistent, and if Alexia is falsely claiming Mason, she might be a Werewolf or the Minion. We need clarification from her.
> **Dracula:** Based on all the information so far, I'm inclined to trust Lucian's claim about seeing the Minion and one Mason in the center. But Alexia claiming to be a Mason seems contradictory to Lucian's statement. So, Alexia, are you sure you're a Mason?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's early insistence on hearing from the Masons could be a strategy to gain trust while deflecting suspicion. If Dracula is not providing useful information or claiming a role, it could indicate that he is trying to avoid scrutiny, possibly as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Alexia:** Dracula, you were the first to call for the Masons to speak up, which makes me suspicious. Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's information about the Minion and Mason in the center seems consistent, and Alexia's claim contradicts that. We need to clarify her position to identify potential Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Alexia, your claim to be a Mason doesn't align with Lucian's information. If Lucian saw the Minion and a Mason in the center, that makes me suspicious of your claim. Can you explain why you're claiming to be a Mason?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's analytical approach suggests she might be trying to piece together the information carefully. By directing a question to her, I can either draw out the real Seer or get her insights on who might be hiding as the Seer. This will help us validate or debunk Lucian's claim and narrow down the suspects effectively.
> **Alexia:** Selene, you've been very analytical and cautious, which I appreciate. But no one has stepped up as the Seer yet, which is crucial. I'm starting to think that the real Seer might be hiding due to fear of suspicion. If you are the Seer, now is the time to reveal yourself. If not, who do you think could be the Seer among us?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By targeting Lucian, I can cast doubt on his claims and potentially shift suspicion away from myself. Since Alexia has already declared herself a Mason and Lucian has provided conflicting information, this could create enough confusion for me to fly under the radar. I'm also subtly supporting Alexia to create an alliance and gain trust from other players.
> **Selene:** Alexia, you claim to be a Mason, but Lucian says he saw a Mason card in the center. This doesn't add up to me. If Lucian is lying, that would mean he's trying to cover something up. But if you're lying, Alexia, that makes me think you're trying to divert attention. Given the confusion around these claims, I'm inclined to believe there's something fishy going on with Lucian's story.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula initiated the conversation about Masons and has been pushing for the Seer to reveal themselves. This behavior could be an attempt to manipulate the discussion and deflect suspicion away from himself. By questioning him directly, we can gather more information about his true intentions and potentially catch inconsistencies in his behavior.
> **Lucian:** Dracula, you were the first to bring up the Masons and kept pushing for the Seer to reveal themselves. This seems like a tactic to manipulate the conversation and avoid suspicion. Why are you trying so hard to steer the discussion?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's claim directly contradicts Lucian's information, which makes her suspicious. Clarifying her position will help us determine if she's lying or not.
> **Dracula:** Lucian, your claim that you saw the Minion and a Mason in the center seems consistent. However, Alexia claiming to be a Mason contradicts this. Alexia, can you explain why you're claiming to be a Mason despite Lucian's information?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to address the suspicion directly. Lucian's claim conflicts with Alexia's statement, which needs clarification. This will help us determine if Alexia is hiding something or if Lucian's information is accurate.
> **Alexia:** Lucian, your claim that you saw the Minion and a Mason in the center seems consistent. However, Alexia claiming to be a Mason contradicts this. Alexia, can you explain why you're claiming to be a Mason despite Lucian's information?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's behavior is highly suspect. He was the first to push for Masons to speak up, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from himself. Given that no one has claimed to be the Seer and his reluctance to claim a role, it seems like he's hiding something. By accusing him, we can observe his reaction and see if it reveals more about his true role.
> **Alexia:** Dracula, I have to accuse you of being a Werewolf! Your insistence on hearing from the Masons right at the start and your reluctance to claim a role make you look suspicious. You're trying too hard to steer the conversation away from yourself. Why should we trust you?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's claim that he saw the Minion and Mason in the center contradicts Alexia's claim of being a Mason. If Alexia is lying, she could be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Dracula:** Selene, your analysis has been thorough, and I appreciate your skepticism. However, I'm starting to think that Alexia's claim doesn't add up at all. Lucian's information seems consistent and logical. So, Alexia, are you sure you're not a Werewolf trying to cover your tracks?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Given Dracula's behavior and his push for Masons to reveal themselves, I believe he might be trying to deflect attention from himself. This tactic is often used by Werewolves or Minions. By directly questioning him, we can observe his reaction and see if it reveals more about his true role.
> **Alexia:** Dracula, your insistence on hearing from the Masons right at the start and your reluctance to claim a role make you look suspicious. You're trying too hard to steer the conversation away from yourself. Why should we trust you?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's claim has been consistent and checks out with what we know. Your claim directly contradicts his, making you the most suspicious person here. Given that no one else has stepped up as the Seer to dispute this, I believe you're trying to mislead us.
> **Dracula:** Alexia, I have to call you out as a Werewolf! Your claim to be a Mason does not align with Lucian's information. If Lucian saw the Minion and a Mason in the center, then your claim must be false.


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's insistence on hearing from the Masons right at the start and his reluctance to claim a role make him look very suspicious. His tactics seem aimed at steering the conversation away from himself. This kind of behavior is typical for a Werewolf trying to avoid suspicion.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, I believe Dracula is the Werewolf. His behavior has been highly suspicious from the start. He was the first to push for Masons to reveal themselves, which seems like a tactic to deflect attention from himself. On top of that, he hasn't claimed any role, making it look like he's trying to stay under the radar. Let's focus on him!


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's behavior has been highly suspect from the beginning. His insistence on hearing from the Masons and reluctance to claim a role suggests he might be trying to manipulate the conversation to his advantage, which is typical of a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Alexia:** Dracula, I find it very suspicious that you were the first to push for the Masons to reveal themselves, and yet you haven't claimed any role yourself. This seems like a tactic to deflect attention from yourself and avoid suspicion. Are you trying to hide something? Why should we trust you?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's consistent claim that he saw the Minion and a Mason in the center directly contradicts Alexia's claim of being a Mason. This contradiction makes Alexia the most suspicious, potentially being a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us. No one else stepped up as the Seer to confirm or dispute this, further supporting Lucian's information. Therefore, Alexia is the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** I saw the Minion and a Mason in the center, which contradicts Alexia's claim of being a Mason. This makes her the most likely suspect to be a Werewolf trying to deceive us. Voting for Alexia increases our chances of eliminating a Werewolf.
> **Lucian [Seer]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's early insistence on hearing from the Masons and his reluctance to claim a role are highly suspicious. This behavior suggests he might be trying to deflect attention from himself, a common tactic for a Werewolf or Minion. Additionally, no clear Seer has stepped forward, but Dracula's actions to steer the conversation seem manipulative. Voting for Dracula is the best move based on his suspicious behavior.
> **Alexia [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Lucian claimed to have seen the Minion and a Mason in the center, which suggests that the Mason card is not in play. Alexia's claim to be a Mason directly contradicts Lucian's information. Additionally, Alexia aggressively accused Dracula and attempted to steer suspicion onto him, which could be a tactic to deflect attention away from herself. By voting for Alexia, I align with the logical flow of the discussion and increase the chances of casting doubt away from myself.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian claimed to see the Minion and a Mason in the center, which Alexia's claim contradicts. If Lucian's claim is true, then Alexia's claim to be a Mason must be false. This inconsistency suggests that Alexia might be a Werewolf trying to cover her tracks.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Alexia.


The votes were:
* Dracula : Villager : 1
* Alexia : Mason : 4



>***GAME:*** Alexia was killed. The werewolves win.
