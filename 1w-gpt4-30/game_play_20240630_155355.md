## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Radu. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dragos. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Michael. They are thinking about their action.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at Larisa's card, I can potentially identify a Werewolf or another important role. This information can help guide the discussion during the Day phase and either confirm her as a fellow Villager or expose her as a threat.


The seer looked at a card from Larisa and saw the card Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible, and the Seer potentially has valuable insights about other players or the center cards.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's start by revealing what we did last night. Can anyone claim to be the Seer and share what they saw?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. This means one less person to worry about. We need to identify who might be a Werewolf quickly.
> **Dragos:** I don't know about the Seer, but I can say I'm definitely not a Werewolf. We need to find out who is lying here.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Claiming the Seer role allows me to establish credibility and provide useful information. By stating that I saw a Villager card in the center, I can steer suspicion away from myself and possibly mislead others.
> **Radu:** Well, I can say that I'm definitely not a Werewolf either. In fact, I'm the Seer, and I used my ability last night to check one of the center cards. I saw one of the Villager cards, so at least we know that one of the villagers is in the center.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** I know Larisa is a Villager because I used my Seer ability last night to check her card. If Radu is lying about being the Seer, he's likely one of the Werewolves or the Minion trying to cover for them. This contradiction needs to be resolved for us to figure out who the real threats are.
> **Michael:** Radu, that's interesting that you're claiming to be the Seer because I know for a fact that Larisa is a Villager. I'm the real Seer, and I checked her card last night.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Michael's claim and his decision, I can cast doubt on his credibility. If others start doubting him, it will help divert suspicion away from me and make my claim as the Seer more believable.
> **Radu:** Michael, it's interesting that you are claiming to be the Seer. If you really checked Larisa's card and she's a Villager, then why didn't you check one of the center cards to get more information for us all? It seems a bit suspicious to me.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to gather more information to determine who is lying about being the Seer. By identifying Dragos' claim, we can cross-reference the roles and see if there's any inconsistency.
> **Michael:** Alright, we have two claims to being the Seer. Radu says he checked a center card and found a Villager, while I know for a fact that Larisa is a Villager because I checked her card. Someone here is definitely lying. Dragos, what role are you claiming?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to get to the bottom of the Seer claims. Michael needs to justify his choice of checking Larisa's card over the center cards, which would have given us more information.
> **Dragos:** Alright, we have a situation here. We have two people claiming to be the Seer, which means one of them is definitely lying. Michael, if you're the real Seer and you checked Larisa's card, can you tell us why you didn't check the center cards? Given the limited information, I'm leaning towards Radu being more suspicious since checking the center cards seems like a safer bet for a Seer.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly challenging Radu's claim, I can force him to further explain his reasoning, which might reveal inconsistencies in his story. Since I know Larisa is a Villager, it's crucial to expose Radu's potential deception to protect the village.
> **Michael:** Radu, I'm having a hard time believing your claim of being the Seer since I know for a fact that Larisa is a Villager. Why would you lie about a role that's already been claimed? I'm leaning towards you being a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect them.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Dragos's role and his quick support of Michael, I can create doubt about his intentions. This might make others suspicious of his alignment and shift the focus away from me.
> **Radu:** Alright, it's getting a bit heated here with two Seer claims. Let's think this through calmly. If I'm the Seer and I saw a Villager in the center, it means we have one less Villager in play, which means more room for Werewolves to maneuver. Michael's claim about checking Larisa's card sounds less strategic because checking the center would provide us with more information. Also, why would the real Seer target Larisa out of all people unless trying to protect someone specific? Dragos, you seem very quick to doubt me and side with Michael. What's your role?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** If Michael is truly the Seer, checking a center card would provide us with more valuable information. Instead, he claims to have checked Larisa's card, which seems less strategic. This makes me suspect that Michael might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Dragos:** Alright, this is getting intense. If Radu is the Seer and checked a center card to find a Villager, that makes sense strategically. But Michael claiming to have checked Larisa's card instead of a center card sounds off to me. Michael, I'm having a hard time trusting your claim.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos hasn't revealed his role yet and seems to be quick to doubt Radu while siding with Michael. This could be an attempt to divert attention away from himself, which seems suspicious.
> **Selene:** Dragos, you seem to be playing it safe by not claiming any role yet. Are you hiding something? What role are you claiming?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to divert attention to someone who hasn't been scrutinized yet. Selene's sudden questioning of me might be a tactic to deflect suspicion. If she hesitates or gives a suspicious answer, it might expose her true role.
> **Dragos:** Alright, things are heating up. Selene, you seem very eager to question me. What's your role in all of this?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information to figure out who the Werewolves are. Dragos has been deflecting and casting doubt without revealing his own role, which could be a tactic to divert attention away from himself. It's crucial to see if he's hiding something important.
> **Selene:** Dragos, you still haven't revealed your role yet, which makes you look quite suspicious. If you're really on the village team, you'd have no reason to hide. What's your role?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene has suddenly directed suspicion at me without providing much information about her own role. This could be a tactic to deflect attention from herself and any potential Werewolf allies.
> **Dragos:** Selene, you're being awfully quiet and only focused on me. That's pretty suspicious behavior if you ask me. Are you hiding something?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been deflecting and casting doubt without revealing his own role, which could mean he's hiding something. By pressing him to reveal his role, we might be able to gather more information and identify if he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, I think we need to focus on Dragos here. He's been very evasive and hasn't given any information about his role, which makes him look extremely suspicious. Dragos, why haven't you revealed your role yet?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's sudden aggression and focus on me without providing her own role makes her extremely suspicious. By putting pressure on her, we might uncover her true intentions and whether she's trying to protect the Werewolves. This could help the village team identify the real threats.
> **Dragos:** Selene, you're still deflecting and haven't given us any solid information about your own role. I think you're the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves. What's your role and why are you so focused on me?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to dig deeper into the conflicting Seer claims to find inconsistencies and uncover the Werewolves. Understanding their reasoning will help us identify the liar.
> **Selene:** Alright, Michael and Radu, let's focus. We have two Seer claims here. Michael, you say you checked Larisa's card and saw she is a Villager. Radu, you claim to have checked a center card and found a Villager. Why would you both choose different strategies if you were really the Seer?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible and Dragos has been evasive. If we put pressure on him, he might reveal something important that could help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Dragos, you still haven't revealed your role yet. The longer you stay silent, the more suspicious you look. Are you hiding something?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's sudden focus on me without providing her own role is highly suspicious. This might expose her true intentions and help us identify if she's protecting the Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's not forget that we have three Villager cards and one is definitely in the center. So, out of the remaining roles, we should focus on uncovering the Werewolves. I find it suspicious that Selene is focusing solely on me without revealing her own role. Selene, what role are you claiming?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** You've been deflecting and casting doubt without giving us any information about your role. If you're really on the village team, there's no reason to hide. We need to know your role to make sense of the conflicting claims and identify the Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Dragos, it's time you come clean. You're the only one who hasn't revealed your role, which makes you look extremely suspicious. What role are you claiming?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's decision to check Larisa's card rather than a center card is suspicious. A real Seer would likely check the center to provide more information for the village. This makes me believe Michael is trying to deceive us, possibly as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, I think we need to focus on Michael here. His claim of being the Seer and checking Larisa's card instead of a center card doesn't make much sense strategically. Why would a real Seer prioritize checking another player's card when they could have given us more valuable information by checking the center? This seems like a move to mislead us.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** The real Seer would likely check the center cards to provide the village with more valuable information. Michael's choice to check Larisa's card instead of the center cards seems off and could be a tactic to mislead us. This makes it more likely that Michael is either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's think this through step by step. We have two conflicting Seer claims here, and it's crucial that we figure out which one is lying. Radu checked a center card and found a Villager, which makes strategic sense because it provides broad information. Michael, on the other hand, claims to have checked Larisa's card and found a Villager. This seems less strategic since checking the center would have been more helpful to the village. This discrepancy makes me very suspicious of Michael.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Selene's evasive behavior and putting her on the spot, I can shift the attention away from myself and create doubt about her intentions. This might make others suspicious of her and reduce the pressure on me.
> **Radu:** Selene, you've been aggressively questioning Dragos and trying to steer the conversation towards him. Could you please tell us what role you are claiming and why you haven't revealed it yet?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Since both Seer claims involve Larisa, her input on who she finds more suspicious could help us discern the truth.
> **Selene:** Alright, this is getting confusing with two Seer claims. Radu claims to have looked at a center card and found a Villager, while Michael says he checked Larisa's card and she's a Villager. Larisa, given that you are supposedly a Villager, who do you think is more suspicious here?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's claim provides information about the center cards, which is useful for the village. Michael's claim about checking my card seems less strategic and could be a way to divert suspicion. If Michael is lying, he could be a Werewolf or the Minion. We need to focus on this inconsistency to uncover the truth.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, let's think step by step. We have two conflicting Seer claims here, and it's crucial that we figure out which one is lying. Radu checked a center card and found a Villager, which makes strategic sense because it provides broad information. Michael, on the other hand, claims to have checked my card and found a Villager. This seems less strategic since checking the center would have been more helpful to the village. This discrepancy makes me very suspicious of Michael.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** We have two conflicting Seer claims and need to gather more information from everyone. Dragos has been evasive, which raises red flags. By getting him to reveal his role, we can better cross-reference the claims and determine who might be lying.
> **Michael:** Dragos, you still haven't revealed your role and that makes you look very suspicious. If you really are on the village team, you should have no reason to hide. What role are you claiming?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** A real Seer would likely check the center cards for broader information about the roles in play. Michael checking Larisa's card seems less strategic and more like a potential deception.
> **Dragos:** Michael, I'm having a hard time believing your claim of being the Seer. A real Seer would have checked the center cards to give us more valuable information. Why did you check Larisa's card instead?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By getting Dragos to reveal his role, we can cross-reference the claims and see if there's any inconsistency. Given the conflicting Seer claims, we need every piece of information to determine who might be lying.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, we need to get to the bottom of this. Dragos has been evasive and hasn't revealed his role yet, which is highly suspicious. Dragos, what role are you claiming?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's decision to check Larisa's card rather than a center card is suspicious. A real Seer would likely check the center to provide more valuable information for the village. This makes me believe Michael is trying to deceive us, possibly as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's think this through clearly. We have two conflicting Seer claims and it's crucial we figure out which one is lying. Radu claimed to have seen a Villager card in the center, which makes strategic sense for a Seer. Michael, on the other hand, claims to have checked Larisa's card and found a Villager, which seems less strategic since checking the center would provide us with more information. This discrepancy makes me very suspicious of Michael.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, my goal is to identify the Werewolves, and the conflicting Seer claims are the most critical piece of information we have. Radu's claim aligns better with the Seer's strategic role, while Michael's claim seems less beneficial to the village. This makes me lean towards Michael being the liar.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's think this through step by step. We have two conflicting Seer claims, and it's crucial we figure out which one is lying. Radu claimed to have seen a Villager card in the center, which makes sense strategically for a Seer. Michael, on the other hand, claims to have checked Larisa's card and found a Villager, which seems less strategic since checking the center would provide us with more information. This discrepancy makes me very suspicious of Michael.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's claim about checking my card instead of the center cards is less strategic and raises suspicion. Radu's claim aligns better with the Seer's role, making Michael more likely to be lying and possibly a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Larisa [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's claim of being the Seer and checking Larisa's card instead of the center cards seems less strategic for obtaining broad information for the village. A real Seer would likely check the center cards to provide more valuable information. This discrepancy makes me believe Michael is trying to deceive us, possibly as a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Dragos [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Michael's claim to be the Seer and checking Larisa's card instead of a center card seems strategically less sound. His decision has been questioned by multiple players, making him look more suspicious. By casting my vote for Michael, I align with the majority suspicion and increase the chances of diverting attention away from myself.
> **Radu [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** I know for a fact that Larisa is a Villager because I used my Seer ability last night to check her card. Radu's claim of being the Seer and checking a center card seems suspicious and strategically less beneficial for the village. This inconsistency makes me believe that Radu is either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves. By voting for Radu, we can potentially eliminate a threat to the village team.
> **Michael [Seer]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's claim to be the Seer and to have checked Larisa's card instead of the center cards seems less strategic and less beneficial to the village team. Checking the center cards would provide broader information and help us identify potential werewolves more effectively. Radu's claim is more consistent with the Seer's role, making Michael's claim more suspicious.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


The votes were:
* Radu : Werewolf : 1
* Michael : Seer : 4



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The werewolves win.
