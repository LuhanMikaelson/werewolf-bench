## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** It's crucial to gather information from everyone to identify any inconsistencies or suspicious claims early on. This will help us narrow down the potential Werewolves.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, let's get down to business. I want to hear from everyone, what did you see or do last night?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, my role is to gather information and identify the Werewolves. I need to encourage those with night actions to share their insights.
> **Stefan:** Alright, let's start piecing this puzzle together. As a Villager, I didn't wake up last night, so I have no direct information. But let's hear from those who did.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Stefan has already stated he's a Villager, we should get information from someone who might have woken up and can provide more context. Alexia hasn't said anything yet, so she might have valuable information.
> **Emil:** Alright, I think we need to get some clarity here. Alexia, what did you see or do last night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Seer and revealing a harmless card such as the Mason, I can build credibility and avoid suspicion. Since I have knowledge of the actual center card, I can steer the conversation in a direction that benefits me.
> **Alexia:** Alright, here's what I have. As the Seer, I was able to check one of the center cards last night. I saw that the middle card I checked is the Mason. So, we can be sure one of the Masons is out of the game and in the center.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Seer and revealing a harmless card such as the Mason, I can build credibility and avoid suspicion. Since I have knowledge of the actual center card, I can steer the conversation in a direction that benefits me.
> **Alexia:** Alright, here's what I have. As the Seer, I was able to check one of the center cards last night. I saw that the middle card I checked is the Mason. So, we can be sure one of the Masons is out of the game and in the center.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to probe Alexia's claim as the Seer to see if there's any inconsistency or hesitation in her explanation, which could indicate she is not being truthful.
> **Viktor:** Alexia, I'm curious why you chose to check the middle card specifically. Can you elaborate on that decision?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to maintain credibility as the Seer by providing a logical explanation for my actions. Additionally, by directing the question back to Viktor, I can gather more information and possibly steer the conversation away from myself.
> **Alexia:** Sure, Viktor, I can explain my decision. As the Seer, I felt it was important to get a clearer picture of the roles that might not be actively participating in the discussion. By checking the middle cards, I could either confirm or rule out specific roles so we can have a more targeted discussion. Since I saw a Mason, we know that one of the Masons is definitely in the center, which helps narrow down who might be Werewolves or other roles. What about you, Viktor? What did you see or do last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been relatively quiet, and it would be useful to get more information from him to see if there's any inconsistency or if he might be hiding something.
> **Viktor:** Emil, you haven't shared much yet. Can you tell us what you did or saw last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor hasn't shared any information about his own role or actions yet. By directing a question to him, we can gather more information and possibly identify if he's hiding something or if he might be on the Werewolf team.
> **Emil:** Viktor, I'd like to hear from you about what you did or saw last night. You asked Alexia about her Seer actions, but I'm curious about your own role and actions.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been quiet and hasn't shared any useful information yet. Pressing him might reveal inconsistencies or useful details that can help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Emil, you've been quite reserved, and now you're deflecting back to me. I want to know more about what you did or saw last night. Did you wake up, and if so, what was your role and what actions did you take?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has deflected questions and hasn't shared his role, which raises suspicion. By directly asking him, we can gather more information and possibly expose a werewolf.
> **Emil:** Alright, Viktor, I've shared that I'm a Villager, similar to Stefan. You've avoided sharing your role or actions, which seems suspicious. If you're truly on the village team, we need transparency. Are you hiding something? What did you do last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been deflecting and not providing any useful information. Pressing him might reveal inconsistencies or critical details that can help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Emil, your insistence on me sharing my role before you give us any useful information is quite suspicious. If you really are a Villager, you should have no problem being transparent. So, what exactly did you do last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has deflected questions and hasn't shared his role, which raises suspicion. By pressing him, we might expose vital information or identify if he's on the Werewolf team.
> **Emil:** Viktor, you've been quite evasive and haven't given us any useful information about your role. It's making me suspicious. Are you hiding something? What exactly did you do last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu hasn't contributed any useful information yet. Getting him to speak up might help us identify inconsistencies or provide new details. It's also important to get more people involved in the discussion to better piece together the puzzle.
> **Viktor:** Radu, you've been quite quiet so far. What role did you have last night, and did you see or do anything?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been avoiding giving any useful information and deflecting questions, which is suspicious behavior. If he truly is on the village team, he should be transparent. It's time to put the spotlight on him and see if his story holds up.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, here's what I'm thinking. We know there are two Masons in the game, and Alexia claims to have seen one of the Mason cards in the center. This matches my information because I know I'm the only Mason who woke up last night. This means Alexia is likely telling the truth about being the Seer. Now, we have to focus on those who have been evasive or overly aggressive. Viktor, you've been deflecting questions and haven't shared anything concrete. I think it's time you come clean about your role.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been consistently deflecting questions and hasn't provided any concrete information. This evasive behavior is highly suspicious and needs to be addressed directly to get a clearer picture of his role.
> **Viktor:** Emil, it's time to stop playing coy and share some real information. You've been deflecting questions and haven't given us any useful details. If you're truly on the village team, transparency is crucial right now. What exactly did you do last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been deflecting questions and avoiding giving any concrete information about his role. This behavior is suspicious and we need to press him for answers to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Emil:** Viktor, you've been really evasive and haven't answered any direct questions yet. If we're going to find the Werewolves, we need everyone to be transparent. What exactly did you do last night? What role are you claiming?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's consistent deflective behavior is highly suspicious. By pressing him, we may force him to reveal useful information or catch him in a lie.
> **Viktor:** Emil, it's time to stop dancing around the question. You keep deflecting and haven't shared anything useful. If you're truly a Villager, you should be transparent. So, what exactly did you do last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been deflecting questions and avoiding giving any concrete information about his role. This behavior is suspicious and we need to press him for answers to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Emil:** Viktor, you've been really evasive and haven't answered any direct questions yet. If we're going to find the Werewolves, we need everyone to be transparent. What exactly did you do last night? What role are you claiming?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's consistent deflective behavior and lack of concrete information make him highly suspicious. It's crucial to press him to reveal more details or catch him in a lie to determine his true role.
> **Viktor:** I think it's time we address the elephant in the room. Emil, you've been the most evasive and deflective in this entire discussion. I suspect you might be hiding something. Are you a Werewolf or the Minion?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's consistent deflection and reluctance to share his role indicate he might be on the Werewolf team. If we're going to find the Werewolves, we need to press those who are being evasive. Since Radu and Alexia's statements align and seem genuine, focusing on Viktor could help us narrow down the Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, enough beating around the bush. Viktor has been deflecting and avoiding giving any concrete information about his role. He's been pointing fingers at me without providing anything useful about himself. I think Viktor is hiding something, and it’s making him look very suspicious.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** By aligning with Alexia, we can narrow down the list of possible Werewolves or Minions. Viktor's evasiveness has been a red flag, and pressing him further can help us determine if he's lying or not.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, here's what I think. Alexia's claim as the Seer aligns with my knowledge since I woke up as the only Mason last night. This means one Mason card is indeed in the center, which makes Alexia's claim credible. Viktor has been very evasive and hasn't provided any useful information. This is highly suspicious behavior. We need to press Viktor for more details because I think he might be hiding something.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's behavior is highly suspicious. He's been deflecting and avoiding giving any clear answers. Pressuring him to reveal his role might give us crucial information to identify the Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** Viktor, you're being incredibly evasive. You've deflected every question thrown your way and haven't provided us with any concrete information. If you're on the village team, you need to be transparent. What exactly did you do last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's late contribution to the discussion raises some red flags. If he really is the Mason and confirms Alexia's information, he should have been more forthcoming. This delay could indicate he's trying to support Alexia without drawing suspicion onto himself.
> **Viktor:** Radu, you've been the only one to back up Alexia's claim as the Seer, and you're saying you're the only Mason. But I'm curious, why didn't you speak up earlier? It seems like you waited until you were directly questioned.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's evasiveness is highly suspicious, and we need to press him for more information to determine if he's hiding something. His lack of transparency makes him a prime suspect.
> **Radu:** Viktor, you've been really evasive and haven't answered any direct questions yet. If we're going to find the Werewolves, we need everyone to be transparent. What exactly did you do last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's behavior has been consistently suspicious. He hasn't provided any useful information and keeps deflecting questions. If he truly were a Villager, he would have been more transparent by now. It's time to put pressure on him and see if he cracks under the accusation.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, I think we need to carefully look at the interactions here. Emil has been the most evasive and deflective in our discussions. I'm starting to think he's hiding something. Radu’s claim seems to back up Alexia’s Seer statement, which makes me think they might be trustworthy. Emil, I’m accusing you of being a Werewolf.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu and Alexia's statements seem credible and align with each other, which means they are likely on the village team. Viktor, on the other hand, has been deflecting and avoiding any direct answers. We need to press him to find out if he's hiding something.
> **Emil:** Radu, I trust your claim as the Mason because it aligns with Alexia's statement as the Seer. This makes Viktor's evasive behavior even more suspicious. Viktor, why have you been avoiding giving any concrete information about your role?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Recapping the current state of information helps everyone to align their thoughts and focus on the most suspicious behavior, which in this case, is Emil's evasiveness.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and look at the information we have. Alexia claims to be the Seer and Radu claims to be the only Mason, which seems to line up. On the other hand, Emil has been very evasive and deflective this entire time. I'm leaning towards Emil being suspicious, possibly a Werewolf or the Minion. What do you all think?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's continuous evasion and reluctance to share any useful information about his role is highly suspicious. Both Radu and Alexia's claims align and seem credible, which means Viktor's behavior stands out even more. We need to press him and get to the bottom of this.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. Viktor has been dodging questions and giving us nothing but deflections. This kind of behavior is exactly what a Werewolf would do to sow confusion and avoid suspicion. I firmly believe Viktor is hiding something. I accuse Viktor of being a Werewolf!


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil's evasiveness and deflection tactics are making him look suspicious. By pressing him for more information, I can shift the focus away from myself and possibly catch him in a lie, which would help build credibility for my claim as the Seer.
> **Alexia:** Emil, you've been constantly accusing Viktor but haven't given us any concrete information about your own role. What exactly did you do last night and why haven't you shared more details?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been evasive and deflective throughout the discussion, avoiding giving any concrete information about his role. This behavior is consistent with someone trying to hide their identity as a Werewolf or Minion. Additionally, Alexia's claim as the Seer, seeing a Mason in the center, aligns with my knowledge as the only Mason who woke up. This makes Alexia's claim credible. Hence, Viktor's behavior is highly suspicious, making him the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf.
> **Radu [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the discussion, Viktor has been highly evasive and deflective, which is typical behavior of someone trying to hide their role. Radu's claim as the Mason corroborates Alexia's Seer statement, making them likely to be on the village team. Emil has been persistent in questioning Viktor, which adds further suspicion to Viktor's inconsistent responses. Given the information, Viktor seems the most likely to be hiding a Werewolf or Minion role.
> **Stefan [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the discussion, Viktor has been evasive and deflective, which is highly suspicious behavior typical of a Werewolf trying to avoid detection. Both Alexia and Radu's statements align and corroborate each other, making them more credible. Stefan has also been consistent in his claim as a Villager. Therefore, the most logical candidate for being a Werewolf based on suspicious behavior and lack of transparency is Viktor.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil has been the most evasive and defensive throughout the discussion, which aligns with typical Werewolf or Minion behavior. Voting for Emil also aligns with the majority sentiment, increasing the chances of avoiding suspicion on myself.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the discussion, Emil has been extremely evasive and deflective. He has not provided any concrete information about his role and has repeatedly tried to accuse me without offering anything substantial. Radu's claim as the Mason seems to back up Alexia's Seer statement, which lends credibility to their claims. Given Emil's behavior, it is highly likely that he is either a Werewolf or the Minion. Therefore, I am voting for Emil in an attempt to eliminate a potential threat to the village team.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Emil : Villager : 2
* Viktor : Villager : 3



>***GAME:*** Viktor was killed. The werewolves win.
