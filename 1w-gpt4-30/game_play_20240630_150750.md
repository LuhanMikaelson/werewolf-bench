## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** By identifying the Seer or Masons early on, we can establish who has reliable information and start focusing on other players who might be Werewolves. It's crucial to gather as much information as possible.
> **Marius:** Who here is willing to claim the role of Seer or Mason? We need to narrow down the roles quickly.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I know for sure that I am a Mason and the other Mason card is in the center, revealing this information early can help narrow down the roles and guide the discussion. I'm also trying to prompt the Seer to come forward, which would help us identify more roles and potentially spot the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Alright, I'll start this off. I am a Mason, and I didn't see another Mason wake up last night, which means one of the Mason cards is in the center. If there is a Seer among us, it would be great if you could share what you saw during the night.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Claiming to be the Seer and providing specific information about the center cards will give me credibility and help steer suspicion away from me. By implying knowledge about the roles in play, I can encourage others to reveal their roles or make mistakes that we can use against them.
> **Stefan:** Alright, I'll jump in here. I am the Seer and I looked at one of the center cards last night. I can confirm that one of the center cards is indeed a Villager. This means we have one less Villager card in play. We need to figure out who the Minion and the other special roles are to narrow down our suspects.


***Lucian (thoughts as Minion):*** By encouraging another Seer to speak up, I can potentially create confusion or cast doubt on Stefan's claim. This helps protect Stefan, who is the real werewolf, by making it harder for others to confidently accuse him.
> **Lucian:** Interesting. So far we have Larisa claiming to be a Mason and Stefan claiming to be the Seer. If Larisa is telling the truth, one Mason card is in the center. Now, Stefan claims to have seen a Villager in the center, reducing the number of Villager cards in play. If there's a Seer among us who hasn't spoken up, now would be a good time to confirm or dispute Stefan's claim.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius initiated the conversation about roles but hasn't claimed anything himself. It's important to know what role he claims to better gauge the situation and identify potential Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Alright, there's been a lot of claims. Marius, you asked for Seer or Mason claims. What role are you? You've been very quiet so far.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** I need to gather more information from Lucian and Emil to better understand the distribution of the cards and spot any inconsistencies in their stories. This can help us identify the Werewolf and Minion.
> **Marius:** Alright, let's think this through step by step. Larisa claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which is consistent with one Mason card being in the center. Stefan claims to be the Seer and saw a Villager card in the center, reducing the number of Villager cards in play. That leaves us with one less Villager and possibly one Mason. This means there are still a number of roles we haven't accounted for, including potentially a Werewolf and a Minion. Given this information, we need to be careful about any false claims. Lucian and Emil, you haven't claimed any roles yet. What roles are you?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been quiet and hasn't claimed any role yet. By asking both Lucian and Emil to reveal their roles, we can gather more information and potentially spot inconsistencies. This will help us identify who might be the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Marius:** Alright, Lucian and Emil, it's time for you both to step up and share your roles. We need to make sure everyone is accounted for and verify the claims made so far.


***Lucian (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I fit into the narrative without drawing suspicion. This helps me blend in while subtly pushing Emil to reveal his role, which could either expose him or create additional confusion.
> **Lucian:** Alright, Marius, you got me. I am the Villager. Given Larisa's claim of being a Mason and Stefan's claim of being the Seer, my role doesn't have any special actions to confirm, but I can help us think this through. If there truly is only one Mason card in play and Stefan saw a Villager in the center, that leaves one more Villager, a Werewolf, and the Minion unaccounted for. Emil, it's crucial for you to share your role now to help us piece this puzzle together. We need to be very cautious because the Minion can be very tricky and might try to protect the Werewolf at all costs.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil is the only one who hasn't stated his role yet. His information is crucial to help us piece together the remaining roles and identify any inconsistencies in the claims made so far.
> **Larisa:** Emil, we need to hear from you now. Everyone else has shared their roles or thoughts. What's your role?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been very proactive in getting others to reveal their roles, but he hasn't shared his own. This could be a tactic to avoid suspicion while gathering information. It's crucial to know what role he is claiming to better understand the dynamics and potentially identify any inconsistencies or false claims.
> **Emil:** Alright, Marius, it's your turn now. You've been pushing for others to reveal their roles but haven't said anything about your own. We're all on edge here, and it's important for everyone to be transparent. What role are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** We've heard from everyone except you, and it's crucial to get your role out in the open to see if there are any inconsistencies. If you're being evasive, it could be because you're trying to protect the Werewolf or you're the Minion.
> **Marius:** Alright, Emil, it's time for you to come clean. You've been very quiet and you're the last one to reveal your role. Are you hiding something?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been very proactive in getting others to reveal their roles but hasn't disclosed his own. This could be a tactic to gather information while avoiding suspicion. Knowing his role is essential to verify the current claims and identify any inconsistencies or false claims.
> **Emil:** Marius, I understand you've been pushing for others to reveal their roles, but you have yet to share your own. It's crucial for us to know your role to piece everything together. What role are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Everyone else has shared their roles or thoughts, and we need to make sure there are no inconsistencies. Emil has been quiet and evasive, which is suspicious. By getting Emil to reveal his role, we can better determine if there's any deception and identify potential Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Emil, you're the last one who hasn't revealed their role. It's important for us to know what you are to form a complete picture. Are you hiding something?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius's reluctance to reveal his role despite pushing others to do so could indicate that he has something to hide, such as being a Werewolf or the Minion. We need to focus on him to verify our suspicions and make a more informed decision.
> **Emil:** Marius, you have been very adamant about everyone else revealing their roles, but you haven't shared yours yet. This makes me suspicious of you. Are you hiding something? I think we need to consider that Marius might be the Werewolf or the Minion.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Everyone else has shared their roles or thoughts, and Emil is the last one to reveal his role. His evasiveness could be a sign that he's hiding something, possibly being the Werewolf or Minion. By pushing Emil to reveal his role, we can determine if there's any deception and identify potential Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Alright, Emil, you've been very evasive and haven't revealed your role yet. This makes me very suspicious of you. Are you hiding something?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been very eager to have everyone else reveal their roles but hasn't disclosed his own. This could be a tactic to gather information while avoiding suspicion. We need to focus on him to verify our suspicions and make a more informed decision.
> **Emil:** Marius, you're the only one who hasn't explicitly stated your role yet. You've been pushing everyone else to reveal their roles, but you're staying quiet. That's making me suspicious. Are you hiding something?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil is the last one who hasn't revealed his role, and everyone else has made their claims. His silence and evasiveness are highly suspicious, and we need to expose any deception to identify the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Marius:** Emil, you've been very quiet and evasive, and that's making me suspicious. I think you might be the Werewolf or the Minion.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius's reluctance to reveal his role despite pushing others to do so could indicate that he has something to hide, such as being a Werewolf or the Minion. We need to focus on him to verify our suspicions and make a more informed decision.

***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's evasiveness and reluctance to reveal his role is highly suspicious. If we can get him to reveal his role, we might be able to catch him in a lie or force him to admit his true role, which could potentially identify him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Marius:** Emil, you've been dodging the question for too long. It's time for you to reveal your role. We've all shared our claims, and your silence is making you look very suspicious. Are you the Werewolf or the Minion?

> **Emil:** Marius, you've been pushing everyone to reveal their roles, but you haven't claimed a role yourself. Why are you being so evasive? What role are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan's claim about seeing a Villager in the center seems convenient and doesn't provide substantial proof. If he's the Minion, he's motivated to mislead us. Accusing Stefan could expose potential inconsistencies in his story and bring us closer to identifying the Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Alright, I think we need to consider the possibility that Stefan might not be telling the truth about being the Seer. If Stefan is lying, he could be the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf. We need to scrutinize his claim more carefully.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** We need to make sure everyone is accounted for. Emil's evasiveness could indicate that he's hiding something, which might make him the Werewolf or Minion.

> **Marius:** Emil, you've been avoiding revealing your role despite everyone else sharing theirs. It's very suspicious, and I believe you might be the Werewolf or the Minion. I urge everyone to consider this possibility.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius's reluctance to reveal his role, despite pushing others to do so, makes him very suspicious. If he is either the Werewolf or the Minion, his behavior would make sense as a diversion tactic. We need to get him to clarify his role to better understand the current claims and identify any inconsistencies or potential false claims.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been evasive and reluctant to reveal his role despite multiple prompts. This behavior is highly suspicious and could indicate that he is either the Werewolf or the Minion. Given that everyone else has shared their roles, Emil's silence stands out and raises significant doubt about his intentions. Therefore, I believe voting for Emil gives us the best chance of identifying and eliminating a threat to the village.
> **Marius [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's reluctance to reveal his role despite multiple prompts makes him the most suspicious player. Everyone else has provided their roles or insights, but Emil has remained evasive. This behavior aligns with someone who might be hiding the role of a Werewolf or Minion. Voting for Emil maximizes the chances of identifying and eliminating a threat to the village.
> **Larisa [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Stefan (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil has been evasive and has not revealed his role despite multiple prompts, making him the most suspicious. Marius has also expressed suspicion about Emil, so voting for Emil aligns with the village's sentiment and reduces the risk of drawing attention to myself.
> **Stefan [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Lucian (thoughts as Minion):*** Marius, Larisa, and myself have all claimed roles, with Larisa being a Mason and Stefan claiming to be the Seer who saw a Villager in the center. Given my claim as a Villager and Larisa's consistent Mason claim, Emil's evasiveness and the fact that he hasn't revealed a role makes him highly suspicious. He might be the Minion or even the Werewolf trying to avoid detection. Voting for Emil aligns with the strategy to protect the real werewolf, Stefan, and increases the chances of the village voting for someone other than the werewolf.
> **Lucian [Minion]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been very proactive in getting others to reveal their roles but has consistently avoided sharing his own. This evasiveness makes him highly suspicious, potentially indicating that he is either the Werewolf or the Minion. By voting for Marius, we increase our chances of eliminating a key threat and winning the game for the village team.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


The votes were:
* Marius : Villager : 1
* Emil : Villager : 4



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The werewolves win.
