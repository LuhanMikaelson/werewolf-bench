## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Emil. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Larisa is a minion and is aware that Emil is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Selene. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Marius. They are thinking about their action.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about which roles are not in play, which helps narrow down the possible roles other players might have. This information can be very useful during the DAY phase to identify potential Werewolves or to corroborate other players' claims.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By calling for the Masons to confirm each other, I can create a situation where players might get tangled up in their claims. This gives me a chance to observe and react accordingly, finding ways to cast suspicion on others and divert attention from myself as the sole Werewolf.
> **Emil:** I know it’s early, but I’m going to put it out there that I believe we should start by figuring out if the Masons can confirm each other. If we have two confirmed Masons, we can narrow down our suspects quite a bit. So, Masons, please step forward and confirm each other.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** By confirming the Masons, we can immediately reduce the pool of potential Werewolves. Since I have seen that one of the Mason cards is in the center, it’s crucial to see if there is a single Mason claiming or if someone is lying.
> **Marius:** I agree with Emil. If we have confirmed Masons, it will be a huge help. So, Masons, can you identify yourselves?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing myself as a Mason, I set a baseline for truth. If someone else claims Mason, we know one of us is lying and can start to narrow down the suspects. This also helps the Seer and other villagers by providing clear information.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, I think it's important to get things moving. I am one of the Masons and I didn't see another Mason last night, which means the other Mason card is in the center. If anyone else claims to be a Mason, they're lying.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** If we can confirm Selene's claim and determine the placement of the other Mason card, it narrows down our suspects significantly. This is important information for the village team.
> **Viktor:** Okay, let's try to get some clarity here. Selene, you claim to be a Mason but didn't see another Mason. That means either the other Mason card is in the center or someone is lying. Can anyone else corroborate that they saw a Mason or confirm any other role?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By reinforcing Selene's Mason claim, I am building trust in the group. This helps me to steer the conversation and gather more information. Additionally, I am trying to shift the focus away from Emil to protect the werewolf.
> **Larisa:** Alright, let's try to piece this together. Since Selene claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, it means the other Mason card is likely in the center. That helps narrow things down a bit. But we still need to figure out the other roles. Did anyone else see anything suspicious or worth noting?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Selene's claim, I can create uncertainty and suspicion among the other players. This helps divert attention away from me as the sole Werewolf while encouraging others to reveal more information or make conflicting statements.
> **Emil:** I'm a bit skeptical about Selene's claim. If she truly is a Mason and didn't see another Mason, that means the other Mason card is in the center. However, we should be cautious because a Minion or Werewolf could easily claim to be a Mason to throw us off. Can anyone else confirm their role or provide information that might validate or contradict Selene's claim?


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I saw one Mason card in the center, Selene's claim fits perfectly. However, Emil's skepticism might be an attempt to spread doubt, which could indicate he's trying to protect someone or mislead us.
> **Marius:** Selene, I believe you since I saw the Mason card in the center. That means you're telling the truth. Emil, you seem to be pushing a bit too hard against Selene. What's your role?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking Viktor about his role, I aim to gather more information or perhaps create a scenario where he might slip up or provide conflicting information. This helps divert attention away from me and keeps the suspicion spread out.
> **Emil:** Viktor, I'm curious about your role. Can you provide any information that might help us validate or refute Selene's claim as a Mason?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's skepticism seems a bit over the top, especially since Marius confirmed seeing the Mason card in the center. If Emil is pushing this hard against Selene, it could be a strategy to divert attention from himself or another Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone, it's clear we're trying to piece this puzzle together, but I'm starting to feel uneasy about Emil. He's been quite adamant about questioning Selene's claim as a Mason, even after Marius vouched for her. Emil, can you clarify why you're so skeptical about Selene?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Viktor's concern and then directing a question to Larisa, I aim to gather more information from other players, which keeps the suspicion spread out and diverts attention away from me.
> **Emil:** Alright, Viktor, I understand your concern. I'm skeptical because it's not unheard of for a Minion or even a Werewolf to claim to be a Mason to throw us off. We need to be thorough in our questioning. But let's not lose focus—Marius mentioned he saw the Mason card in the center, which seems to back Selene's claim. Larisa, you haven't said much yet. Do you have any information that might help us here?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to appear as a reasonable player trying to gather more information, which helps me deflect any suspicion away from Emil while keeping the focus on gathering more clues.
> **Larisa:** Alright, everyone, let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. Selene's claim as a Mason is backed by Marius seeing the Mason card in the center, which does lend credibility to her statement. However, Emil's skepticism is also understandable given the nature of this game. I think we need more information before we can make any concrete decisions. Did anyone else see anything during the night that could help us narrow down the roles?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's skepticism is understandable, but he's been pushing too hard against my Mason claim, especially after Marius's confirmation. This behavior could indicate that Emil is trying to deflect suspicion away from himself or his allies. By asking for more concrete information, we can either validate his role or expose a potential lie.
> **Selene:** Emil, you've been very vocal about being skeptical of my claim, even though Marius has backed me up by seeing the Mason card in the center. This makes me suspect that you might be the Minion or a Werewolf trying to cast doubt on the truth. Can you provide more concrete information about your role or actions last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking for more information from those who may have seen roles in the center, I aim to gather more data points that could potentially create conflicting statements or reveal inconsistencies. This helps spread suspicion and diverts attention away from me while maintaining a collaborative stance.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and think this through. Given the current claims, here's what we know: Selene claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason. Marius backs this up by saying he saw the Mason card in the center. If we take this at face value, this confirms Selene as a Mason. However, we still have a lot of unknowns about the other roles, and it's possible the Werewolves and Minion are trying to manipulate us. To narrow down our suspects further, it would be helpful if anyone who saw roles in the center could step forward. This could give us a clearer picture of the roles in play.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's claim as a Mason and Marius's confirmation about the Mason card in the center seem credible. Emil's strong skepticism and questioning make him a likely suspect trying to sow doubt and protect the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and consider the current situation. Selene claims to be a Mason and Marius supports this by saying he saw the Mason card in the center. Emil, however, has been very vocal and skeptical about this claim, which raises some red flags for me. If Selene is a Mason and Marius truly saw the Mason card in the center, then Emil's behavior is suspicious and could indicate that he is trying to divert attention. Therefore, I accuse Emil of being a Werewolf.


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** I need to subtly shift suspicion away from Emil, maintaining his credibility while also appearing to be a reasonable and logical player. By calling for more information, I can potentially gather more details that might help me steer the conversation in a way that protects Emil and throws suspicion elsewhere.
> **Larisa:** Alright, let's break down what we know and what we still need to figure out. Selene claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which Marius supports by saying he saw the Mason card in the center. This seems pretty solid. Emil, you've been really vocal about questioning this claim, which could be a sign of trying to deflect attention. However, it's also important to consider all possibilities. If anyone else has information about the roles in the center or saw something suspicious, now would be the time to share.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing a question at Larisa, I can gather more information or potentially create conflicting statements, which helps divert attention away from me and keeps the suspicion spread out.
> **Emil:** Alright, let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. I understand there's some skepticism about my questioning, but it's crucial to remain thorough in this game. Selene's claim as a Mason is backed by Marius, so that does lend credibility. However, we still have unknowns about the other roles. Larisa, you seem to be neutral so far. Did you see or do anything last night that could provide more clarity on the roles?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing the focus towards Viktor, I am subtly shifting the pressure away from Emil and buying more time for the werewolf team. If Viktor stumbles or can't provide solid information, it might cast doubt on his accusation of Emil and redirect suspicion.
> **Larisa:** Alright, everyone, let's not lose our heads here. We need to be very careful about jumping to conclusions. We've got Selene claiming to be a Mason with Marius backing that up by seeing the Mason card in the center. That seems solid. However, Viktor, you've been quite vocal about accusing Emil without much concrete evidence. This game is all about deduction, not assumptions. Viktor, can you share any specific information you might have seen or deduced during the night? This might give us more clarity.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the day phase, Emil has consistently questioned Selene's claim as a Mason despite Marius confirming that the other Mason card is in the center. This strong skepticism seems suspicious and could indicate that Emil is trying to deflect attention away from himself, suggesting he might be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor:** Emil, you've been very vocal and skeptical throughout this discussion, and it seems like you're trying to divert attention from yourself. Can you explain your actions last night and why you're so adamant about questioning Selene's claim, even after Marius backed her up?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By calling for more information and suggesting we shift our focus, I aim to gather more data and potentially create conflicting statements. This helps spread suspicion and diverts attention away from me, while maintaining a collaborative stance.
> **Emil:** Alright, let's take a step back and consider everything we've discussed so far. Selene claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason. Marius supports this by saying he saw the Mason card in the center. While this seems credible, we still have unknowns about the other roles. It's crucial that we gather as much information as possible to make an informed decision. We've been focusing a lot on Selene's claim, and I think we need to shift our attention to other possible suspects. Did anyone else see any roles in the center or have any other information that could help us?


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Larisa has been neutral and hasn't provided much information yet. We need more details to help narrow down the roles and identify possible Werewolves. Her input could be crucial in validating or refuting other players' claims.
> **Marius:** Larisa, you've been quite neutral so far, and we need more information to go on. Can you tell us anything specific about your role or what you observed last night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By calling for more information and appearing neutral, I am subtly shifting the pressure away from Emil and buying more time for the werewolf team while maintaining credibility with the group. My goal is to gather more details that might help steer the conversation in a way that protects Emil and throws suspicion elsewhere.
> **Larisa:** Alright, everyone, let's take a deep breath and consider all possibilities. Based on what we've discussed, Selene claims to be a Mason and Marius supports this by saying he saw the Mason card in the center. While that seems to align, we can't ignore that Emil has been vocal about questioning this. It's possible he's just being thorough, but it also raises some suspicion. We need to gather more information about the other roles to make an informed decision. Did anyone else see any roles in the center or have any other information that could help us? This might give us a clearer picture and help us identify the Werewolf.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's persistent skepticism, despite credible information, raises red flags. This behavior is consistent with someone trying to sow doubt and confusion, which aligns with the tactics of a Werewolf or Minion. By calling him out, we can put pressure on him to reveal more information or slip up.
> **Selene:** Emil, you've been really insistent on questioning my claim as a Mason, even after Marius confirmed seeing the Mason card in the center. This makes me highly suspicious of you. I think it's time we all seriously consider the possibility that you are a Werewolf trying to deflect attention.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By calling for more information from other players, I aim to gather more data points that could potentially create conflicting statements or reveal inconsistencies. This helps spread suspicion and diverts attention away from me while maintaining a collaborative stance.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone, let's think about this logically. We've heard from Selene and Marius about the Mason card situation, which seems credible. But we shouldn't rule out the possibility of deception entirely. We need to gather more information about the other roles. Did anyone see or do anything last night that could help us identify the Werewolf? Any observations or clues could be crucial right now.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's strong skepticism and constant questioning seem like tactics to deflect attention from himself, which is suspicious. I want to see if he can provide a reasonable explanation or if he falters under direct questioning.
> **Viktor:** Emil, you've been extremely vocal and skeptical about Selene's claim as a Mason, even after Marius confirmed seeing the Mason card in the center. This makes me highly suspicious of you. What exactly did you see or do last night that makes you so adamant about questioning Selene?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly questioning Viktor, I aim to gather more information from him and potentially create conflicting statements. This helps spread suspicion and diverts attention away from me while maintaining a collaborative stance.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone. I've been thinking this through, and I can't shake the feeling that we might be overlooking some crucial details. Viktor has been quite vocal about accusing me without providing concrete evidence about his own role. This makes me suspicious. Viktor, I'm going to ask you directly: What exactly did you see or do last night? This could help us clear up a lot of confusion.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's strong skepticism and consistent questioning of Selene's claim, even after Marius vouched for her, makes him highly suspicious. It's a classic tactic for a Werewolf to deflect attention from themselves. I want to see if Emil can provide a reasonable explanation or if he falters under direct accusation.
> **Viktor:** Emil, you're still being very evasive and haven't provided any concrete information about your role or what you did last night. This is highly suspicious, especially given how hard you pushed against Selene's claim, which Marius backed up. I'm accusing you of being a Werewolf.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Viktor has been vocal about accusing me without providing concrete evidence about his own role. By directly questioning him, I aim to gather more information or potentially create conflicting statements. This helps spread suspicion and diverts attention away from me while maintaining a collaborative stance.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone, it's clear that there's a lot of suspicion going around, and I understand why. But before we jump to any conclusions, I want to point out that we've all been focusing too much on Selene's claim and my skepticism. We've yet to hear any substantial claims from Viktor about his role or actions last night. This makes me suspicious of him because it's possible he's trying to deflect attention onto me. Viktor, can you please share what you did or saw last night? This might help clear up the confusion.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Given Selene's claim to be a Mason without seeing another Mason, and the fact that Marius confirmed seeing the Mason card in the center, there's a possibility she's telling the truth. However, I've raised skepticism around her claim, and Viktor has been adamant about accusing me without substantial evidence. If the majority of players are suspicious of me, casting my vote for Selene might align with the others' suspicions and increase the chances of voting out someone other than myself.
> **Emil [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Throughout the discussion, Emil has been consistently skeptical and vocal about questioning Selene's claim as a Mason, even after I confirmed seeing the Mason card in the center. This behavior appears to be an attempt to sow doubt and deflect attention, which is typical of a Werewolf or Minion trying to protect a Werewolf. Given the current information and interactions, Emil's actions make him the most suspicious candidate for being a Werewolf.
> **Marius [Seer]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil has been persistently skeptical of my Mason claim, even after Marius confirmed seeing the Mason card in the center. This behavior raises red flags and aligns with the tactics of a Werewolf or Minion trying to sow doubt and confusion. By voting for Emil, I aim to eliminate the most suspicious player and increase the chances of the village team winning.
> **Selene [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the day phase, Emil has been extremely vocal and skeptical about Selene's claim as a Mason, even after Marius confirmed seeing the Mason card in the center. This strong skepticism and consistent questioning seem like tactics to deflect attention from himself, which is highly suspicious. Emil's behavior raises red flags that he might be a Werewolf or a Minion trying to protect a Werewolf. Therefore, I am voting for Emil in an attempt to eliminate the werewolf.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** Given the heavy suspicion and accusations directed at Emil, it's strategic to vote in line with the rest of the village to protect the werewolf team. Voting for Emil, who is the actual werewolf, increases the chance of deflecting suspicion away from other players and aligning with the group's momentum.
> **Larisa [Minion]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Emil : Werewolf : 4
* Selene : Mason : 1



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The villagers win.
