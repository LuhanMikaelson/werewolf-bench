## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Michael. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Selene is a minion and is aware that Michael is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Radu. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.

There is one seer in play, Larisa. They are thinking about their action.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By checking two center cards, I can gather more information about what roles are not in play. This will help me identify possible false claims during the day phase and assist the village team in making more informed decisions.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Starting with claims helps us identify contradictions and gives us a better chance to catch the Werewolf. By claiming Villager, I blend in and deflect suspicion from Michael, the actual Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Hey everyone, I think it's crucial for us to start by figuring out who's claiming what roles. I'll go first: I'm a Villager. What about the rest of you?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to get everyone to state their roles early on. Radu hasn't said anything yet, and we need as much information as possible to identify inconsistencies and potential Werewolves.
> **Alexia:** Alright, Selene, you're claiming Villager. I'm also a Villager. We need to get to the bottom of this. Radu, what role are you claiming?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to gather more information from everyone to start making connections and identifying inconsistencies. Knowing Michael's claim will help us get a clearer picture.
> **Radu:** Alright, interesting that both Selene and Alexia are claiming Villager. Michael, what role are you claiming?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Claiming to be the Seer and providing useful information about the center card helps to establish trust. By revealing that the other Werewolf card is in the center, I cast suspicion away from myself and make it seem like I’m helping the village team.
> **Michael:** Alright, interesting that both Selene and Alexia are claiming Villager. I’m going to be upfront and say I’m the Seer. During the night, I chose to look at two of the center cards, and I can confirm one of them is the other Werewolf card. So we know for a fact that there's only one Werewolf among us.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to gather Larisa's claim to cross-check against the other claims and potentially spot any inconsistencies.
> **Radu:** Alright, Michael, that's quite a strategic move claiming Seer and looking at the center cards. But if you're the real Seer, then we have an advantage. I'm curious though, Larisa, you haven't said much. What role are you claiming?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's claim as the Seer conflicts with the information I have as the real Seer. By questioning him directly, I can expose any inconsistencies in his story and help identify if he's lying about his role, potentially revealing him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Larisa:** Michael, I find it very interesting that you claimed to be the Seer and saw one of the Werewolf cards in the center. But I also looked at two center cards, and I can confirm that one of them was the Mason and the other was a Villager. Which center card did you see as the Werewolf?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Larisa's claim and pointing out the contradiction, I can cast doubt on her statement and create confusion. This will make it harder for others to trust her and may shift suspicion away from me.
> **Michael:** Larisa, that's really interesting that you claim to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center. The card I saw was actually the middle card to the left, which was a Werewolf. If you're also claiming to have seen the center cards, it seems like there's a contradiction here. Could you clarify which cards you actually looked at?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By challenging Michael's claim directly, I can bring attention to the contradiction and gather more information from other players. This will help us identify if Michael is lying and potentially expose him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Larisa:** Michael, your claim is suspect. I clearly saw a Mason and a Villager in the center cards. There's no way a Werewolf card is there. I think you're lying to cover for yourself or someone else. Can anyone else confirm what they saw or their roles?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Radu hasn't claimed a role yet, it's crucial to get his input to gather more information and assess the validity of the existing claims. This will help identify any inconsistencies and potentially expose any deceit.
> **Larisa:** Radu, you haven't claimed your role yet. What exactly are you? Given the conflicting claims, we need more information to make the right decision.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claim about the center cards aligns with what I might expect based on my role as a Mason. Michael's conflicting claim about seeing a Werewolf card in the center raises doubts. We need to press Michael for more details to uncover any inconsistencies.
> **Radu:** Alright, everyone, let's focus here. I'm highly suspicious of Michael's claim to be the Seer. Larisa's information seems more credible since I've heard nothing to contradict her yet. Michael, if you’re the Seer, why would Larisa and you have such conflicting information?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting pressure on Radu to reveal his role, I can gather more information and potentially find inconsistencies in other players' claims, deflecting suspicion from myself.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, this is getting complicated. Let’s try to piece this together. If Larisa claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager, and I claim to have seen a Werewolf among the center cards, then one of us is definitely lying. Selene and Alexia both claimed Villager, which are simple roles to claim without any proof. Radu, you need to state your role to help us get a clearer picture.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claim about the center cards aligns with my knowledge as a Mason. Michael's conflicting claim about seeing a Werewolf card in the center raises serious doubts. We need to press Michael for more details to uncover any inconsistencies and determine if he's lying.
> **Radu:** Alright, let's address the elephant in the room. I'm highly suspicious of Michael's claim to be the Seer. Larisa's information about the center cards seems more aligned with what a Mason would see and makes more sense. Michael, if you're the real Seer, why would Larisa have such contradictory information? It doesn't add up.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting pressure on Radu to reveal his role, I can gather more information and potentially find inconsistencies in other players' claims, deflecting suspicion from myself.
> **Michael:** Radu, your reluctance to claim a role is suspicious. Given the conflicting information between Larisa and me, it's crucial for us to hear your role to get a clearer picture. If you're genuinely a Villager or another role, you should have no problem sharing it.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center aligns with my knowledge as a Mason and makes more sense. Michael's conflicting story raises serious doubts about his honesty. This inconsistency suggests Michael might be covering for the Werewolf team, so we need to focus on him.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, let's cut through the confusion here. Michael, your claim about seeing a Werewolf in the center is highly suspect, especially when Larisa's information seems much more consistent with the roles we have. I believe Michael is lying to cover for himself or a fellow Werewolf.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pushing Radu to reveal his role, I’m trying to shift the focus and suspicion away from myself. This might also create distrust between Larisa and Radu, as their claims seem to align against mine.
> **Michael:** Larisa, I'm sticking to my claim. The card I saw in the center was definitely a Werewolf. If you're saying you saw a Mason and a Villager, then one of us is lying. I find it very convenient that Radu is not revealing his role and instead is just echoing suspicion on me. Radu, it's time to come clean about your role.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's conflicting story about seeing a Werewolf card in the center raises serious doubts about his honesty. Larisa's information makes more sense and fits with my knowledge as a Mason. This inconsistency suggests Michael is trying to deceive us.
> **Radu:** Michael, your claim doesn't add up at all. Larisa's information about the Mason and Villager in the center aligns perfectly with what I'd expect, given the roles we have. I think you're lying to cover for the Werewolf team. Everyone, I believe Michael is the Werewolf or at least aligned with them, and we need to focus on him.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Radu's reluctance to reveal his role is suspicious and might indicate that he has something to hide. By pressing him to reveal his role, we can gather more information and potentially find inconsistencies in other players' claims. This also helps to shift focus and suspicion away from my role as the Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and analyze the situation logically. We have conflicting claims between Larisa and me about the center cards. Larisa says she saw a Mason and a Villager, while I claim to have seen a Werewolf. Since Selene and Alexia both claimed Villager without any proof, their claims don't add much to our understanding. Radu, however, has been avoiding revealing his role, which is highly suspicious. We need more concrete information. Radu, it's crucial that you state your role now to help clarify the situation.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claim about the center cards aligns with my knowledge as a Mason. Michael's conflicting claim suggests he's lying to protect the Werewolf team. We need to focus on him to win this for the Village.
> **Radu:** Michael, your story just isn't adding up! You're claiming to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf in the center, but Larisa's information about seeing a Mason and a Villager makes way more sense. I think you're lying to cover up for a Werewolf! Everyone, I believe Michael is the Werewolf or working with them. We need to vote him out!


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Radu's reluctance to reveal his role is making him appear suspicious. By pushing him to reveal his role, we might get a clearer picture and potentially shift the focus away from Michael, helping the Werewolf team.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, we've got a lot of conflicting information here. Larisa claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center while Michael claims to have seen a Werewolf. This could mean one of them is lying, but let's not forget that Radu still hasn't revealed his role, which is highly suspicious. If we're to believe Larisa, then Michael might be covering for someone. But if Michael is telling the truth, then Larisa might be trying to mislead us. Radu, it's high time you come clean. What role are you claiming?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claims are consistent with what I know about the Mason role being in the center. Michael's conflicting claim about seeing a Werewolf in the center makes him highly suspicious, suggesting that he's trying to deceive us to protect a Werewolf.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, based on everything we've heard, it's clear there's a major inconsistency with Michael's claims. If Larisa saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, which aligns with my own knowledge of the roles, then Michael's story about seeing a Werewolf doesn't hold water. We need to focus on Michael because he's likely covering for the Werewolf team.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Your reluctance to state your role is highly suspicious. We need to know your role to piece together the truth, especially with the conflicting claims from Michael and Larisa.
> **Alexia:** Radu, you've been avoiding revealing your role for too long. It's time for you to come clean. What role are you claiming?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claim fits with my knowledge as a Mason, where the other Mason card is in the center. Michael's story about seeing a Werewolf in the center raises serious doubts about his honesty. This inconsistency suggests Michael is trying to deceive us and protect the Werewolf team. It's crucial for the Village's win that we focus on Michael.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, based on all the claims so far, I am highly suspicious of Michael. Larisa's claim of seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center aligns with what I know. Michael's conflicting claim about seeing a Werewolf card just doesn't make sense. He's either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf. We need to vote him out!


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claim aligns with the roles we have, and Michael's conflicting claim suggests deceit. This indicates that Michael is likely trying to protect a Werewolf, making him the most suspicious player right now.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, given all the conflicting statements, I think it's clear that Michael's claim about seeing a Werewolf in the center doesn't add up at all. Larisa's information about seeing a Mason and a Villager fits perfectly with what I know. I believe Michael is lying to cover for the Werewolf team. We need to vote him out!


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Radu's avoidance of revealing his role is highly suspicious. This could mean he's trying to hide something, possibly being the Minion or Werewolf. We need his role to piece together the complete picture and see where the inconsistencies lie.
> **Larisa:** Radu, it's time to stop dodging and come clean about your role. If you're a Villager or even a Mason, you should have no problem stating your role. Your reluctance is only making you look more suspicious.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's information aligns with my knowledge as a Mason, where the other Mason card is in the center. Michael's conflicting claim about seeing a Werewolf card raises serious doubts about his honesty. This inconsistency suggests Michael is trying to deceive us and protect the Werewolf team. It's crucial for the Village's win that we focus on Michael.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, I'm getting really suspicious of Michael. Larisa's claim about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center fits perfectly with what I know. Michael's conflicting story about seeing a Werewolf doesn't add up and seems like he's trying to cover for the Werewolf team. I think Michael is the real threat here, and we need to vote him out!


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By summarizing the current claims and highlighting Radu's suspicious behavior without directly accusing him, I cast doubt on his intentions. This helps to shift the focus away from me and onto others, creating confusion and deflecting suspicion from myself as the Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and consider the situation logically. We have Selene and Alexia both claiming Villager, which doesn't give us much actionable information. Larisa claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, while I claim to have seen a Werewolf. The main point of contention here is the center cards. Given Radu's reluctance to reveal his role and his eagerness to point fingers at me, I find that highly suspicious. If we are to believe Larisa, then why is Radu so adamant without giving us any new information? This reluctance makes me think Radu might be hiding something. We need to hear clear and concise claims from everyone to sort this out.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Radu's reluctance to reveal his role is making him appear suspicious. By pushing him to reveal his role, we might get a clearer picture and potentially shift the focus away from Michael, helping the Werewolf team.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, we have a lot of conflicting claims here, and it's crucial we get to the bottom of this. Michael, you've claimed to be the Seer and seen a Werewolf in the center, while Larisa claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager. Radu, you've been very vocal about your suspicion of Michael, but you still haven't revealed your own role. That's highly suspicious. To move forward, I think we need to focus on the fact that Radu hasn't given us any new information. Radu, it's time to come clean about your role. What exactly are you?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claim aligns with my knowledge as a Mason, where the other Mason card is in the center. Michael's conflicting story about seeing a Werewolf card raises serious doubts about his honesty, suggesting that he's trying to deceive us and protect the Werewolf team.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, I've been listening carefully, and it's time to make a move. Michael's claim of seeing a Werewolf in the center doesn't add up at all, especially since Larisa's information about seeing a Mason and a Villager fits perfectly with what I know. I believe Michael is lying and is either a Werewolf or trying to protect one. We need to vote him out!


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's claim of seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center fits with the roles we have. Michael's conflicting statement about seeing a Werewolf is highly suspicious and seems like an attempt to mislead us. Radu's reluctance adds to the suspicion around Michael's claim.
> **Alexia:** Michael, your claim doesn't add up, especially with Larisa providing consistent information about the center cards. I think you're covering for the Werewolf team. Everyone, we need to focus on Michael as the primary suspect.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Radu to reveal his role, we can gather more information that might expose inconsistencies in his behavior. This also helps to deflect suspicion away from myself, creating confusion and making it harder for others to trust him.
> **Michael:** Everyone, we need to look at the facts and make sense of the claims being made. Selene and Alexia have both claimed to be Villagers, which doesn't tell us much. Larisa claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, while I claim to have seen a Werewolf. The most suspicious behavior here is Radu's reluctance to reveal his role and his insistence on pointing fingers at me. If we can't get clear information from Radu, we should be highly suspicious of him. Radu, it's time to come clean.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to deflect suspicion from Michael, the Werewolf. Given the conflicting claims and the fact that Radu hasn't revealed his role, it's crucial to create confusion among the Villagers. By voting for Michael, I can play into the narrative that Larisa and Radu are pushing, making them more likely to believe they've found the Werewolf. This increases the chance that the actual Werewolf (Michael) will survive, helping the Werewolf team win.
> **Selene [Minion]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's claim to be the Seer and seeing a Werewolf in the center conflicts with Larisa's claim of seeing a Mason and a Villager. Larisa's information seems more consistent and has not been contradicted by anyone else. Additionally, Michael's persistence and the fact that Radu has not claimed a role, yet strongly suspects Michael, further point to Michael being the most likely Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us. Voting to eliminate Michael gives us the best chance to win for the village team.
> **Alexia [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Based on the information gathered, Larisa claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, which aligns with my knowledge as a Mason that the other Mason card is in the center. Michael's conflicting claim about seeing a Werewolf card in the center doesn't add up and makes him highly suspicious. Therefore, I believe Michael is either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf team. Voting for Michael gives us the best chance to eliminate a member of the Werewolf team.
> **Radu [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** As the real Seer, I saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, which directly contradicts Michael's claim of seeing a Werewolf in the center. This inconsistency strongly suggests that Michael is lying, possibly to cover for the Werewolf team. Radu's suspicion of Michael and his alignment with my information further supports this. Voting for Michael gives us the best chance to eliminate a Werewolf or a Minion.
> **Larisa [Seer]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa's claim of seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center directly contradicts my claim of seeing a Werewolf, and her assertiveness in pushing her narrative makes her a strong candidate for suspicion. Additionally, voting for Larisa aligns with the likelihood that the village will find her contradictory claims suspicious and might vote for her, increasing the chance that I, as the Werewolf, avoid being voted out.
> **Michael [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


The votes were:
* Larisa : Seer : 1
* Michael : Werewolf : 4



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The villagers win.
