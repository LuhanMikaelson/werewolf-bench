## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Dracula. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Cristina. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Vladimir. They are thinking about their action.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can confirm whether certain roles are not in play. This information can be shared during the day phase to help guide the villagers' discussion and deductions.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.


---

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking about the Seer, I can gather information about the roles the other players might claim and possibly identify inconsistencies in their stories. This could also help me steer the conversation away from myself.
> **Dracula:** I noticed that no one has claimed to be the Seer yet. If there is a Seer among us, now would be a good time to share what you saw. It could help us identify who the werewolves are.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Cristina hasn't spoken up yet, we need to gather more information from her to help identify potential Werewolves. Her response might give us clues or contradictions that could be useful.
> **Alexandra:** Cristina, you have been quiet so far. Do you have any information that could help us identify the Werewolves?


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing I'm a Mason and that the other Mason card is in the center, I'm trying to build trust and eliminate confusion. This also puts pressure on the Seer to come forward with any valuable information they might have.
> **Cristina:** Okay, everyone, let's start clearing things up. I am a Mason, and I didn't see another Mason wake up last night, which means the other Mason card is in the center. Now, if there is a Seer here, it would be great if they could share what they saw.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula might be trying to fish for information or could be the Seer himself. By directly asking, I can gauge his response and possibly deduce his role.
> **Cristina:** Dracula, you brought up the Seer. Are you implying that you might be the Seer, or are you just trying to gather information?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question to Vladimir, I hope to gather more information about his role and see if there are any inconsistencies in his story. This can help me steer suspicion away from myself.
> **Dracula:** Cristina, I appreciate your honesty. I am not the Seer, but I was hoping to get some more information since no one claimed to be the Seer initially. So far, you’ve stated you're a Mason and the other Mason is in the center. Vladimir and Alexandra, do either of you have information that can help us identify the Werewolves?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing my role and the information I gathered will help the villagers narrow down the possibilities and identify the werewolves. Sharing this early can also prevent any false claims and guide our logic for the rest of the discussion.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone, I am the Seer. Last night, I looked at two cards in the center and saw a Villager and the Minion. This means Cristina is telling the truth about being a Mason, and there are no Minions in play. Now, Alexandra and Mircea, we need to hear from you. What do you have to say?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** To gather information from all players, it's important to hear from Mircea, who has been silent so far. Knowing his claimed role will help us piece together the puzzle and identify the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Mircea, you haven't said anything yet. What role do you claim to have?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more information, especially from players who haven't clearly stated their roles yet. Alexandra's claim could give us more insight into who might be the Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** Alright, Vladimir, you claim to be the Seer and saw a Villager and the Minion in the center. That means we have two Werewolves among us. Cristina, you say you're a Mason and didn't see another Mason wake up. Dracula, you've been trying to gather information but haven't claimed a role yet. Alexandra, you questioned Cristina but haven't said much about yourself. So, Alexandra, what role do you claim to have?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's claim as Seer and Cristina's claim as Mason are consistent with each other. However, we need more information from Mircea to determine if he is hiding something or if there are inconsistencies in his story. Accusing someone or asking for clarification can help reveal the truth.
> **Alexandra:** Vladimir, your claim as Seer is interesting, but I find it odd that Cristina claimed Mason without hesitation. If Cristina is telling the truth, then the other Mason card is in the center, which lines up with your story. But that also means we are still missing out on identifying the Werewolves. Mircea, you have been quiet and cautious, do you have anything to add?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula seems to be trying to gather information from others without revealing his own role, which is suspicious. If he is a Werewolf or Minion, this would be a strategic move to avoid detection.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, you've been asking a lot of questions but haven't claimed a role yourself. Are you hiding something? What role do you claim to have?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Villager and directing attention to Alexandra, I can try to shift suspicion away from myself and see if Alexandra's response contains any inconsistencies or helps me identify another potential target.
> **Dracula:** Mircea, you're right, I haven't claimed a role yet. I was trying to gather some information before revealing anything. I am a Villager, and I was trying to see if I could piece together who might be lying. Alexandra, you haven't claimed a role either. Can you tell us what role you have?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's behavior and late claim seem suspicious and may indicate he is trying to blend in or deflect suspicion from himself. Accusing him may force him to provide a more detailed defense.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, based on what we've heard so far, I'm getting suspicious of Dracula. He's been trying to gather information but hasn't claimed a role until now. And his Villager claim feels like it's just an easy fallback. What if he's trying to deflect attention?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been evasive and only claimed to be a Villager after being questioned multiple times. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate that he is trying to hide his real role, possibly a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, your behavior seems quite suspicious. You've been asking a lot of questions but only claimed to be a Villager after being pressed. If you really are a Villager, why didn't you say so earlier?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting the suspicion towards Mircea and pressing him to claim a role, I can potentially uncover inconsistencies in his story and shift the focus away from myself. If he struggles to provide a convincing role, it may help to cast doubt on him instead.
> **Dracula:** Mircea, I understand your suspicion, but I was genuinely trying to gather information to help us identify the Werewolves. If I had claimed Villager from the start without any information, it wouldn't have helped our discussion. Now, you've been very analytical and cautious, but you haven't claimed a role either. What role do you claim to have?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's behavior has been suspicious. He has been gathering information without revealing his role, and only claimed to be a Villager after being pressed. This evasive behavior is indicative of someone trying to hide their real role, possibly a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, I'm getting increasingly suspicious of you. You've been very evasive and only claimed to be a Villager after being questioned multiple times. Why did you wait so long to claim your role?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question to Alexandra, I aim to gather more information about her role and potentially catch her in an inconsistency. This will help shift suspicion away from me and towards her.
> **Dracula:** Alexandra, your reluctance to claim a specific role is raising eyebrows. We need transparency to identify the Werewolves, and your hesitance isn't helping. Can you tell us what role you have?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been evasive in claiming a role and only mentioned being a Villager after being pressed. This behavior is inconsistent with someone genuinely trying to help the village. His actions seem more like those of a Werewolf trying to blend in and gather information without revealing too much.
> **Alexandra:** Dracula, your behavior is just too suspicious for me to ignore any longer. You've been dodging direct claims and asking a lot of questions to deflect attention. I think you're one of the Werewolves!


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing suspicion towards Alexandra, I can try to shift the focus away from myself. Alexandra's hesitance and her attempt to accuse me seem like tactics to avoid being identified as a Werewolf. This could make her a more likely target for elimination.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, based on what we've heard so far, I'm getting suspicious of Alexandra. She's been deflecting attention and hasn't provided any specific role until pressed. It feels like she's trying to avoid scrutiny.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing suspicion towards Mircea and pressing him to claim a role, I can potentially uncover inconsistencies in his story and shift the focus away from myself. If he struggles to provide a convincing role, it may help to cast doubt on him instead.
> **Dracula:** I find it suspicious that Mircea still hasn't claimed a concrete role yet. Mircea, you seem to be very analytical, but we need to know what role you have to make an informed decision. Are you hiding something?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's evasiveness and delay in revealing his role make him a prime suspect. His actions align with someone who might be trying to hide their true identity, potentially a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, your behavior has been very suspicious. You've been asking a lot of questions and only revealed your role as Villager after being pressed multiple times. Why did you not reveal your role earlier if you are truly a Villager?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea has been cautious and analytical but hasn't claimed a clear role yet. By pressing Mircea for a specific role now, I can potentially identify inconsistencies in his story, which might shift the group's suspicion towards him and away from me.
> **Dracula:** Mircea, despite being analytical, you've avoided claiming a specific role for quite some time now. If you were a Villager or a Mason, it would've been more straightforward to state it earlier. Given the information we have, I'm finding it hard not to suspect you of being a Werewolf. Can you please clarify your role for us?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's actions align with someone who might be trying to hide their true identity, potentially a Werewolf or Minion. By pressing him further, we can see if he slips up or provides more concrete evidence to either confirm or refute our suspicions.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, I'm finding your behavior very suspicious. You've been evasive and only claimed to be a Villager after being questioned multiple times. Why did you wait so long to claim your role if you really are a Villager?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Alexandra to clarify her role, I can potentially catch her in a lie or inconsistency. This will help shift the focus away from me and create more doubt about her intentions.
> **Dracula:** Alexandra, you've been quite vague about your role. Given that we have several roles that can provide concrete information, can you please clarify what your role is?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's reluctance to claim a role and his analytical behavior make him suspicious. Pressing him for a role might reveal inconsistencies and help identify if he is a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Mircea, you’ve been very analytical and cautious, but you still haven’t claimed a role. Why are you avoiding revealing your role? Are you hiding something?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** You've been deflecting attention and haven't provided any specific role until pressed. We need transparency to identify the Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** Alexandra, your reluctance to claim a specific role is raising concerns. Can you tell us what role you have?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's evasiveness and delayed role revelation are inconsistent with someone genuinely trying to help the village. Pressing him might reveal inconsistencies and help us identify if he is a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Dracula, you've been very evasive and only claimed to be a Villager after being pressed multiple times. Your behavior seems very suspicious to me. Why did you wait so long to reveal your role if you are truly a Villager?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Alexandra to clarify her role, I can potentially catch her in a lie or inconsistency. This will help shift the focus away from me and create more doubt about her intentions.
> **Dracula:** Alexandra, you still haven't clarified your role, and your hesitation is making you look more suspicious. If you were truly a Villager or another honest role, you would have shared it by now. Given the information we have, it seems like you're trying to avoid scrutiny. Can you please tell us what role you are?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's behavior is inconsistent with someone genuinely trying to help the village. Pressing him might reveal inconsistencies and help us identify if he is a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Dracula, your evasiveness and delayed role revelation are very suspicious. You’ve been asking a lot of questions without providing much information about yourself. Why did you wait so long to claim your role if you are truly a Villager?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Vladimir's choice to look at the center cards, I can create doubt about his Seer claim. If he struggles to justify his decision, it could cast suspicion on him and shift the focus away from me. Additionally, this allows me to subtly challenge his authority without directly accusing him.
> **Dracula:** Vladimir, your claim to be the Seer is quite interesting, but I find it strange that you saw both a Villager and the Minion in the center. Since Cristina has already claimed to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, and no one has claimed the Minion role, it does seem to line up. However, it's also possible that you are trying to steer us away from the truth. Can you tell us more details about why you chose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's reluctance to claim a role and his evasiveness raise many red flags. As the Seer, I know there's no Minion in play, so any suspicious behavior should be scrutinized. Accusing Dracula will help us focus our discussion and potentially identify the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, based on what we've heard so far, I believe Dracula is acting quite suspiciously. He’s been evasive and only claimed to be a Villager after being questioned multiple times. This behavior is typical of a Werewolf trying to deflect attention.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Alexandra has been hesitant to claim a specific role and her accusations against me seemed like deflections. Given the information we have and the flow of the conversation, I believe voting for Alexandra will align with the suspicions of the group and increase the chances of not being voted out myself.
> **Dracula [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been evasive and only claimed to be a Villager after being questioned multiple times. This behavior is typical of a Werewolf trying to deflect attention. Given the information we've gathered, Dracula's actions seem the most suspicious. Voting for him gives us the best chance to eliminate a Werewolf and win the game for the village.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's evasive behavior and delayed role claim are highly suspicious. He has been asking many questions to gather information but only claimed to be a Villager after being pressed multiple times. This behavior aligns with that of a Werewolf trying to deflect attention. Based on all the interactions and the information provided by Vladimir as the Seer, Dracula is the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf.
> **Cristina [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula has been evasive and only claimed to be a Villager after being questioned multiple times. His behavior raises red flags and is typical of a Werewolf trying to deflect attention. With no Minion in play and Cristina's Mason claim being consistent, Dracula's suspicious behavior makes him the most likely candidate for a Werewolf.
> **Vladimir [Seer]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been evasive throughout the discussion, only claiming to be a Villager after being questioned multiple times. His behavior aligns with someone trying to hide their true identity, potentially as a Werewolf or Minion.
