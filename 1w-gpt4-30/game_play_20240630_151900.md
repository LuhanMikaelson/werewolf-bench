## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Emil. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dracula. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Radu. They are thinking about their action.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles that are not in play. This will help to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the potential roles of other players, making it easier to identify the Werewolves or Minion.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to start gathering information as quickly as possible. By asking if anyone wants to claim a role, we can start analyzing the responses and see if anything seems off.
> **Semira:** Alright guys, we've got to figure out who the Werewolves are. I'm curious if anyone wants to start by claiming a role?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather information quickly. By asking if any Masons or the Seer can provide information, I can help identify allies and start directing suspicion towards potential Werewolves.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, let's get this started. I'm just a regular Villager, so I'm curious if anyone saw any action last night. Did anyone wake up as a Mason or a Seer and can help us out?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the roles in the center, I can help everyone narrow down the potential roles of other players and potentially flush out false claims or identify Werewolves.
> **Radu:** Alright, let's get this moving. I want to share some useful information – I saw two cards in the center and they were Mason and Minion.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to confirm the roles and see if Radu might be lying or telling the truth. Since I know I'm a Mason, his claim about the center cards needs to be examined carefully.
> **Dracula:** Alright, Radu, you claim you saw two cards in the center, right? A Mason and a Minion? That’s quite interesting because I know for a fact that I am a Mason. So the other Mason card must indeed be in the center. But now, I’m curious about the Minion card. If you saw the Minion card in the center, that means the Minion isn't among us. I think we need more information from others to piece this together.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to verify the consistency of the claimed roles and gather more information to identify potential Werewolves. Semira hasn't shared her role yet, which could be crucial in piecing together the puzzle.
> **Radu:** Dracula, you claim to be a Mason, which aligns with the Mason card I saw in the center. But let's make sure we're covering all bases. Semira, what role are you claiming?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** If Dracula saw another Mason, it confirms his role and adds credibility to his claim. If not, it adds more suspicion to Radu's statement about seeing the Minion card in the center. This will help us narrow down potential Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Alright, Dracula, you claim to be a Mason, which lines up with Radu's claim of seeing a Mason card in the center. But I find it odd that Radu saw two cards in the center, and he's the only one who has claimed to see the Minion card. Dracula, if you’re a Mason, can you tell us if you saw the other Mason last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to gather more information from Michael to see if his claim of being a Villager is true or if he might be hiding something. His response might give us more clues to determine who the Werewolves are.
> **Dracula:** Semira, great point about the Minion. Since Radu saw both the Mason and Minion cards in the center, that leaves the possibilities for us a bit narrower. But I want to get more clarity. Michael, you claimed to be a Villager earlier, right? Can you tell us if you have any more information or if you are sticking to being just a plain Villager?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to verify Dracula's claim of being a Mason by checking if he saw the other Mason. This will help validate his role and provide clarity on the information Radu provided about the center cards.
> **Michael:** Alright, Dracula, if you are indeed a Mason, did you see the other Mason last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's vague claim could be a cover for a more nefarious role. We need to press him for more information to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Dracula:** Michael, you've been pretty quiet and only claimed to be a Villager. If you're truly a Villager, then you're not contributing much to finding the Werewolves. Given that Radu saw the Minion card in the center and I'm a Mason, your claim feels suspiciously convenient. Can you give us more specific details about your role or any observations you made that could help us?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** We have conflicting information about the center cards and Dracula being a Mason. Semira's role claim could help clarify the situation and potentially expose inconsistencies.
> **Michael:** Alright, Radu, I need to get this straight. You claim you saw a Mason and a Minion in the center. Dracula claims to be a Mason, but that only makes sense if the other Mason card is indeed in the center. Semira, you've been quiet about your role. If we want to piece this together, we need to hear from you. What role are you claiming?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's claim of being a Villager might be true, but it's not particularly useful at this stage. We need more specific information to identify the Werewolves, and directing the question to Michael could help us gauge his reactions and potentially reveal more about his role.
> **Semira:** Michael, you've been quite insistent on being just a Villager, but that doesn't provide us any valuable information. Why should we trust you? Can you offer any observations or details that could help us identify the Werewolves?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has not yet disclosed her role, and her input could be crucial in validating or refuting the information we have so far. If she claims to be a role that contradicts what others have said, it could expose inconsistencies and help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Michael:** Alright, Semira, you've been quiet about your role. If we want to piece this together, we need to hear from you. What role are you claiming?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's claim is strange and could be a way to confuse us if he's a Werewolf or Minion. We need to press him for more details to determine his true role.
> **Semira:** Radu, I find your claim suspicious. You said you saw a Mason and a Minion in the center, but Dracula claims to be the Mason, which aligns with your Mason claim. But why would you see both cards and not mention anything else? Are you sure you're not trying to mislead us?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira's reluctance to share her role is concerning, especially since we've already had some alignment between Dracula's claim and my own findings. It's crucial to hear from her to get a clearer picture and potentially identify inconsistencies that may indicate a Werewolf.
> **Radu:** Semira, you still haven't shared your role with us, and that's making me a bit suspicious. Why so quiet?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** If Radu is lying about seeing the Minion card in the center, he could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to throw us off. Pressing him for more details might reveal inconsistencies in his story or force him to come up with more explanations, which could expose his true role.
> **Semira:** Radu, your claim of seeing both a Mason and a Minion in the center seems suspicious to me. Dracula has backed up the Mason claim, but the Minion part feels off. Are you sure you're not trying to mislead us?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira's reluctance to disclose her role is a red flag, especially when we have some alignment between Dracula's claim and my findings. Pressing her might reveal inconsistencies or force her to make a claim that we can scrutinize further.
> **Radu:** Alright, Semira, you've been very hesitant to share your role, which makes me suspicious of you. Are you a Werewolf?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's claim is the most controversial right now, and clarifying it can help us identify potential Werewolves or Minions. Since Dracula validates part of Radu's claim, we need to dig deeper to see if there's any inconsistency.
> **Semira:** Alright, everyone, let's make sure we're covering all our bases. We need to understand why Radu saw both a Mason and a Minion in the center while Dracula claims to be a Mason. If Radu is lying, he could be a Werewolf or Minion. But if he's telling the truth, we have to consider the Minion isn't among us. We need more clarity on this situation.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Seer and providing specific information about a center card, I aim to build credibility and redirect suspicion away from myself. This also creates a narrative that aligns with the fact that I know there is no Seer in the game, making it harder for others to counterclaim effectively.
> **Emil:** Everyone, I think it's crucial that we gather as much information as possible right now. Let me start by saying that I'm the Seer, and last night I checked one of the center cards. I saw the Drunk card in the center. This means we have a Drunk among us who doesn't know their new role yet. So, let's be cautious about claims and try to piece together the roles based on this information.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's claim of being the Seer and seeing the Drunk card in the center is crucial, but it contradicts the idea of a Drunk player among us. We need to clarify this to narrow down the possible roles and identify the Werewolves.
> **Semira:** Emil, you claim to be the Seer and saw the Drunk card in the center. This is new and important information. But if the Drunk card is in the center, then the Drunk can't be among us. Can you explain why you believe the Drunk card is relevant? We need to get to the bottom of this.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to create confusion and redirect suspicion away from myself by emphasizing the inconsistencies in other players' claims. This will make it harder for others to focus on me while they debate and scrutinize each other's statements.
> **Emil:** Alright, here's something important to consider. If I'm the Seer and I saw the Drunk card in the center, it means no one among us is the Drunk. Radu claims to have seen a Mason and a Minion in the center, while Dracula claims to be a Mason. The only roles left unaccounted for are Villagers and the Werewolf. If Michael and Semira are both Villagers, which they have yet to claim, it doesn't add up. We need to focus on the inconsistencies in claims and the likelihood of deception. Let's piece this puzzle together.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Given the information from Emil and Dracula, Radu's claim seems consistent so far. However, Semira has been avoiding revealing her role, which could indicate she's hiding something. It's important to push for her role to gather more information.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, let's get this straight. Emil claims to be the Seer and saw the Drunk card in the center. Dracula claims to be a Mason, which aligns with Radu seeing a Mason card in the center. But Radu also claims to have seen the Minion card in the center. If this is true, then we need to focus on the remaining roles. Semira, you've been very quiet about your role, and that's suspicious to me.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira's reluctance to disclose her role is highly suspicious. It seems like she might be the Werewolf, trying to deflect suspicion by questioning others. Pressing her might force her to make a claim that we can scrutinize further.
> **Radu:** Semira, you've been very hesitant to share your role and have been quick to cast doubt on others without providing any useful information yourself. Are you the Werewolf?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's claim directly contradicts Radu's, which is crucial for identifying potential Werewolves. Clarifying Emil's reasoning can help us understand if he is lying or telling the truth.
> **Semira:** Emil, you claim to be the Seer and saw the Drunk card in the center. But Radu says he saw a Mason and a Minion in the center. Something doesn't add up. Can you explain more about why you believe the Drunk card is relevant? We need to clarify this.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Semira's vagueness and deflection tactics make her a prime suspect. By directly questioning her, I can put her on the spot and potentially make her slip up, increasing suspicion on her instead of me.
> **Emil:** Semira, you've been very hesitant to reveal your role and have mostly been casting doubt on others without providing solid information yourself. I'm starting to feel like you're trying to divert attention away from yourself. Are you the Werewolf?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Clarifying Dracula's Mason interaction can help verify his role and assess Radu's claim. If Dracula saw another Mason, it contradicts Radu's statement, which could expose Radu as a liar or a Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Dracula, you claimed to be a Mason, which aligns with what Radu saw in the center. But something is off. If Radu saw the Mason and Minion in the center, why is he so confident in his claim? Dracula, can you provide more details about last night's Mason interaction? Did you see another Mason or not?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira has been quiet about her role and has only been casting doubt on others, making her seem suspicious. We need to press her for more information to see if she's hiding something important.
> **Dracula:** Semira, you've been very hesitant to share your role and have mostly been casting doubt on others without providing solid information yourself. This makes me very suspicious of you. Are you the Werewolf?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** The conflicting statements between Emil and Radu are crucial. If we can expose who is lying, we can identify the Werewolf or Minion among us. Let's press on these points to get more clarity.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's focus on the contradictions here. Radu claims to have seen a Mason and a Minion in the center, while Emil claims to have seen the Drunk card as the Seer. These can't both be true. We need to dig deeper into these claims to figure out who's lying.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira has not provided any useful information and has only been trying to cast doubt on others. This behavior makes her look very suspicious, especially since the rest of us have been sharing our roles and observations. It's time to focus our attention on her and see if she's hiding something.
> **Dracula:** Alright, listen up everyone! Semira has been way too quiet and seems to be deflecting and casting doubt without giving us any solid information. Given everything we've heard, I think she's the most suspicious. We need to be careful, but I'm starting to believe Semira might be the Werewolf here.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Semira's vagueness and deflection tactics make her a prime suspect. By directly questioning her, I can put her on the spot and potentially make her slip up, increasing suspicion on her instead of me.
> **Emil:** Semira, you've been very hesitant to reveal your role and have mostly been casting doubt on others without providing solid information yourself. I'm starting to feel like you're trying to divert attention away from yourself. Are you the Werewolf?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** If Dracula saw another Mason, it contradicts Radu's claim of seeing both a Mason and Minion in the center. This could expose Radu as a liar or Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Dracula, let's clarify your Mason interaction. You claimed to be a Mason, which aligns with Radu's claim of seeing a Mason in the center. Did you see another Mason last night or not?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's claim of seeing both a Mason and a Minion in the center is suspicious because it directly contradicts Emil's claim of seeing the Drunk card in the center as the Seer. Since both claims cannot be true simultaneously and Radu's statement seems to be inconsistent with the information provided by others, I believe Radu might be trying to mislead us. Therefore, I suspect Radu to be the Werewolf or Minion, and I am voting for him.
> **Semira [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has been very hesitant to reveal her role and has mostly been casting doubt on others without providing solid information herself. This makes her the most suspicious candidate as the Werewolf. Additionally, Radu's and Dracula's stories align, and Emil's claim as the Seer offers further consistency. Semira's evasiveness and lack of concrete claims lead me to believe she might be the Werewolf.
> **Michael [Villager]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira has been very hesitant to share her role and has mostly been casting doubt on others without providing solid information herself. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with that of a Werewolf trying to deflect attention. Additionally, the claims made by Emil and myself align with the roles seen in the center, adding credibility to our information. Semira's reluctance to contribute constructively and her insistence on questioning others without revealing her own role makes her the most likely candidate for the Werewolf.
> **Radu [Seer]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira has been suspiciously quiet and deflecting throughout the discussion. She hasn't provided any useful information or claimed a role, making her behavior align with that of a Werewolf trying to avoid detection. Additionally, since we have conflicting claims from Radu and Emil about the center cards, focusing on Semira, who hasn't clarified her role, seems the most logical choice to uncover the Werewolf.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Semira has been the most hesitant to reveal her role and has consistently deflected questions without providing solid information. This behavior is highly suspicious, and the consensus seems to align with suspecting her. By voting for Semira, I increase the likelihood of avoiding suspicion on myself and potentially convincing others to vote for her as well, which aligns with my goal of winning as the Werewolf.
> **Emil [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Semira.


The votes were:
* Semira : Villager : 4
* Radu : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Semira was killed. The werewolves win.
