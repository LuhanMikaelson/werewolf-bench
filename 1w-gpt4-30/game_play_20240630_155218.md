## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Dracula. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Emil is a minion and is aware that Dracula is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Vladimir. They are thinking about their action.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gain information about roles that are not in play, which can help narrow down the possibilities for identifying Werewolves or other roles among the players. This broader information can be shared with the group to help guide discussions during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing that the two Mason cards are in the center, I provide valuable information to the village team, as we now know that there are no Masons among the players. This can help us narrow down who might be the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, let's get things started. I looked at two cards in the center last night, and they were both Masons.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm trying to clarify the information Vladimir provided about the Masons to see if anyone contradicts or supports it. Understanding the actions of the Masons can help narrow down the roles of other players.
> **Alexia:** Okay, Vladimir, you said you saw two Mason cards in the center. That means the two Masons are out of play.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to gather as much information as possible from the other players to piece together any inconsistencies or lies. Since I've already given my information about the two Masons being in the center, it's useful to start getting others to reveal their roles or provide details about their night actions.
> **Vladimir:** Dragos, what role did you have last night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Vladimir's claim effectively rules out two potential allies, we need to verify whether anyone else might contradict this claim. If Dracula also claims to be a Mason or something else, it can help us determine if Vladimir is lying or not.
> **Dragos:** If Vladimir claims to have seen two Mason cards in the center, then that means the two Masons are out of play. But we need to confirm this. Dracula, what role did you have last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Since Vladimir claimed to see two Masons in the center, and I know that one of the center cards is the Drunk, this could make Vladimir's claim suspicious. By declaring myself as the Seer and providing different information about the center cards, I can create doubt about whether Vladimir is telling the truth. This could cast suspicion on him and shift potential blame away from me.
> **Dracula:** I'm actually the Seer, and I checked one of the center cards. I saw the Drunk card there.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** If Dracula is telling the truth about seeing the Drunk card, then Vladimir’s claim of seeing two Masons is false. This discrepancy could help us identify a Werewolf or a Minion lying to mislead us.
> **Dragos:** Dracula, are you sure you saw the Drunk card in the center? That contradicts Vladimir's claim of seeing two Masons.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By challenging Vladimir's claim, I can create doubt around him and divert suspicion away from myself. This strategy helps to sow confusion and makes it harder for the others to pinpoint me as the Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Vladimir, your claim about seeing two Mason cards in the center seems questionable to me. I saw the Drunk card in the center, which means your statement doesn't add up. Are you trying to mislead us?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** If Emil can provide additional information or verify someone else's statement, it could help us identify inconsistencies and potentially expose any Werewolves or the Minion. Dracula's claim directly contradicts my information, so I need to gather more details to determine the truth.
> **Vladimir:** I'm very sure about what I saw. Two Mason cards in the center. Dracula, if you're claiming to be the Seer and saw the Drunk in the center, then something doesn't add up. Either you're mistaken, or you're trying to mislead us. So, Emil, what did you see or do last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** We need to get to the bottom of this contradiction between Vladmir and Dracula. By pushing Dragos to reveal his role, we can narrow down the possibilities and create more confusion among the village team, which is beneficial for us as the Minion.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone, let's think this through. Vladmir, you claim to have seen two Masons in the center, but Dracula says he saw the Drunk card there. This is definitely contradictory information. One of you is lying. If there are indeed two Mason cards in the center, that means Dragos should be able to tell us his role to further narrow things down. Dragos, can you clarify what role you had last night?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information to determine the truth between Vladimir and Dracula's conflicting claims. Emil hasn't revealed his role yet, and knowing his role can help us piece together the puzzle.
> **Dragos:** Emil, based on the facts, we have two conflicting claims: Vladimir says he saw two Masons in the center, and Dracula says he saw the Drunk card in the center. Given this discrepancy, we need more information to deduce who is lying. Emil, what role did you have last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By bringing Alexia into the conversation, we can gather more information and potentially create further confusion among the village team. This helps us as the Minion to protect Dracula, the Werewolf, by steering attention elsewhere.
> **Emil:** Alright, let's figure this out together. From what I'm hearing, we have conflicting statements about the center cards. Vladimir says he saw two Masons, and Dracula claims to have seen the Drunk. If both of these statements are true, then Dragos and Alexia should be able to help us clarify things. Dragos already seems skeptical, so Alexia, what role did you have last night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to address the conflicting information. If Dracula is lying, he might be a Werewolf trying to create confusion, and this needs to be clarified quickly.
> **Alexia:** Dracula, your claim about seeing the Drunk card in the center contradicts Vladimir's claim of seeing two Masons. Why should we believe you over Vladimir?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking Alexia directly for her role, we can gather more information to determine the credibility of Vladimir's and my claims. This step is crucial to clarify the situation and potentially cast suspicion on someone else.
> **Dracula:** Alexia, given the conflicting claims between Vladimir and myself, can you tell us what role you had last night? Your information might help us resolve this discrepancy.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim contradicts Vladimir's, and if Dracula is lying, he might be a Werewolf. Pointing this out could pressure him to reveal more information or slip up.
> **Alexia:** Dracula, I'm having a hard time believing your claim about seeing the Drunk card in the center. If you're the Seer, you should have seen two cards from the center, not one. That makes me think you're trying to mislead us.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Alexia's doubts directly and explaining my choice as the Seer, I can reinforce my claim and cast further doubt on Vladimir's statement. This strategy aims to shift suspicion onto Vladimir and away from myself, improving my chances of survival as the only Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Alexia, I understand your skepticism, but there's a reason I only checked one card. As the Seer, I chose to look at just one card in the center instead of two to get precise information. And I saw the Drunk card there. Vladimir's claim of seeing two Masons seems off to me.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** With contradictory claims from Vladimir and Dracula, it's critical to dig deeper into their stories. If one of them is lying, identifying Dracula's potential role might help us uncover a Werewolf.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, given the conflicting information between Vladimir and Dracula, I think we should scrutinize their claims more closely. Vladimir, if you saw two Masons in the center, who do you think Dracula might be if he's lying?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** With Alexia expressing skepticism about both Vladimir's and my claims, learning about her role might add another layer of information to help us determine the truth. By directing the question to Alexia, I can gather more intel and potentially shift the focus away from myself.
> **Dracula:** Alexia, I'm curious about your role last night since you seem to have doubts about both Vladimir's and my claims. Can you share what role you played? This might help us clarify who might be lying here.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** This is a critical contradiction that needs to be addressed. By pressing Dracula further, we might be able to determine if he's lying and potentially identify him as a Werewolf.
> **Alexia:** Dracula, your claim doesn't add up with Vladimir's. If you're the Seer and saw the Drunk card in the center, that directly contradicts Vladimir's claim of seeing two Masons. Why should we believe you over Vladimir?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By presenting my argument in a logical manner and questioning Vladimir's claim, I can cast further doubt on his statement. This reinforces my claim and makes it seem more plausible, potentially shifting suspicion onto Vladimir and away from myself.
> **Dracula:** Everyone, let's take a step back and consider this logically. If Vladimir is claiming to be the Seer and saw two Mason cards in the center, and I am also claiming to be the Seer and saw the Drunk card in the center, there's a clear contradiction here. One of us is definitely lying. Now, if I were lying, why would I choose such a specific card like the Drunk? It would be risky for me to make such a claim if it could easily be disproven. So, Vladimir, if you are indeed the Seer, you should be ready to explain why you saw two Masons, which contradicts my information.


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By addressing the core contradiction, we can focus the attention on the conflicting claims between Vladimir and Dracula. This will create confusion among the village team and divert attention away from Dracula, who is our Werewolf. As a Minion, it's crucial to protect our Werewolf by sowing doubt and steering the conversation in a way that benefits us.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone, let's get one thing clear. We have a major contradiction between Vladimir and Dracula. Vladimir claims to have seen two Masons in the center, while Dracula says he saw the Drunk card there. Given this discrepancy, we need to dig deeper. If Vladimir is telling the truth, then both Mason cards are out of play, and Dracula is lying. But if Dracula is telling the truth, then we need to question why Vladimir would make such a bold and easily refutable claim.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know the mechanics of the role. Dracula's explanation of seeing just one card in the center contradicts the Seer's abilities, making his claim highly suspicious. This helps me build a case against Dracula possibly being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Dracula, your claim has a major flaw. As the Seer, you should have looked at either one player card or two center cards, not just one center card. This inconsistency makes me think you're lying.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking Alexia directly about her role, I can gather more information and potentially shift the focus away from myself. If she hesitates or provides suspicious information, it could cast doubt on her instead.
> **Dracula:** Alexia, you seem quite skeptical of my claim, but you haven't shared your role yet. If we're going to resolve this, we need to hear from everyone. Can you tell us what role you had last night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm trying to catch Dracula in a lie because his behavior and claims don't align with the usual actions of the Seer. If he slips up or gives an inconsistent explanation, it might expose him as a Werewolf.
> **Alexia:** Dracula, your claim that you saw the Drunk card in the center when you only looked at one card is really suspicious to me. If you were the Seer, you would have looked at two cards, not one. Why didn't you follow the Seer’s usual action?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil has been very active in questioning others but hasn't provided any information about his own role. By asking him directly, I can gather more information and potentially shift the focus away from myself. If he hesitates or provides suspicious information, it could cast doubt on him instead.
> **Dracula:** Emil, I notice you've been asking questions and summarizing a lot, but you haven't really shared what role you had last night. Can you tell us what role you played?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Alexia to reveal her role, we can gather more information to further create confusion and divert attention away from Dracula. This helps us as the Minion to protect the Werewolf and steer the conversation in a way that benefits our team.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone, there's clearly a significant contradiction between Vladimir and Dracula's claims. We need to figure out who is lying. Given the information so far, I think it's worth considering that one of them might be trying to divert attention away from themselves. Vladimir, if you're so sure about the two Masons in the center, can you explain why Dracula would claim to see the Drunk card? This discrepancy needs to be resolved because one of you is obviously not telling the truth. Alexia, you've been quiet about your role. Please share what role you had last night to help us clarify these conflicting statements.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's explanation doesn't fit the usual behavior of the Seer. If he is lying, he could be a Werewolf trying to create confusion. Pressing him on this inconsistency might reveal more about his actual role.
> **Alexia:** Dracula, your claim is really suspicious to me. As the Seer, you should have looked at either one player card or two center cards, not just one center card. Why didn't you follow the Seer’s usual action?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Alexia has been questioning my claim repeatedly, but she hasn't disclosed her own role. By directing the question to her, I aim to gather more information and potentially shift suspicion away from myself. If she hesitates or provides suspicious details, it could cast doubt on her and divert attention from me as the Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Alexia, you seem really focused on me and Vladimir. It's interesting that you haven't shared any specific information about your own role. If we're going to resolve this, we need full transparency from everyone. Can you please tell us what role you had last night?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim about only checking one center card as the Seer doesn't align with the Seer's usual action of either checking one player's card or two center cards. This inconsistency makes me suspect Dracula is trying to mislead us and might be a Werewolf.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, we have a clear contradiction between Vladimir and Dracula, and one of them is definitely lying. Dracula, if you were the Seer, you would have looked at either one player card or two center cards, not just one center card. This makes me think you are lying, and might be a Werewolf.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil has been actively trying to summarize and guide the discussion, which makes me suspect he might be trying to avoid drawing attention to his own role. We need to know what his role was to get a clearer picture of the situation.
> **Alexia:** Emil, you've been summarizing and facilitating a lot, but you haven't shared your role. What did you do last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Alexia to reveal her role, we can gather more information to further create confusion and divert attention away from Dracula. This helps us as the Minion to protect the Werewolf and steer the conversation in a way that benefits our team. Additionally, Alexia seems to be the most skeptical and vocal, so targeting her may help us gauge more reactions from other players.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, let's think this through logically. We have two conflicting statements: Vladimir claims he saw two Masons in the center, and Dracula claims he saw the Drunk card there. Given this contradiction, one of them is clearly trying to mislead us. If Vladimir saw two Masons, then Dracula's claim is false, and vice versa. We need more information to get to the bottom of this. Alexia, you seem pretty skeptical of Dracula and Vladimir. Please share what role you had last night to help us clarify these conflicting statements.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know that I saw two Mason cards in the center. Dracula's claim to be the Seer and having seen the Drunk card in the center is inconsistent with the Seer's ability to look at either one player card or two center cards. This discrepancy makes me highly suspicious of Dracula being a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Vladimir [Seer]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim about seeing the Drunk card in the center contradicts Vladimir's claim of seeing two Masons. Furthermore, Dracula's explanation doesn't fit the usual behavior of the Seer, as the Seer should have either looked at one player's card or two center cards, not just one. This inconsistency makes Dracula's claim highly suspicious, and it seems likely that he might be a Werewolf trying to create confusion.
> **Alexia [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's claim of seeing two Masons in the center is contradicted by Dracula's claim of seeing the Drunk card in the center. Dracula's explanation of why he only looked at one card is plausible, while Vladimir's claim of seeing two specific cards seems more suspicious and harder to believe. Additionally, Alexia and Emil have not provided any substantial claims to further verify or contradict the center cards. Therefore, I believe Vladimir is more likely to be lying and potentially a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Vladimir's claim of seeing two Masons in the center contradicts my claim of seeing the Drunk card in the center. Given that I am the only Werewolf and know the Drunk card is indeed in the center, Vladimir must be lying. By voting for Vladimir, I can align myself with the rest of the village who might also be suspicious of him due to the conflicting statements. This increases the chance of diverting suspicion away from myself and ensuring someone else gets voted out.
> **Dracula [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** Given the major contradiction between Vladimir and Dracula, it's clear that one of them is lying. Vladimir's claim of seeing two Mason cards in the center is more suspicious, particularly because the Seer, Dracula, has provided a more detailed defense. By voting for Vladimir, it increases the chances of causing doubt and potentially pushing the village team to make a misstep, which helps protect the Werewolf. Additionally, with Alexia and Dragos questioning Vladimir's claim, it seems likely they might vote for him too.
> **Emil [Minion]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


The votes were:
* Vladimir : Seer : 3
* Dracula : Werewolf : 2



>***GAME:*** Vladimir was killed. The werewolves win.
