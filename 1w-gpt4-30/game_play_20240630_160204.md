>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to gather as much information as possible to identify potential Werewolves. Cristina's silence might be a strategy to avoid suspicion, so it’s important to hear from her early on to gauge her responses and see if there are any inconsistencies.
> **Michael:** Cristina, you’ve been pretty quiet so far. What role were you dealt?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael questioned me first, so it’s only fair to turn the question back to him to get more information. As a Villager, I need to start gathering as much information as possible to identify the Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Michael, I'm a Villager. What about you? What role were you dealt?


***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** By asking Marius about his role, I can gather more information and potentially catch any inconsistencies in the claims. This will help us narrow down the Werewolves.
> **Michael:** Cristina, it's interesting that you claim to be a Villager too. There are three Villagers in this game, so it's plausible. However, I'd like to know more about the roles in the game. Marius, what role were you dealt?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to gather more information from all players, and Alexia hasn't contributed yet. It's important to see if her role claim aligns with what we know.
> **Marius:** Alexia, you've been very quiet as well. What role were you dealt?


***Alexia (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius deflected the question to me without providing any information about his own role. This is suspicious behavior and needs to be addressed.
> **Alexia:** I find it interesting that Marius hasn't mentioned what role he was dealt yet. Marius, what role did you get?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to gather information from all players to make a better judgment. Alexia hasn't contributed yet, and knowing her role could help us identify inconsistencies that may point us to the Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Alright, everyone, we need to get to the bottom of this. Michael, Alexia, and Cristina have all claimed their roles. Since there are multiple Villagers, it's possible they are telling the truth, but we still need more information. Alexia, you still haven't revealed your role. What were you dealt?
