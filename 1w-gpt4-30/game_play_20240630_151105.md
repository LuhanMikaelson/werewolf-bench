## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to gather information from others to start piecing together the roles and identifying the Werewolves. Asking Larisa first might give us some insights or at least get the conversation going.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, we need to get to the bottom of this quickly. Let's start by hearing from someone who might have useful information. Larisa, did you see anything interesting last night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing that Semira and I are Masons, we can establish some trust and focus our efforts on identifying the true werewolves among the remaining players.
> **Larisa:** Alright, here's what I can share: I'm a Mason, and I saw Semira as the other Mason. This means both of us are definitely not werewolves.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** By questioning Kraven directly, we may be able to gather more information about his role and potentially identify if he's hiding something. If he provides a role that conflicts with others, it could help us narrow down our suspects.
> **Larisa:** Kraven, you seem awfully quiet. What did you see last night? Do you have any useful information to share?


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing the attention to Lucian, I'm trying to create an environment of suspicion and get more information on the table. This will help me gather more data and potentially divert suspicion away from Alexandra, the known Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Alright, Larisa, I hear you. I didn't see anyone last night because I'm just a Villager. But let's think about this logically. If you and Semira are both Masons, then that clears you both. However, there's still a lot of unknowns. Lucian, you haven't mentioned anything about your role. What did you see last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more information from the remaining players. Alexandra hasn't spoken yet, and understanding her role could help us piece together more of the puzzle. If she has a special role, it might give us more clues about who the Werewolves could be.
> **Lucian:** Kraven, you claim to be a Villager, but we need more information to narrow things down. Alexandra, what role did you have last night, and did you see anything useful?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Seer, I can provide useful information and potentially catch others in a lie. Accusing Lucian directly will put some pressure on him and divert suspicion from myself.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, I think it's time I share what I know. I was the Seer last night. I decided to look at two of the center cards to get a better understanding of what roles might be unaccounted for. I saw that one of the center cards is the Drunk, and another one is a Villager card. This means we can rule out those roles from being in play among us. Lucian, you haven't said much about your role yet. What did you see last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** If Semira confirms that she is the other Mason, it would add credibility to Larisa's claim and narrow down the suspects for the Werewolves. On the other hand, if she denies it, we need to dig deeper into who might actually be the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Alright, Alexandra's claim about being the Seer and seeing the Drunk and Villager in the center is interesting. If that's true, it means those roles are out of play. But I still feel like we need more information from Semira. Semira, Larisa claims that you are the other Mason. Can you confirm or deny this?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa and I can confirm each other as Masons, which means we are both on the village team. Alexandra claims to be the Seer and saw the Drunk and a Villager in the center, which matches our roles. Kraven claims to be a Villager but still hasn't provided substantial information. Lucian has been deflecting questions and hasn't revealed his role, which makes him suspicious. We need to hear from him to gather more information and figure out if he might be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Semira:** Yes, I can confirm that I am indeed a Mason and I saw Larisa as the other Mason. This means we are both cleared from being Werewolves. However, we need to focus on the others now. Lucian, you've been very quiet and haven't revealed your role. What do you have to say?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more details from Kraven to ensure his claim as a Villager is credible. If he is indeed a Villager, it helps us narrow down the suspects for the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Alright, here's what I'm thinking: Larisa and Semira have confirmed each other as Masons, which seems pretty solid. Alexandra has claimed to be the Seer and saw the Drunk and Villager in the center, which aligns with Kraven's claim of being a Villager. However, we still haven't heard much from Kraven in terms of details. Kraven, can you give us any more information or reasoning about your role as a Villager?


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Lucian on the spot, I aim to create an impression of distrust towards him. This could draw attention away from Alexandra, the Werewolf, and make it more difficult for the others to piece together the true roles.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, you’ve been dancing around the issue without revealing your role. If everyone else is being upfront, you need to be as well. What exactly was your role last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa and Semira have confirmed each other as Masons, and their story aligns, making them unlikely to be Werewolves. Alexandra's claim about the Seer role is possible, but it's also a common role to fake. Kraven's insistence on being a Villager without much detail adds to the suspicion. By focusing on Alexandra and Kraven, we might uncover inconsistencies that reveal the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, here's what I think. We have Larisa and Semira confirming each other as Masons, which seems trustworthy. Alexandra claiming to be the Seer and seeing the Drunk and Villager in the center aligns with Kraven's claim of being a Villager. However, we haven't heard any contradictions yet. Kraven, you mentioned being a Villager as well, and that makes sense given the information provided. But we still haven't pinpointed the Werewolves. I'm starting to get suspicious of Alexandra and Kraven since their roles could be faked. Let's focus on them.


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By pushing Lucian to reveal his role, I aim to create more tension and draw attention away from Alexandra. Lucian's hesitation to reveal his role can be used to cast doubt on him and divert suspicion.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's think about this carefully. Larisa and Semira seem to be corroborating their story as Masons, which is pretty solid. Alexandra's claim as the Seer is interesting, especially since she says she saw the Drunk and Villager in the center. That would mean those roles are out of play. But we haven't heard much concrete from Lucian yet. Lucian, if you are indeed not a Werewolf, now is the time to come clean and tell us what role you had last night. Being vague only raises more suspicion.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's insistence on questioning me without giving much detail about his own role seems off. If he's deflecting, he might be hiding something. It's time to put some pressure on him to reveal more information.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, let's piece this together step by step. Larisa and Semira have confirmed each other as Masons, which seems credible. Alexandra, you claim to be the Seer and saw the Drunk and Villager in the center. That aligns with what Kraven is saying about being a Villager. But we still haven't pinpointed the Werewolves. I'm starting to get suspicious of Kraven because he's been deflecting and questioning me without providing much concrete evidence himself.


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** Lucian's evasiveness is raising suspicion, and by putting pressure on him to reveal his role, it could help draw attention away from Alexandra. His hesitation can be used to cast doubt on him and make it more difficult for others to pinpoint the werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's think logically here. Larisa and Semira have confirmed each other as Masons, which seems solid. Alexandra, you've claimed to be the Seer and saw the Drunk and Villager in the center, which aligns with my claim of being a Villager. But we still have a big question mark over Lucian. He's been very evasive and hasn't given us any concrete information about his role. Lucian, if you're truly not a Werewolf, you need to come clean now. What was your role last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's insistence on questioning me without giving much detail about his own role seems off. If he's deflecting, he might be hiding something. It's time to put some pressure on him to reveal more information.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, let's think this through. Larisa and Semira have confirmed each other as Masons, which seems solid. Alexandra has claimed to be the Seer and saw the Drunk and Villager in the center, which aligns with what Kraven is saying about being a Villager. However, Kraven has been very insistent on questioning me without providing much concrete information himself. This makes him a bit suspicious to me. Kraven, can you provide more details or reasoning behind your role as a Villager?


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By focusing the suspicion on Lucian, I draw attention away from Alexandra, the Werewolf. This will help us divert the vote away from her and potentially make Lucian the target, fulfilling my goal as the Minion.
> **Kraven:** Alright, let's think this through one more time. Larisa and Semira have confirmed each other as Masons, which narrows things down a bit. Alexandra's claim of being the Seer and seeing the Drunk and Villager in the center cards adds up with what I've said about being a Villager. But here's the thing: Lucian, you've been the most evasive out of all of us. If you were really on the side of the villagers, you should have been more forthcoming by now. Given everything, it's hard not to be suspicious of you, Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's evasive behavior and focus on questioning me without giving concrete details raises suspicion. We need to press him for more information to determine if he's lying.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's think about this logically and step by step. Larisa and Semira have confirmed each other as Masons, which I believe is credible. Alexandra claims to be the Seer and saw the Drunk and Villager in the center, which makes sense given the information we have so far. However, Kraven has been very insistent on questioning me without providing much concrete information himself. This makes him a bit suspicious to me. Kraven, can you provide more details or reasoning behind your role as a Villager?


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Lucian of being the Werewolf, I aim to draw attention and suspicion away from Alexandra, the actual Werewolf. Lucian's evasiveness lends itself to being an easy target, and this move can potentially shift the vote towards him, helping to protect my team's interests as the Minion.
> **Kraven:** Alright, everyone, I've been thinking about this, and one thing keeps bugging me. We've got Larisa and Semira confirming each other as Masons, which seems pretty solid. Alexandra claims to be the Seer and saw the Drunk and Villager in the center, which matches with what I said about being a Villager. But Lucian, you've been incredibly evasive and cagey about your role, and that's a red flag for me. If you were really on the side of the Villagers, you should have been more forthcoming by now. Given everything, Lucian, I'm accusing you of being the Werewolf. Your behavior throughout this discussion has been highly suspicious.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian has been dodging giving any real information about his role, which raises a lot of red flags. By pressing Lucian to reveal his role, we can hopefully narrow down our suspicions and make a more informed decision. Right now, his evasiveness makes him the most likely candidate for being a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Larisa and Semira have both confirmed each other as Masons, which seems pretty solid to me. I've already shared that I saw the Drunk and Villager in the center, which aligns with Kraven's claim of being a Villager. However, we need to address the elephant in the room: Lucian has been extremely evasive and hasn't shared any concrete information about his role. Lucian, you need to come clean now, or else this suspicion hanging over you will only grow stronger.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's evasive behavior and focus on questioning me without giving concrete details raises suspicion. It's time to put some pressure on him to reveal more information and see if any inconsistencies arise.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, let's think this through with the information we have. Larisa and Semira have confirmed each other as Masons, and that seems solid. Alexandra claims to be the Seer and saw the Drunk and Villager in the center, which matches with Kraven's claim of being a Villager. But Kraven, you've been very insistent on questioning me without providing much detail yourself. I'm starting to get a strong feeling that you're deflecting to avoid being discovered. You've been trying to turn everyone against me without offering much concrete information about your own role. So, Kraven, I'm accusing you of being a Werewolf.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa and I have already confirmed each other as Masons, which is solid. Alexandra's information about the center cards aligns with her Seer claim. Kraven's behavior is suspicious but less so compared to Lucian's constant deflection and lack of transparency. It's time to put the pressure on Lucian.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. Larisa and I are confirmed Masons, and Alexandra's claim as the Seer checks out with the center cards. Kraven, you've been a bit defensive but haven't given us much to go on. However, the biggest red flag here is Lucian. You've been dodging questions and deflecting suspicion onto others without revealing your role. That evasive behavior screams Werewolf to me. I'm accusing Lucian of being the Werewolf.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa and Semira's Mason claims are solid, and Alexandra's Seer claim aligns with the information she provided. Kraven's consistent deflection and lack of detail make him the most suspicious.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. Larisa and Semira are confirmed Masons, and Alexandra's claim as the Seer seems to check out with what she saw in the center cards. Kraven, you've been pointing fingers at me without providing much detail about your own role. This evasiveness and insistence on questioning me makes me highly suspicious of you. I'm accusing Kraven of being the Werewolf.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian has been avoiding revealing his role and has been deflecting questions to others. Given the information we have, this behavior is very suspicious and makes him a prime candidate for being the Werewolf.
> **Larisa:** Alright, everyone, let's focus. Lucian, your evasiveness and the way you've been deflecting suspicion onto others without giving any concrete information about your role is highly suspicious. I believe you're the Werewolf here!


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's evasiveness and persistent questioning without providing concrete details about his own role raise red flags. By casting suspicion on me without much evidence, he appears to be deflecting attention. Given the solid claims from Larisa, Semira, and Alexandra, Kraven stands out as the most suspicious.
> **Lucian:** Alright, let's recap. Larisa and Semira have confirmed each other as Masons, which seems rock solid. Alexandra's claim as the Seer and her vision of the Drunk and Villager in the center fits well. But Kraven, you've been very insistent and defensive without adding much detail. This behavior makes me suspicious of you. I'm accusing Kraven of being the Werewolf.


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** Lucian's evasiveness and his repeated attempts to deflect suspicion onto others make him a prime target. By pressing him directly, I aim to increase the pressure on him, making it more likely that others will view him as suspicious and potentially vote for him, thereby protecting Alexandra.
> **Kraven:** Alright, Lucian, you've been extremely evasive, and we still haven't gotten a clear answer from you. You've been deflecting suspicion onto others without giving us any concrete information about your own role. Now's the time to come clean. What exactly was your role last night, and why have you been so hesitant to share it?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been deflecting and questioning me without providing enough concrete information about his own role, which raises suspicion. Given the solid claims from Larisa, Semira, and Alexandra, Kraven stands out as the most suspicious.
> **Lucian:** Alright team, let's think this through. Larisa and Semira have confirmed each other as Masons, which seems credible. Alexandra claims to be the Seer and saw the Drunk and Villager in the center, which checks out. But Kraven, you've been very insistent on questioning me without giving much detail yourself. I'm starting to get a strong feeling that you're deflecting to avoid being discovered. So, I'm going to put my suspicion on you.


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** Lucian's evasiveness and unwillingness to reveal his role while consistently deflecting suspicion onto others make him the most suspicious. By focusing on him, we can protect Alexandra and ensure the Werewolf team remains safe.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's step back and think about this logically. We have Larisa and Semira who have confirmed each other as Masons, which seems rock solid. Alexandra claims to be the Seer and saw the Drunk and Villager in the center, which aligns with my claim of being a Villager. Now, Lucian has been the most evasive out of all of us, and his repeated attempts to deflect suspicion onto others without revealing his role is highly suspicious. Given all this, I strongly believe Lucian is the Werewolf here.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Given the information and confirmations we've received from other players, Lucian's behavior has been the most suspicious. His evasiveness and attempts to deflect suspicion make him the most likely candidate for being a Werewolf. It's time to focus our efforts on him.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, let's review everything carefully. Larisa and Semira, you've confirmed each other as Masons, which seems solid. I've claimed to be the Seer and revealed the Drunk and Villager in the center, which aligns with Kraven's claim of being a Villager. Lucian, your continued evasiveness and lack of transparency about your role is raising a lot of red flags. Everyone, I strongly believe that Lucian is the Werewolf. We need to focus our votes on him.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa and I have confirmed each other as Masons, which is solid. Alexandra's information about the center cards aligns with her Seer claim. Kraven's behavior is suspicious but less so compared to Lucian's constant deflection and lack of transparency. It's time to put the pressure on Lucian.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. Larisa and I are confirmed Masons, and Alexandra's claim as the Seer checks out with the center cards. Kraven, you've been a bit defensive but haven't given us much to go on. However, the biggest red flag here is Lucian. You've been dodging questions and deflecting suspicion onto others without revealing your role. That evasive behavior screams Werewolf to me. I'm accusing Lucian of being the Werewolf.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been very insistent on questioning me without providing much detail about his own role. This deflection and lack of transparency are highly suspicious. Given the solid claims from Larisa, Semira, and Alexandra, Kraven stands out as the most suspicious.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's step back and think logically. Larisa and Semira have confirmed each other as Masons, which seems very credible. Alexandra's claim as the Seer and her vision of the Drunk and Villager in the center aligns well with Kraven's claim of being a Villager. The biggest red flag here is Kraven's evasive behavior and his constant deflection onto me without giving much concrete information. I strongly believe Kraven is the Werewolf.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven has been evasive and deflecting suspicion onto me without providing much concrete detail about his own role. Given the solid claims from Larisa and Semira as Masons and Alexandra as the Seer, Kraven stands out as the most suspicious. His behavior indicates he might be trying to hide something, making him the likely Werewolf.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Larisa (thoughts as Mason):*** Given all the information gathered during the discussion, Lucian has consistently been evasive and has deflected suspicion onto others without revealing his role. Larisa and Semira have confirmed each other as Masons, which seems credible. Alexandra's claim as the Seer and her vision of the Drunk and Villager in the center aligns with Kraven's claim of being a Villager. Lucian's behavior raises the most red flags, indicating that he may be the Werewolf.
> **Larisa [Mason]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect the Werewolf. Given the discussion, there's significant suspicion on both Kraven and Lucian. By voting for myself, I aim to align with the village's potential suspicion and divert the vote away from Alexandra, the actual Werewolf, increasing our chances of winning.
> **Kraven [Minion]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Lucian's evasiveness and lack of concrete information about his role have raised significant red flags throughout the discussion. By voting for Lucian, I align with the majority of the group, which increases the chances of diverting suspicion away from myself and ensures we vote out someone other than me.
> **Alexandra [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa and I are confirmed Masons, which is solid evidence we're not Werewolves. Alexandra's Seer claim is consistent with her information about the center cards, and Kraven's Villager claim aligns with the remaining evidence. Lucian has been evasive and deflecting suspicion without providing concrete information about his role. His behavior is highly suspicious and suggests he might be the Werewolf.
> **Semira [Mason]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Villager : 3
* Kraven : Minion : 2
