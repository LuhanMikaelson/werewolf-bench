## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Emil. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Selene is a minion and is aware that Emil is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Andrei. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Kraven. They are thinking about their action.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can get a better sense of which roles are not in play, thus narrowing down the possibilities for everyone else. This information will be crucial for the village team to identify the Werewolves.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I have information that confirms one of the center cards is a Mason. This will help us narrow down the roles and identify potential Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Alright, everyone. I'll start. I know that one of the Mason cards is in the middle because I didn't see another Mason last night.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Andrei mentioned that he didn't see another Mason, it aligns with my information that one of the Mason cards is indeed in the center. This means Andrei is likely telling the truth, and we can start narrowing down the potential Werewolves from other players.
> **Kraven:** I have some interesting information to share. I used my ability last night to look at two cards in the center. I found a Mason and a Villager card.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Seer and providing seemingly useful information that aligns with the other players' statements, I aim to blend in and avoid suspicion. This also helps in reinforcing the claim that one of the Villager cards is in the center, which can sow some seeds of doubt and confusion among the players.
> **Emil:** I have some information as well. Last night, I used my Seer ability and checked one of the center cards. I saw a Villager card.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Emil and Kraven, I can create confusion and misdirection. This will help protect Emil, who is a Werewolf, by making it less likely that the other players will focus on him. It also diverts attention from me as a potential Minion.
> **Selene:** Well, this is getting interesting! We already have claims about the Mason and center cards. But here's what I'm thinking—Emil and Kraven have both claimed to have looked at the center cards. But what if one of them is lying? What if there is a Werewolf pretending to be the Seer or the one who looked at the center cards? I think it's highly suspicious that both of them have overlapping information. Something doesn't add up.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to clear up the overlapping claims. If Emil is lying about being the Seer, he might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to blend in. This could expose a potential deception.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, this is getting quite tangled. Emil and Kraven both claim to have seen a Villager card in the center. But Andrei is saying one of the Mason cards is there too. If Andrei is telling the truth, that means there's only one more Villager card in the center, which matches what Kraven said. But that leaves Emil's claim suspicious to me. Emil, why did you only look at one card and not two as the Seer?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Vladimir's concern and then shifting the focus to questioning Selene directly, I aim to create a scenario where I come off as cooperative and transparent, reducing suspicion on myself. This also pivots the attention away from me and adds pressure on Selene to reveal her role, which can create more opportunities for uncovering inconsistencies.
> **Emil:** I understand where you're coming from, Vladimir. I chose to look at just one card in the center because I wanted to verify the information that I suspected might be there. If I had looked at two cards, it might have muddled my focus. But let's also consider this: Kraven claimed to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, which supports Andrei's claim. If you think about it, three of us are reinforcing each other's statements. To me, this sounds more like a coordinated effort to find the werewolf rather than deception. Selene, what role did you have and what did you do last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By confusing the other players with overlapping claims and questioning both Emil and Kraven, I aim to create doubt and make it challenging for them to identify the true Werewolf. This diversifies the focus and helps protect Emil as the Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, let's break this down. Andrei claims to be a Mason but didn't see another Mason. Kraven says he saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Emil says he saw a Villager in the center. If I'm honest, that makes Kraven's and Emil's claims a bit fishy because they both claim to have seen a Villager in the center, which could be a convenient cover. But here's another thought: if there are two Masons, one of which is in the center, it means Andrei's claim is truthful. In that case, there should only be one more Villager card in the center, aligning with Kraven, but leaving Emil's claim out. Now, why would Emil lie? Could he be trying to shift attention away from him? Kraven, can you explain more about why you chose to look at two cards and not one? Andrei, did you feel anything was off during your night phase?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know one of the Mason cards is in the center. Kraven's claim supports this, but Emil's single card claim contradicts the usual Seer behavior. This discrepancy makes Emil's claim suspicious and worth questioning.
> **Andrei:** Kraven, your claim seems to line up with my information about the Mason card being in the center, but Emil's claim feels off. Emil, why would you claim to see just one card when the Seer typically looks at two? That feels like a red flag to me.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By summarizing the current state of claims and highlighting the improbability of no Werewolf cards being in the center, I aim to create doubt about Kraven's claim as well as mine, making it harder for others to discern the truth. This confusion can help divert suspicion away from me.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and analyze the situation. We've got Andrei claiming to be a Mason who didn't see another Mason, which means one of the Mason cards is in the center. Kraven claims to have seen two center cards—one Mason and one Villager. I claimed to have seen one Villager card in the center. Now, if we're to believe all these claims, it means there are a Mason and two Villager cards in the center. But that would mean there are no Werewolf cards in the center, which seems unlikely. So, either Kraven or I must be lying.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Given the information we have, Andrei's and my information align well. However, Emil claims to be a Seer but only looked at one card, which is unusual for a Seer and raises suspicion. This could mean Emil is lying, possibly to cover up a Werewolf role.
> **Kraven:** Emil, your story doesn't completely add up to me. If you were the Seer, why would you only look at one center card when you had the opportunity to look at two? This is inconsistent with how the Seer should operate.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly addressing Selene's lack of a claim and pressing her for her role and actions, I can shift some of the focus and suspicion onto her. This can help create doubt and confusion among the players, making it less likely that they will focus on me.
> **Emil:** Selene, I find it highly suspicious that you haven't claimed any role or given any specific information about your night phase actions. In these games, it's easy for a Werewolf to sit back and let others argue while sowing doubt. What role did you have, and why haven't you shared any crucial information yet?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Emil and Kraven, I can create confusion and misdirection. This will help protect Emil, who is a Werewolf, by making it less likely that the other players will focus on him. It also diverts attention from me as a potential Minion.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and analyze this logically. We have Andrei claiming to be a Mason who didn't see another Mason, which means one of the Mason cards is in the center. Kraven claims to have seen two center cards—one Mason and one Villager. Emil claims to have seen one Villager card in the center. If we take all these claims at face value, it means there are a Mason and two Villager cards in the center. However, this would mean there are no Werewolf cards in the center, which seems unlikely. So, either Kraven or Emil must be lying. Additionally, Emil's claim of only looking at one card as a Seer is suspicious because the Seer typically looks at two cards. Kraven and Emil, your stories don't fully align, and this discrepancy needs to be addressed.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Kraven and pointing out the inconsistencies in his story, I aim to divert suspicion away from myself and create confusion among the players. This can help prevent them from focusing on me as the potential Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Alright, let's think about this carefully. Andrei claims to be a Mason who didn't see another Mason, so one Mason card is likely in the center. Kraven claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center. I claimed to have seen a Villager in the center. If all these are true, it means there are no Werewolf cards in the center, which seems unlikely. Given the situation, I think it's more plausible that Kraven is lying to throw us off. We need to focus on who else could be the Werewolf, and I think Kraven's story is the most suspicious.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Emil to explain the inconsistency in his claim, I'm further casting doubt on him while subtly aligning myself with Andrei and Kraven. This diversifies the focus and helps protect Emil, the Werewolf, by keeping the suspicion spread out.
> **Selene:** Okay, everyone, let's break this down one more time because we need to get our facts straight. We have conflicting information about the center cards, which means someone is definitely lying. Andrei, you've been consistent with your Mason claim, and Kraven's statement supports your claim about the Mason card in the center. This makes Kraven's claim slightly more credible. However, Emil's claim to have seen one Villager card in the center is still questionable because the Seer typically looks at two cards. But let's not forget, it's possible that a Werewolf or even a Minion is trying to mix things up by pretending to be the Seer. Since Emil's claim is the most suspicious to me due to the inconsistency with the Seer's usual action, I think we should focus our attention there. Emil, why did you choose to only look at one card and not two? It just doesn't add up.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing the suspicion on me regarding the Seer's ability and then pressing Selene for her role and night actions, I aim to divert attention away from myself. This also puts pressure on Selene to reveal her role, which can create more opportunities for uncovering inconsistencies.
> **Emil:** Alright, let's focus here. Kraven's claim and my claim about seeing Villager cards in the center support each other, but it's true that the Seer usually looks at two cards. However, the Seer has the option to look at one card if they want to avoid potential confusion. I felt it was more strategic to confirm a single card to help narrow down our options. Also, Selene, you've been quite vocal about analyzing others' claims, yet you haven't shared what you did last night. Could you please tell us your role and your night actions?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By focusing on Emil's unusual choice to look at only one card as a Seer, I can cast further doubt on him. This helps create enough confusion to protect Emil, who is actually the Werewolf, while also diverting attention away from myself as the Minion.
> **Selene:** Alright, let's really dig into this. Andrei, you've been clear about being a Mason who didn't see another Mason, which suggests one Mason card is in the center. Kraven, you've backed this up by saying you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Emil, your claim of being a Seer and seeing one Villager card in the center is where things start to get muddy for me. Typically, a Seer looks at two cards to gather more information. If we're going to be methodical about this, Emil's choice to look at just one card seems off, and it doesn't align with how a Seer usually operates. It's possible Emil is trying to mislead us by pretending to be the Seer, which is a classic Werewolf move. Emil, if you're truly the Seer, why didn't you use your full ability? This inconsistency is worth scrutinizing.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's claim is inconsistent with the typical Seer behavior, and this inconsistency raises suspicion. By questioning him directly, we can potentially expose any deception and narrow down our suspects.
> **Vladimir:** Emil, your claim of being the Seer and choosing to look at only one card instead of two just doesn't add up to me. The Seer typically looks at two cards to gather more information. Why would you deviate from the usual strategy?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Selene to reveal her role and night actions, I can shift some of the suspicion onto her. This puts pressure on her to explain herself and might expose inconsistencies in her story, allowing me to divert attention away from myself as the potential Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone, let's get to the bottom of this. We've heard a lot of claims, but Selene hasn't really given us any concrete information about her role or actions last night. This is very suspicious to me, especially since she's been pointing fingers without revealing her own role. Selene, could you please tell us your role and what you did during the night phase?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Emil's claim of looking at only one card as a Seer is highly suspicious and inconsistent with the usual Seer action. By pressing him on this point, I can cast more doubt on him, thereby protecting him as the actual Werewolf and diverting suspicion away from myself as the Minion.
> **Selene:** Alright, Emil, let's address this head-on. If you are truly the Seer, explain to us why you chose to look at only one card instead of the usual two. This inconsistency is making it really hard to trust your claim.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing the suspicion on me and pressing Selene for her role and night actions, I aim to divert attention away from myself. This puts pressure on Selene to explain herself and might expose inconsistencies in her story, allowing me to shift the focus away from me as the potential Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Alright, let's break this down one last time. We've got overlapping claims about center cards and roles. Andrei claims to be a Mason who didn't see another Mason, so one Mason card is likely in the center. Kraven claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, which supports Andrei's claim. I claimed to have seen one Villager card in the center, and while it's true that the Seer can look at two cards, I chose to confirm a single card to help narrow down our options. Now, Selene's reluctance to share her role or night actions makes her the most suspicious to me. We need to focus on uncovering all roles to find the Werewolf. Selene, what role did you have, and what did you do last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Kraven about his decision to look at two center cards, I'm diverting attention away from Emil and myself. This also gives me a chance to see if Kraven's explanation has any inconsistencies, which can create further doubt and confusion among the players.
> **Selene:** Alright, let's really break this down because we need to get to the bottom of this. Andrei claims to be a Mason who didn't see another Mason, suggesting one Mason card is in the center. Kraven claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, which supports Andrei's claim. Emil, your claim of being a Seer and only looking at one Villager card in the center is still highly suspicious because the Seer usually looks at two cards to gather more information. This inconsistency is a major red flag for me. Now, I haven't revealed my role yet, and that's because I've been trying to piece together all the information before making any hasty statements. But given all the discussions, I believe the real Werewolf is trying to blend in by making claims that seem helpful but are actually misleading us. Kraven, why did you decide to look at two cards and not just one? Were you trying to gather more information or perhaps create a cover for yourself?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's behavior doesn't match how a Seer should act, and his claim contradicts the typical Seer strategy. Kraven's claim supports my knowledge about the center cards, making Emil's story less credible. Let's stay focused on finding the Werewolf, and right now, Emil is the most suspicious.
> **Andrei:** Everyone, let's focus on the inconsistencies here. Emil's claim of being a Seer who only looked at one center card is highly suspicious. Typically, a Seer looks at two cards to maximize information. Given that Kraven's information aligns with my knowledge of one Mason card being in the center, I find Emil's claim very questionable. I think Emil is trying to deceive us.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** If Emil's claim is inconsistent with typical Seer actions, it raises suspicion that he might be lying to cover up a Werewolf role. Clarifying this discrepancy is crucial to narrowing down our suspects.
> **Kraven:** Emil, your claim of being a Seer who only looked at one center card just doesn't sit right with me. The Seer typically looks at two cards to gather maximum information. Why did you deviate from this standard strategy?


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Selene directly about her role and night actions, I can shift the focus and suspicion onto her, putting pressure on her to explain herself. This can help create doubt and confusion among the players, potentially diverting attention away from me as the potential Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Selene, I find it really suspicious that you've been so reluctant to share your role or actions from last night. It feels like you're trying to stay under the radar and let others take the heat. What exactly did you do last night, and what is your role?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By highlighting the inconsistencies in Emil's claim, I aim to cast further doubt on him while supporting the alignment between Andrei and Kraven. This creates more confusion and protects Emil, the Werewolf, by keeping the suspicion spread out.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, let's consider all the details carefully one more time. Andrei has been consistent in claiming he is a Mason and didn't see another Mason, suggesting one Mason card is in the center. Kraven has supported this by saying he saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Emil's claim as Seer and only looking at one Villager card in the center, however, remains highly suspicious to me because the Seer usually looks at two cards to maximize information. This inconsistency makes Emil's claim very questionable. Now, I have been listening closely to gather all the information before making any bold statements. Given all the discussions so far, I believe that Kraven's and Andrei's claims align more closely, and Emil's choice to deviate from the standard Seer action is highly suspect.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene's reluctance to reveal information needs to be addressed. If she's on the Village team, she should be transparent. This also helps shift some of the suspicion away from me.
> **Emil:** Alright, everyone, let's analyze this situation one more time with all the information we've gathered. Andrei claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, suggesting one Mason card is in the center. Kraven supports this by saying he saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. I claimed to have seen one Villager card in the center, which might seem suspicious because the Seer usually looks at two cards. But let's not forget that sometimes the Seer looks at one card to avoid confusing multiple pieces of information. Meanwhile, Selene has been quite vocal without sharing her role. This reluctance to reveal her role and actions makes me really suspicious. Selene, if you truly are a Villager or any other role on the Village team, you should have nothing to hide. What exactly did you do last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By pointing out the inconsistency in Emil's claim and questioning his actions, I aim to cast doubt on him. This aligns with my goal as a Minion to protect the Werewolf by creating confusion and diverting suspicion away from Emil.
> **Selene:** Alright, team, let's think about this step by step. Andrei has been consistent with his claim as a Mason who didn't see another Mason, which suggests one Mason card is in the center. Kraven has backed this up by saying he saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Now, Emil, your claim as the Seer and only looking at one Villager card in the center is still highly suspicious to me. The Seer usually looks at two cards to maximize information. This inconsistency makes me question your claim. Given all the information, I believe that Emil might be trying to mislead us. Shouldn't we consider that Emil could be the Werewolf trying to confuse us?


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** By highlighting the inconsistencies in Emil's claim and keeping the focus on him, I aim to protect him as the actual Werewolf. This approach helps to divert suspicion away from Emil and creates further confusion among the players, which is beneficial for the Werewolf team.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, let's think this through methodically and not jump to conclusions. Andrei's claim about being a Mason and not seeing another Mason checks out if there's one Mason card in the center. Kraven's story about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center also aligns with Andrei's information. Now, Emil's claim of being the Seer and only looking at one center card is definitely unusual because the Seer typically looks at two cards to get more information. This inconsistency is a major red flag. Given all the information we have, I find Emil's explanation insufficient and highly suspicious. What if Emil is actually the Werewolf trying to mislead us by pretending to have useful information? We should be very wary of Emil's claims because they just don't add up.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Given the conflicting claims, it's important to scrutinize Kraven's actions closely. If he's lying, it could expose him as a Werewolf or Minion. His choice to look at two cards should be explained thoroughly.
> **Vladimir:** Kraven, why did you choose to look at two cards instead of just one? Were you trying to gather more information or create a cover for yourself?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know that looking at two cards is the most effective way to gather information. Emil's inconsistent claim raises a significant red flag, suggesting he might be trying to mislead us. Clarifying this discrepancy is crucial to identifying if Emil is the Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Emil, your claim of being the Seer and only looking at one center card is highly suspicious. The Seer typically looks at two cards to maximize information. Why did you choose to deviate from this strategy?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's claim of being the Seer and only looking at one card in the center is highly suspicious, as the Seer typically looks at two cards to gather more information. This inconsistency makes Emil's story less credible, and given the alignment of claims from Andrei and Kraven about the center cards, Emil appears to be the most suspicious and likely to be the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil's claim of being the Seer and only looking at one center card is highly inconsistent with how the Seer should operate, which raises significant suspicion. Given that Andrei's and my information align well regarding the Mason and Villager cards in the center, Emil's story doesn't add up. This inconsistency suggests he could be trying to mislead us and might be the Werewolf.
> **Kraven [Seer]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Emil (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven's claim to have looked at two cards in the center is suspicious because it aligns too neatly with Andrei's Mason claim but leaves room for doubt about the presence of Werewolves in the center. This inconsistency and the overlap with my story cast doubt on Kraven, making him the most likely target for the village to vote out.
> **Emil [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Selene (thoughts as Minion):*** Given the highly suspicious and inconsistent claim Emil made about being the Seer and only looking at one center card when the Seer typically looks at two, it raises significant doubt about his role. By voting for Emil, I aim to align with the general suspicion created around him and increase the chances of someone other than the actual Werewolf (Emil) being voted out. This strategy helps protect Emil and fulfills my role as the Minion.
> **Selene [Minion]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's claim of being the Seer and only looking at one center card is highly suspicious because the Seer typically looks at two cards to gather more information. This inconsistency makes Emil's claim very questionable. Additionally, Andrei's and Kraven's claims align more closely, suggesting that Emil might be trying to mislead us. Therefore, I believe Emil is the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf.
> **Vladimir [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Kraven : Seer : 1
* Emil : Werewolf : 4



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The villagers win.
