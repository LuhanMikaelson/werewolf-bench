## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexia. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Semira and Selene. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dragos. They are thinking about their action.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles that are not in play. This will help us narrow down the possible roles of the other players, making it easier to identify the werewolves. Additionally, if I find a Werewolf card in the center, I can confidently assert that there may be only one or no werewolves among the players.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing that I'm a Mason and confirming Selene as the other Mason, I'm establishing a trustworthy base. Now, I need to gather information from Dragos and Alexia to see if their responses line up or if they start acting suspiciously.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's get this started! I'm a Mason and I know that Selene is the other Mason. This means we're both on the village team. We need to find out who the Werewolves are. Dragos and Alexia, what roles did you get?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to gather more information from Dragos and Alexia to identify who the Werewolves might be. By knowing their roles, we can cross-reference their statements with any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies.
> **Selene:** Semira has already mentioned that we are both Masons, so we can trust each other. Dragos and Alexia, could you both share your roles with us?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Claiming the Seer role and providing information about the center cards could lend credibility to my statement while casting doubt on Dragos and keeping suspicion away from me.
> **Alexia:** Alright, so Semira and Selene are claiming to be Masons. Assuming that's true, we have two confirmed Villagers. As for my role, I'm the Seer. During the night, I checked two of the center cards and saw the Drunk and a Villager there. This means the remaining roles are spread between the three of us. Dragos, what do you have to say about your role?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I know I am the true Seer, Alexia must be lying. This makes me suspect that she could be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the real Werewolves. By confronting her directly, I want to see how she responds and gauge the reactions of the other players to gather more information.
> **Dragos:** Alexia, I find your claim quite interesting. I am the actual Seer and during the night, I saw two center cards: Villager and Minion. This directly contradicts your claim of seeing the Drunk and a Villager. Can you explain this discrepancy?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Given that Dragos is contradicting my claim, I need to cast doubt on his credibility. By highlighting the timing of his response and the inconsistency in his claims about the center cards, I can make it appear that he is the one being deceptive, which would help shift suspicion away from me.
> **Alexia:** Dragos, your claim to be the actual Seer is highly suspicious to me. If you truly were the Seer, why didn't you reveal this information first before I did? Also, you have a completely different set of cards from what I saw in the center. How do you explain this inconsistency?


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** By breaking down the claims and using logical reasoning, I can help the village team identify who is lying. Alexia's contradictory information suggests she is not on the village team.
> **Dragos:** Let's break this down step by step. Semira and Selene are claiming to be Masons, which means they should know each other. If this is true, they are on the village team. Alexia, on the other hand, is claiming to be the Seer but has provided information that directly contradicts what I saw. Since I know for a fact that I am the real Seer, and I saw the Villager and Minion in the center, Alexia must be lying. This makes me highly suspect that Alexia could be one of the werewolves or the Minion trying to protect the actual werewolves.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Alexia and Dragos have conflicting claims, pressing Alexia for more details could reveal inconsistencies in her story and help us identify if she's lying.
> **Lucian:** Alright, let's break this down a bit more. Semira and Selene both claim to be Masons, and their stories align, which gives them some credibility. However, we have a conflicting claim from Alexia and Dragos both stating they are the Seer. One of them is lying, and considering the Seer role is crucial for the village, we need to figure out who is telling the truth. Alexia, if you really are the Seer, why did you choose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card? This is important because it could help us determine your true role.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the focus towards Lucian, I can deflect some of the suspicion away from myself and prompt Lucian to reveal his role. This move might expose inconsistencies in his claims or create new avenues for casting doubt on other players, helping to keep the focus off me.
> **Alexia:** Lucian, before I answer your question, I'd like to understand your perspective a bit better. What role are you claiming, and why have you not shared your information so far?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to get more detailed information from Alexia to verify her claim and compare it with Dragos's claim. If her reasoning doesn't make sense or she stumbles, it could indicate she's lying.
> **Lucian:** Alright, we've got some conflicting claims about the Seer. Alexia, you mentioned you saw the Drunk and a Villager in the center. Can you explain in more detail why you chose to look at the center cards and not another player's card? This will help us understand your reasoning better.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Dragos's timing and pushing Lucian to reveal his role, I can shift suspicion away from myself and create potential inconsistencies in their stories. This will help me blend in and avoid being targeted.
> **Alexia:** Dragos, your claim to be the Seer just doesn't add up. If you were really the Seer, you should have been the first to reveal the information about the center cards. Instead, you waited until after I made my statement. This delay in sharing your information is highly suspicious to me. Additionally, Lucian hasn't shared his role, which makes me wonder why he's staying silent. Lucian, could you please tell us your role and any information you have?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Semira and Selene's Mason claims align, they are likely trustworthy. The conflicting Seer claims between Alexia and Dragos are crucial. Identifying the liar will help us narrow down the Werewolves. We need to press them further for more details.
> **Lucian:** Alright, let’s break this down step by step. Semira and Selene have both claimed to be Masons, and their stories align. This gives them credibility. However, we have conflicting claims from Alexia and Dragos, with both stating they are the Seer. This means one of them is definitely lying. If we can figure out who is lying, we might have a lead on who the Werewolves are.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** By reiterating the logical breakdown and pointing out the conflicting information, it helps reinforce the credibility of my claim as the true Seer and casts doubt on Alexia's claim. This will help the rest of the players understand where the inconsistency lies and drive suspicion towards Alexia.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's think this through logically. Semira and Selene both claim to be Masons and their stories align. That gives them credibility as villagers. However, we have a conflict between Alexia and me regarding the Seer role. Since I am the actual Seer and saw the Villager and Minion in the center, Alexia must be lying. This makes me highly suspect she is either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the actual Werewolves.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to figure out if Lucian is hiding something that might help us identify the Werewolves. His silence is suspicious, especially with the conflicting Seer claims.
> **Semira:** Alright, let's break this down. Semira and Selene are confirmed Masons, so we can trust each other. But we need to address the conflicting Seer claims. I'm leaning towards Dragos being the real Seer because he provided a detailed explanation and was quick to call out Alexia. Lucian, you've been quiet about your role. What are you hiding? What role do you claim to be?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Understanding why Alexia chose to look at the center cards rather than another player's card can give us insights into her true role. It might help us determine if she's telling the truth or just fabricating her story to protect the Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, we've got a big contradiction here between Alexia and Dragos. One of them has to be lying. Semira and Selene, since you both confirmed each other as Masons, you're probably trustworthy. We need to get to the bottom of this Seer claim. Alexia, why did you decide to check the center cards instead of another player's card? Your reasoning here is crucial.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the focus towards Lucian, I can deflect some of the suspicion away from myself and prompt Lucian to reveal his role. This move might expose inconsistencies in his claims or create new avenues for casting doubt on other players, helping to keep the focus off me.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, let's break this down logically. Semira and Selene have confirmed each other as Masons, which seems credible. We now have conflicting claims about the Seer role from Dragos and myself. I understand that this raises suspicion, but I want to address Lucian's silence. Lucian, you haven't shared your role yet, and your silence is quite suspicious. Considering we need to uncover the werewolves, it's crucial for everyone to share information. Lucian, what role are you claiming, and do you have any information that can help us?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Understanding why Alexia chose to look at the center cards can help us identify inconsistencies in her story. If her reasoning doesn't make sense, it might indicate she's lying.
> **Lucian:** Alright, let's clarify some things here. Semira and Selene have confirmed each other as Masons, which makes them likely trustworthy. Now, we have a conflicting Seer claim from Alexia and Dragos. Alexia mentioned seeing the Drunk and Villager in the center, while Dragos said he saw the Villager and Minion. This contradiction is key. Alexia, if you're really the Seer, why did you choose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card? Your reasoning here could help us figure out the truth.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Directing the focus towards Lucian can help deflect suspicion away from myself and prompt him to reveal his role. This move might expose inconsistencies in his claims or create new avenues for casting doubt on other players, helping to keep the focus off me.
> **Alexia:** Lucian, you've been incredibly quiet about your role throughout this discussion. Given that we have conflicting claims about the Seer role from Dragos and myself, your silence is highly suspicious. It's crucial for everyone to share their roles and any information they have. Lucian, could you please tell us your role and any information that can help us determine the truth?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's claim directly contradicts Dragos's claim, and understanding her reasoning for checking the center cards might help us identify if she's lying. We need to get to the bottom of this conflicting Seer claim to identify the werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Alright Alexia, if you truly are the Seer, why didn't you check another player's card instead of the center cards? We need to understand your reasoning here.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Dragos's actions directly and highlighting the inconsistency in his claim, I hope to cast doubt on his credibility and shift suspicion away from myself. This will help me blend in and avoid being targeted as the Werewolf.
> **Alexia:** Everyone, let's think this through carefully. Semira and Selene have confirmed each other as Masons, which seems credible. But we have a conflicting Seer claim from Dragos and myself. I understand that this raises suspicion, and it's crucial to get to the bottom of this. Dragos, if you're truly the Seer, why didn't you check another player's card? This inconsistency in your actions is highly suspicious to me.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** As the true Seer, I know Alexia is lying about her role. Her conflicting information suggests she is not on the village team. The logical step is to focus our votes on Alexia to increase our chances of eliminating a threat.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's focus on the facts. We have conflicting Seer claims between Alexia and me. I know I am the real Seer and saw the Villager and Minion in the center. This directly contradicts Alexia’s claim. Given this contradiction, Alexia is our prime suspect. We need to vote for Alexia to ensure we eliminate a potential Werewolf or Minion.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** We need everyone to be transparent about their roles to identify the Werewolves. Lucian's silence is suspicious and we need to know his role to analyze the situation better.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's think this through carefully. Semira and I are confirmed Masons, so we know we can trust each other. We now have conflicting Seer claims from Alexia and Dragos. Given that Dragos provided a detailed explanation and was quick to call out Alexia, I'm inclined to believe him. Lucian, you've been silent for too long. What role are you claiming, and why haven't you shared this information sooner?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Understanding Alexia's reasoning for her night action is key to determining if she is lying. Her explanation might reveal inconsistencies and help us identify the real Seer.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's think this through logically. Semira and Selene have confirmed each other as Masons, which gives them credibility. We now have conflicting Seer claims from Alexia and Dragos. Since one of them has to be lying, we need to determine who the liar is to identify the Werewolves or Minion. Given that Alexia claimed to see the Drunk and Villager in the center, but Dragos claimed to see the Villager and Minion, we have a clear contradiction. Alexia, your reasoning for checking the center cards instead of another player's card is crucial here. Why did you decide to check the center cards?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By emphasizing the timing of Dragos's response and questioning Lucian's silence, I can cast doubt on Dragos's claim while shifting some suspicion towards Lucian. This move might expose inconsistencies in their claims and keep the focus off me.
> **Alexia:** Alright, everyone, we need to stay logical and focused here. Semira and Selene claim to be Masons and confirm each other. This gives them credibility. Now, we're left with a conflicting Seer claim between Dragos and me. If I were really lying, why would I have been the first to provide detailed information about the center cards? It makes no sense for a Werewolf to volunteer information that contradicts the actual Seer. Dragos, on the other hand, only spoke up after I did, which seems like a reaction to my claim rather than a genuine assertion. Additionally, Lucian has been silent about his role, which is suspicious. Lucian, you need to tell us your role now to help us figure out the truth.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Both Alexia and Dragos are claiming to be the Seer, but there's a contradiction in their statements. Understanding Dragos’s reasoning for his night action can help us determine if he is telling the truth or lying.
> **Lucian:** Dragos, it's crucial for us to understand why you chose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card if you are truly the Seer.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** We have a clear contradiction between Alexia's and my claims as the Seer. Since one of us is lying, it's crucial for everyone to share their information. Lucian's silence is suspicious and understanding his role could help us determine the truth.
> **Dragos:** Lucian, you've been remarkably quiet about your role throughout this discussion. Given the conflicting claims between Alexia and me about the Seer role, your silence is highly suspicious. Could you please tell us what role you are claiming and any information you have?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Alexia and Dragos have conflicting claims, understanding their reasoning for their night actions can help us identify who is lying. Alexia's explanation for checking the center cards rather than another player's card might reveal if she's fabricating her story.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, we have a clear contradiction between Alexia and Dragos about the Seer role. Given that one of them is definitely lying, I think it's crucial to press them further. Alexia, if you're truly the Seer, why didn't you check another player's card instead of the center cards? Your reasoning for this choice is key to understanding your true role.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Dragos's actions and motives directly, I aim to cast doubt on his credibility. This also allows me to shift the focus away from myself and highlight the inconsistencies in Dragos's claims, making him appear more suspicious to the others.
> **Alexia:** Dragos, your claim to be the Seer just doesn't sit right with me. If you were truly the Seer, you should have revealed your information about the center cards immediately. But you only spoke up after I did, which seems more like you're reacting to my claim rather than making a genuine assertion. Also, why would I volunteer detailed information about the center if I were lying? It makes no sense for a Werewolf to provide contradictory information knowingly.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** By understanding why Alexia chose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card, we can gather more information about her reasoning and determine if she is lying.
> **Dragos:** Alexia, if you truly are the Seer, why didn't you check another player's card instead of the center cards? Your reasoning for this choice is key to understanding your true role.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly questioning Dragos's timing and motives, I aim to cast doubt on his credibility and shift the focus away from myself. Highlighting the inconsistency in Dragos's actions will make him appear more suspicious to the others and help me blend in as a Villager.
> **Alexia:** Dragos, I find your claim to be the Seer highly suspicious. You waited until after I revealed my information to make your claim. If you were truly the Seer, why didn't you speak up first? This delay makes it seem like you were trying to adapt to my statement rather than provide genuine information. Masons Semira and Selene, consider this: Why would I risk making a detailed claim about the center cards if I were lying? It doesn't add up. Dragos's late response and contradictory information make him a prime suspect for being a Werewolf or Minion.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** Given the conflicting claims between Alexia and me about the Seer role, understanding Lucian's role and any information he has could be crucial in determining who is lying and identifying the Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Lucian, you have been incredibly quiet about your role, and your silence is highly suspicious. Could you please tell us what role you are claiming and any information you have?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Both Selene and I are confirmed as Masons, which means we're trustworthy. Dragos and Alexia both claim to be the Seer, but their information about the center cards contradicts each other. Dragos was quick to call out Alexia's claim and provided a detailed explanation. Alexia, on the other hand, was defensive and argued inconsistently. I believe Dragos is the real Seer, making Alexia highly suspicious as either a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Semira [Mason]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Given the conflicting claims between Alexia and Dragos about the Seer role, and the fact that Dragos was quick to call out Alexia with detailed information, I'm inclined to believe Dragos. Additionally, Semira and I are confirmed Masons, which adds credibility to our judgments. Therefore, I'm voting for Alexia as she is the most likely suspect to be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Selene [Mason]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Dragos's responses have been reactionary and contradictory to my claims. His delayed response to my Seer claim raises suspicion, as it seems he's trying to adapt to my statements rather than providing genuine information. By voting for Dragos, I align with the evidence suggesting he's not being truthful, and this helps me blend in with the village while casting doubt away from myself.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dragos.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Given the conflicting claims about the Seer role, Alexia provided information about the center cards that contradicts Dragos's claim. Since only one of them can be the true Seer, and considering Alexia's reasoning for checking the center cards was less convincing, it seems more likely that Alexia is lying. Furthermore, Semira and Selene's Mason claims align, making them trustworthy. Therefore, by process of elimination, Alexia is the most suspicious and likely to be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Dragos (thoughts as Seer):*** I have claimed to be the Seer and provided information that I saw a Villager and Minion in the center cards. Alexia claimed to be the Seer and provided contradictory information, stating she saw the Drunk and a Villager in the center cards. Given this clear contradiction, it is highly likely that Alexia is either a Werewolf or the Minion. Semira and Selene have confirmed each other as Masons, which makes them trustworthy. Lucian's silence is suspicious, but Alexia's conflicting claim directly challenges my role as the Seer. Therefore, I believe Alexia is lying and should be voted out to eliminate a potential threat to the village team.
> **Dragos [Seer]:** I am voting for Alexia.


The votes were:
* Alexia : Werewolf : 4
* Dragos : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Alexia was killed. The villagers win.
