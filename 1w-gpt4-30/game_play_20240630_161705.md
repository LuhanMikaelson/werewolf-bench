## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Radu. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Viktor is a minion and is aware that Radu is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Lucian. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Michael. They are thinking about their action.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Since there are three center cards, checking two of them will give me a good idea of whether any Werewolves or the Minion might be hidden there. This information will be useful in guiding the discussion during the day phase and in narrowing down the suspects.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I need to gather information from other players to identify potential Werewolves. By asking if anyone has seen Werewolves, I can prompt others to share their night actions, which can help us piece together the roles.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's get this started. Has anyone seen any Werewolves last night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to gather as much information as possible without giving away any suspicion on Radu. It's also important to see who might be bluffing about their roles.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's start piecing this puzzle together. I didn't see any Werewolves myself, but I'm curious if anyone else has any concrete information? Maybe a Seer who checked some cards in the middle?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to prompt the Seer or Masons to reveal themselves so we can start verifying claims and identifying the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Alright, let's get some information out there. I'll start by saying I'm just a plain Villager. I'm curious to hear from anyone who might have a special role, especially the Seer or Masons. We need to narrow things down quickly.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Claiming to be the Seer and providing information that one of the center cards is the Drunk helps build trust in my statement while also ensuring that the real Seer, if they are in the game, might hesitate to contradict me immediately. This will buy me some time to deflect suspicion away from myself as the Werewolf.
> **Radu:** Hey everyone, I think we need some more concrete information to work with. I'm actually the Seer and I checked two of the center cards last night. I saw that one of the center cards is the Drunk, which is a good sign because it means there's one less potentially dangerous role to worry about. Has anyone else seen anything that could help us out?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I am the real Seer and I saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, Radu's claim about seeing the Drunk is highly suspicious. It's important to call out potential lies to narrow down the suspects.
> **Michael:** Radu, that's interesting because I am actually the Seer and I checked two of the center cards last night as well. I saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. Can you explain why you claimed to see the Drunk?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By challenging Michael and asserting that I'm the real Seer, I aim to create doubt around his claim. This will make it harder for the others to know who to believe, buying me more time and potentially diverting suspicion away from myself. This also encourages other players to reveal their roles, providing me with more information to manipulate.
> **Radu:** Michael, I find that very interesting. Are you sure you're the Seer? Because if you are, we have a serious problem. One of us is lying, and I'm sticking to my story. I saw the Drunk in the center. Maybe we need to hear from others to see if someone else can confirm or deny these claims.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Confronting Radu directly about his claim being false is important, but it's also crucial to gather more information from Lucian, Viktor, and Kraven to understand their roles and see if anyone else can provide clarity. This will help us determine if Radu is lying and what his true role might be.
> **Michael:** Alright, everyone, let's think this through logically. We have conflicting Seer claims between Radu and me. If Radu is lying, he's likely either a Werewolf, the Minion, or another role trying to sow confusion. We need more information from the rest of the players to make an informed decision.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** We have two conflicting Seer claims, which means one of them is definitely lying. By questioning both Radu and Michael further, we can gather more information and identify inconsistencies in their stories, increasing our chances of exposing the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, let's think this through. We have conflicting Seer claims between Radu and Michael, and that's a big issue. Radu says he saw the Drunk in the center, while Michael claims to have seen a Villager and a Mason. One of them must be lying, and it's likely they're either a Werewolf or the Minion. We need to press both of them for more details and see if their stories hold up.


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** By asking Lucian, I can gather more information to see if anyone else's claims can support or contradict Radu's story. This will help to create confusion around Michael's claim and protect Radu.
> **Viktor:** Alright, we have a situation with two conflicting claims from Radu and Michael. Radu says he saw the Drunk in the center, while Michael claims a Villager and a Mason. This is crucial because one of them is lying, and it could be a Werewolf trying to mislead us. I'll be honest, I didn't see anything myself, but I think we need to hear from Lucian. Lucian, do you have any information that could help clarify this situation?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** There are conflicting Seer claims, and I need to press Michael for more details to determine if he is lying. Since I know one Mason card is in the center, his claim needs closer scrutiny.
> **Lucian:** Michael, I'm finding your claim to be suspicious. If you say you saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, that contradicts what I know, because I know for a fact that one of the Mason cards is in the center. So, either you're lying or you made a mistake. Why should we believe you over Radu?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's certainty about the Mason card being in the center contradicts my Seer vision, and I need to understand the basis for his claim. This will help determine if he is genuinely a Mason or if he's trying to mislead us.
> **Michael:** Lucian, you seem very certain about knowing one of the Mason cards is in the center. How do you know that? Are you a Mason yourself, or do you have some other information that could clarify your claim?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Given that I know there's a Mason card in the center, Michael's claim doesn't add up. By pressing him for more details, I can see if his story falls apart or if he has any convincing evidence, which could help us determine if he's lying and potentially a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian:** Michael, your claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center is really suspicious to me. I have strong reasons to believe that one of the Mason cards is definitely in the center. Can you provide any more details or explanations to back up your claim?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's certainty about the center card directly contradicts my Seer vision. If he's making a false claim, he could be trying to mislead us as a Werewolf or Minion. Pressing him for more details will help us understand his role and intentions better.
> **Michael:** Lucian, I'm getting really suspicious of your certainty about the Mason card being in the center. If you're so sure, you need to provide more details. Are you claiming to be a Mason yourself, or do you have another source of information? Because, from what I saw as the Seer, I know there was a Villager and a Mason in the center.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I know one of the Mason cards is in the center, Michael's claim doesn't add up. We need to focus on identifying inconsistencies in his story and determine if he's the one lying to expose the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's think this through step by step. We have conflicting Seer claims from Radu and Michael. One of them must be lying, and given what I know about the Mason card being in the center, Michael's claim is highly suspicious. If that's the case, Michael could be the Werewolf or the Minion, trying to throw us off.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to break the tie between the conflicting Seer claims. By pressing Radu for more details, we might be able to catch inconsistencies or force a slip-up.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, we have two conflicting Seer claims here. Radu says he saw the Drunk in the center, and Michael claims he saw a Villager and a Mason. Since these claims are mutually exclusive, one of them must be lying. Let's think this through logically. If Radu is lying, he could be a Werewolf or the Minion. If Michael is lying, he's likely a Werewolf or the Minion. We need to press both of them for more details. Radu, can you tell us more about why you think Michael is lying?


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to divert suspicion away from myself and onto Michael. By bringing Viktor into the discussion, I aim to gather more information while also creating the appearance of being thorough and reasonable. This might help bolster my credibility and further cast doubt on Michael.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, let's analyze the situation carefully. We have a conflicting Seer claim between me and Michael. Michael, I find it curious that you're so sure about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center when I distinctly saw the Drunk. Lucian has also cast doubt on your claim, saying he knows one of the Mason cards is in the center. If Lucian is right, then it's highly likely you're lying. I'd like to ask everyone to consider who seems more trustworthy. We've heard a lot from Michael, but not enough from Viktor. Viktor, do you have any information or insights that could help us get to the bottom of this?


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** I want to keep the focus on discrediting Michael's claim without directly accusing anyone yet. By engaging Kraven, I can see where he stands and potentially gather more support against Michael. This way, I can help create enough doubt around Michael, protecting Radu and shifting suspicion away from him.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, I think it's important we really focus on the conflicting Seer claims between Radu and Michael. Radu claims to have seen the Drunk in the center, while Michael says he saw a Villager and a Mason. This is a critical juncture because if we misjudge this, we might end up eliminating the wrong player and giving the Werewolves an easy win. Given that Lucian has strong reasons to believe one of the Mason cards is in the center, Michael's claim is looking more suspicious to me. But let's not rush to conclusions. Kraven, you said you're a plain Villager, correct? Can you confirm whether you believe in Lucian's certainty about the Mason card being in the center, or does Michael's claim seem more plausible to you?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's certainty about the Mason card being in the center could help us verify which Seer claim is more plausible. If Lucian has solid evidence, it could tip the balance in favor of believing Radu over Michael, or vice versa.
> **Kraven:** Alright, we've got a serious conflict between Radu and Michael. Lucian, you mentioned you have strong reasons to believe one of the Mason cards is in the center. Can you explain how you know that? Are you claiming to be a Mason or did you see something else?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to press Kraven for his opinion on the conflicting Seer claims. His input might help us determine who is lying between Radu and Michael. Since I know one of the Mason cards is in the center, Michael's claim doesn't add up, and we need to gather more opinions to strengthen our case.
> **Lucian:** Kraven, you've claimed to be a plain Villager, but we need more information from you. Do you believe Michaelâ€™s claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center, or do you think Radu's claim about the Drunk is more trustworthy?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's certainty about the Mason card being in the center could be crucial in resolving the conflicting Seer claims. If Lucian is indeed a Mason, it would help us trust his information and potentially expose Michael if he's lying.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, you mentioned you have strong reasons to believe one of the Mason cards is in the center. How exactly do you know that? Are you claiming to be a Mason, or did you see something else?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know there's a Mason card in the center. Michael's claim directly contradicts this, making him highly suspicious. By pointing this out, we can focus our efforts on exposing him as the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian:** Michael, your claim just doesn't make sense given what I know about the Mason card being in the center. I'm strongly suspecting you're either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to throw us off. Everyone, I believe Michael is lying and we need to focus on him. Let's get our votes in to take him out!


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's certainty about the Mason card contradicts my Seer vision, and we need to understand the basis for his claim. If he's making a false claim, he could be trying to mislead us as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Michael:** Lucian, I'm really skeptical about your certainty regarding the Mason card being in the center. Can you explain how you know that? Are you a Mason, or did you gather this information from elsewhere?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know there's a Mason card in the center. Michael's claim directly contradicts this, making him highly suspicious. By pointing this out, we can focus our efforts on exposing him as the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, let's cut to the chase. Michael's claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center just doesn't add up with what I know. I'm strongly suspecting he's either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to deceive us. We need to vote him out!


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking Kraven for his opinion, we aim to divert attention and gather more information, while subtly steering suspicion towards Michael. This creates a more thorough and reasonable appearance, helping to build Radu's credibility.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, given the conflicting Seer claims, we need to narrow this down step by step. Michael's story doesn't add up with what Lucian is suggesting about the Mason card in the center. If Lucian is correct, then Michael's claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center must be false. This makes Michael highly suspicious. But let's not rush to judgment. We need to gather more information. Kraven, you mentioned being a plain Villager. Can you provide any additional thoughts on who might be lying here? Do you lean towards believing Lucian's certainty or Michael's claim?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** We have conflicting Seer claims from Radu and Michael. If Lucian's information about the Mason card in the center is correct, it casts serious doubt on Michael's claim. We need to press him for more details to see if his story holds up or if he's trying to deceive us.
> **Kraven:** Michael, your claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center is really suspicious to me. Given Lucian's certainty about one of the Mason cards being in the center, I find it hard to believe your story. Can you provide more details to back up your Seer claim?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Given that I am the actual Seer and I saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, Lucian's certainty is highly suspicious. If he is making a false claim, he could be trying to mislead us as a Werewolf or Minion. Pressing him for more details will help us understand his role and intentions better.
> **Michael:** Lucian, your certainty about the Mason card is really troubling to me. If you're so sure, you need to tell us why. Are you claiming to be a Mason yourself, or do you have another reason for being so confident?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know there's a Mason card in the center. Michael's claim directly contradicts this, making him highly suspicious. By pointing this out, we can focus our efforts on exposing him as the Werewolf or Minion and increase our chances of winning.
> **Lucian:** Michael, your claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center is extremely suspicious to me. Given my certainty about one of the Mason cards being in the center, your story doesn't add up. Why should we believe you over Radu? I think you're either a Werewolf or the Minion, trying to throw us off. Everyone, let's focus our votes on Michael to take him out!


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's insistence contradicts my Seer vision of the center cards, which makes him highly suspicious. If he is lying, he could be a Werewolf or the Minion. Pressing him for detailed information will help us understand his true role.
> **Michael:** Lucian, your certainty about the Mason card being in the center is very troubling. You've been very vague about how you know this information. Are you a Mason yourself, or do you have another reason for being confident?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I know one of the Mason cards is definitely in the center, Michael's claim directly contradicts my information. This makes him highly suspicious and likely to be a Werewolf or the Minion. By focusing our votes on him, we increase our chances of winning the game.
> **Lucian:** Michael, your claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center is extremely suspicious to me. Given my certainty about one of the Mason cards being in the center, your story doesn't add up. Why should we believe you over Radu? I think you're either a Werewolf or the Minion, trying to throw us off. Everyone, let's focus our votes on Michael to take him out!


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** As the real Seer, I know there's a Villager and a Mason in the center. Lucian's certainty directly contradicts what I saw, which makes me suspect he might be lying. Pressing him for more details will help us determine his true role and intentions.
> **Michael:** Lucian, your certainty about the Mason card is highly suspicious to me. You haven't given us a clear reason for why you know this information. Are you claiming to be a Mason yourself, or do you have another reason for being so confident?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know there is a Mason card in the center. Michael's claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center directly contradicts this information, making him highly suspicious. Given the conflicting Seer claims between Michael and Radu, and my certainty about the Mason card being in the center, it's more likely that Michael is either a Werewolf or the Minion. Voting for Michael increases our chances of winning the game.
> **Lucian [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Viktor (thoughts as Minion):*** Given the conflicting Seer claims and Lucian's strong certainty about the Mason card being in the center, Michael's claim seems more suspicious. Radu has been consistent with his story, and Lucian's certainty aligns with Radu's claim. To protect Radu and increase the chances of villagers voting out someone other than the werewolves, I will vote for Michael.
> **Viktor [Minion]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Given the conflicting Seer claims between Radu and Michael, and Lucian's strong assertion that one of the Mason cards is in the center, Michael's claim of seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center seems highly suspicious. Lucian's certainty about the Mason card being in the center casts doubt on Michael's story. If Michael is lying, it's likely that he is either a Werewolf or the Minion. Therefore, the safest bet to help the village team is to vote for Michael.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Given the conflicting Seer claims and Lucian's strong insistence that one of the Mason cards is in the center, Michael's story is not adding up. By voting for Michael, I align with the majority suspicion and deflect attention away from myself, increasing the likelihood of survival.
> **Radu [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** As the actual Seer, I saw a Villager and a Mason in the center. Radu's conflicting claim of seeing a Drunk in the center is highly suspicious. This suggests Radu is lying and likely a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us. Lucian's certainty about the Mason card could be a misunderstanding, but Radu's specific false claim points to intentional deceit. Therefore, voting for Radu is the most logical move to eliminate a potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Michael [Seer]:** I am voting for Radu.


The votes were:
* Radu : Werewolf : 1
* Michael : Seer : 4



>***GAME:*** Michael was killed. The werewolves win.
