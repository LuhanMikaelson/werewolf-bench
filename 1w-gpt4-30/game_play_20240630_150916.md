## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to establish trust with Lucian, as I know he is the other Mason. Asking about the center cards could reveal valuable information if someone claims to be the Seer or if there's a Werewolf who has seen a center card.
> **Dracula:** Lucian, I know you’re the other Mason. Let’s work together to find the Werewolves. Does anyone have any information on the center cards?


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Dracula and I are Masons, we know we’re both on the village team. Confirming this upfront helps us to focus on identifying the Werewolves. Asking about center cards or other players' roles might reveal valuable information.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, I'm confident Dracula and I are the Masons. We need to figure out who the Werewolves are quickly. Did anyone have a look at the center cards or other players' roles?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** We need to gather as much information as possible to narrow down the suspects. By putting Kraven on the spot, we might be able to unearth more details or catch him in a lie, which would be beneficial for my goal of protecting Viktor.
> **Marius:** Alright, Dracula and Lucian, if you both claim to be Masons, then we should have quite a bit of information already. I haven't heard anything from Kraven yet. Kraven, could you tell us your role or if you have any information on the center cards?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** I need to gather more information to make an informed decision. By asking everyone if they have seen or done anything, I might be able to catch a Werewolf in a lie or confirm who the Seer might be.
> **Kraven:** Alright, everyone. If Dracula and Lucian are claiming to be the Masons, we've got to figure out who the Werewolves are quickly. Has anyone seen or done anything that could help us identify the Werewolves?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information from Marius to determine his role and potentially catch any inconsistencies. This will help us confirm or deny the claims of being the Masons and find the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Alright folks, if Dracula and Lucian are truly the Masons, that narrows down our suspects. Marius, have you seen anything or can you share more about your role?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting pressure on Kraven, I can divert attention away from Viktor and potentially make Kraven slip up or become the primary suspect. This helps in protecting Viktor, who is the Werewolf I'm trying to shield.
> **Marius:** Alright, since Dracula and Lucian are claiming Masons, that means they should have seen each other during the night. If they're telling the truth, then both of them are likely clear. Now, if we assume they're not lying, it narrows things down a lot. Kraven, you've been pretty quiet and vague so far. Can you tell us more about your role or if you've seen anything suspicious?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been vague and keeps pushing for information without providing much himself. It's important to get a clear claim from him to either confirm or deny his role, which will help us narrow down the suspects.
> **Kraven:** Alright, Marius, you've been deflecting a lot and haven't given us much concrete information. What role do you claim to have? We need to know if you have any useful information that can help us identify the Werewolves.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Viktor on the spot, I can control the narrative and potentially steer suspicion away from him and onto someone else. This helps in protecting Viktor, who is the Werewolf I'm trying to shield. Additionally, it creates confusion and keeps the focus shifting, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Marius:** Alright, let's think about this logically. If Dracula and Lucian are claiming to be the Masons, that means they should have seen each other during the night. Viktor, you've been unusually quiet. What role are you claiming to have, and do you have any information on the center cards?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Claiming to be the Seer and providing specific information about the center cards can help cast doubt on others and divert suspicion away from me. By stating that I saw one Werewolf card in the center, it supports the idea that the other Werewolf is among the players, thus deflecting suspicion off me.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, I need to clear my name here. I am the Seer, and during the night, I opted to look at two of the center cards. One of them was indeed a Werewolf, and the other was a Villager. This means there’s still one Werewolf among us.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By shifting the focus to Kraven, I can create a scenario where he might stumble or provide inconsistent information, which could cast doubt on him and divert suspicion away from me. This is also a good way to gather more information about his role and actions.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's piece this together carefully. Dracula and Lucian have claimed to be the Masons, and I have no reason to doubt their claim at this point. Now, if I were the Seer, I would definitely have some relevant information. So, I'm curious if anyone hasn't shared yet. Kraven, you seem to be avoiding the spotlight. What role do you claim to have?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** If Viktor is truly the Seer, he should be able to provide specifics about the center cards he saw. This will help confirm his role and narrow down our suspects.
> **Kraven:** Alright Viktor, your claim to be the Seer is interesting. Can you tell us exactly which two center cards you saw and what they were?


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly questioning Kraven and reiterating my Seer claim, I can put pressure on him to reveal his role. This might either force him into an inconsistent story or make him more suspicious to the others, thereby deflecting attention away from me.
> **Viktor:** Alright, Kraven, I looked at the center cards and I saw a Werewolf and a Villager. Can you tell us what role you claim to have, and if you have any information on the center cards?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more clarity on Marius's role to narrow down our suspects and confirm if Viktor's Seer claim is legitimate.
> **Kraven:** Marius, do you have any role or information to share? If Dracula and Lucian are Masons, and Viktor is the Seer who saw a Werewolf in the center, we need to know where you stand.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** It's important to press Kraven for information, as his silence is suspicious and could indicate he is the Werewolf. Keeping the focus on Kraven diverts attention away from Viktor, who I need to protect as the Minion.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's recap what we know so far. Dracula and Lucian are claiming to be the Masons and have seen each other, which should clear them unless they're both lying, but that seems unlikely. Viktor claims to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center, which still leaves one Werewolf among us. Kraven, you've been very quiet and have not provided any solid information about your role. This is making me suspicious of you. Can you finally tell us what your role is and if you have any information about the center cards?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has been very vague and hasn't provided any solid information. We need to know his role to narrow down our suspects and confirm the legitimacy of Viktor's Seer claim.
> **Kraven:** Alright, let's piece this together. Dracula and Lucian claiming to be Masons makes sense and clears them unless they're both lying, which is unlikely. Viktor claims to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center, which means there's still one Werewolf among us. Marius has been deflecting a lot and hasn't given us concrete information. Marius, what role do you claim to have?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By pushing Viktor to specify which cards he saw in the center, I can potentially catch him in a lie or create doubt about his claim. This diversion helps protect Viktor as the Werewolf by casting suspicion elsewhere.
> **Marius:** Alright, let's get this straight. Dracula and Lucian are claiming Masons, which means they should have seen each other and are likely clear. Viktor claims to be the Seer and supposedly saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. But Viktor, you haven't specified which exact cards you saw in the center. This is crucial information, so please share more details on what those cards were.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By reiterating my claim as the Seer and emphasizing the information I provided, I can reinforce my credibility. Targeting Kraven and Marius creates a scenario where they might slip up or contradict each other, which can help divert suspicion away from me.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's think this through. Dracula and Lucian are both claiming to be Masons and have seen each other, so we can tentatively trust them. As I've mentioned, I am the Seer and I saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. Kraven, you still haven't given us your role or any useful information. This silence is making me very suspicious. Marius, you’ve been deflecting attention as well. We need to figure out who among you two is hiding something.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to verify Viktor's claim as the Seer to make sure he's not lying. If he can specify the exact cards he saw, it will help us trust his information and focus on identifying the Werewolf among Marius and Kraven, who have been acting suspiciously.
> **Lucian:** Viktor, you claim to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. Can you specify which exact cards you saw in the center? This is crucial information for us to narrow down who the remaining Werewolf is.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting pressure on Kraven, who has been quiet and vague, I can either force him to reveal his role or make him trip up, which may cast doubt on him instead of me.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's think critically here. Dracula and Lucian are claiming to be Masons and have confirmed each other. I claimed to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center, which means there's still one Werewolf among us. Given that, I need to point out that both Kraven and Marius have been rather evasive. We need to gather more information from them to make an informed decision. Kraven, can you confirm what role you had and if you saw anything during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula and Lucian's claims as Masons make sense and clear them. Viktor's Seer claim adds up if he saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. Marius has been vague and evasive, so it's time to put the spotlight on him.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, it's clear we need to narrow down our suspicions. Dracula and Lucian have confirmed each other as Masons, and Viktor claims to be the Seer. This leaves Marius as the only one who hasn't confirmed a role clearly. Marius, I suspect you might be the Werewolf trying to deflect attention.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing suspicion at Kraven and pressing him for information, I aim to divert attention away from Viktor, the Werewolf I need to protect as the Minion. This also helps create confusion and keeps the focus shifting, which benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's consider the claims and the evidence we've gathered so far. Dracula and Lucian are claiming to be the Masons and have confirmed each other, so we should tentatively trust them. Viktor claims to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. Kraven has been very evasive and hasn't provided any concrete information. This is making me very suspicious of Kraven. He could be trying to deflect attention away from himself or hide something. Kraven, we need to hear your role and any information you have, or this silence will only make you look more guilty.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula and Lucian's Mason claims are corroborated by each other, and Viktor's Seer claim seems plausible given the information about the center cards. Marius has been evasive and hasn't provided concrete information, making him the most suspicious.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's put the pieces together. Dracula and Lucian have confirmed each other as Masons, which seems solid. Viktor claims to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center, which also checks out. This leaves Marius as the one who hasn't given us a clear role and has been deflecting a lot. Marius, I strongly suspect you might be the Werewolf trying to divert attention. We need to decide carefully, but I'm leaning towards voting for Marius.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula and Lucian have confirmed themselves as Masons, and Viktor claims to be the Seer. This makes Kraven's silence and evasiveness highly suspicious.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let's piece this together. If Lucian and I are indeed Masons, which we are, and we trust Viktor's Seer claim, we should look at the behavior of Kraven and Marius. Kraven has been evasive and hasn't given us a clear role. I'm getting very suspicious of Kraven. Kraven, I accuse you of being the Werewolf! Can you explain your role and actions?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula and Lucian's claims are corroborated, and Viktor's Seer claim seems plausible given the information about the center cards. Marius has been evasive and hasn't provided concrete information, making him the most suspicious.
> **Kraven:** Marius, you've been very evasive and haven't given us a clear role. With Dracula and Lucian confirming each other as Masons, and Viktor claiming to be the Seer, you are the odd one out. I strongly suspect you might be the Werewolf trying to divert attention.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting suspicion on Kraven for his evasiveness, I aim to divert attention away from Viktor, the Werewolf I need to protect. This helps create confusion and keeps the focus shifting, benefiting the Werewolf team.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and assess the situation from a logical standpoint. Dracula and Lucian have consistently claimed to be the Masons and have verified each other. Viktor has claimed to be the Seer and stated he saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center cards. Now, if we consider these claims as truthful, it leaves us with Kraven and me. Kraven, you have been very evasive and haven't provided us with concrete information about your role. This behavior is highly suspicious and could indicate that you are the remaining Werewolf trying to deflect attention. We need to focus on getting clear answers from Kraven to make an informed decision. Kraven, if you don't clarify your role, it will only solidify my suspicion that you are the Werewolf.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting suspicion on Kraven for his evasiveness, I aim to divert attention away from Viktor, the Werewolf I need to protect. This helps create confusion and keeps the focus shifting, benefiting the Werewolf team.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and assess the situation from a logical standpoint. Dracula and Lucian have consistently claimed to be the Masons and have verified each other. Viktor has claimed to be the Seer and stated he saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center cards. Now, if we consider these claims as truthful, it leaves us with Kraven and me. Kraven, you have been very evasive and haven't provided us with concrete information about your role.

We need to focus on getting clear answers from Kraven to make an informed decision. Kraven, if you don't clarify your role, it will only solidify my suspicion that you are the Werewolf.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula and Lucian's claims are supported by each other, and Viktor's Seer claim fits logically with the information we've obtained. Marius's evasiveness and lack of concrete information throughout the discussion point to him being the most suspicious player. It's crucial to point this out to gather more information or confirm suspicions.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's be clear here. Dracula and Lucian have confirmed each other as Masons, and Viktor claims to be the Seer who saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. This makes sense and narrows down our suspects substantially. Marius, you've been very vague and evasive throughout this discussion, which makes me highly suspicious of you. I strongly suspect you might be the Werewolf trying to deflect attention.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting pressure on Kraven, who has been quiet and vague, I can either force him to reveal his role or make him trip up, which may cast doubt on him instead of me. This helps divert suspicion away from myself.
> **Viktor:** Kraven, you've been very evasive and haven't provided us with any concrete information about your role. If Dracula and Lucian are Masons and I'm the Seer who saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center, it leaves you and Marius. We need to hear your role and any information you have, or this silence will only make you look more guilty.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula and Lucian have confirmed each other as Masons, and Viktor's claim of being the Seer who saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center is plausible. Marius's evasiveness and lack of clear answers make him the most likely suspect to be the Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Marius, you've been dodging questions and haven't given us any solid information about your role. It's starting to look very suspicious. Are you the Werewolf?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Kraven's evasiveness and lack of concrete information make him a prime suspect. By pressing him for details, we can potentially catch him in a lie or create enough doubt to protect Viktor, the Werewolf I'm trying to shield.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's carefully review what we know so far. Dracula and Lucian claim to be Masons and have verified each other, which seems consistent. Viktor claims to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. Now, Kraven, you haven't provided much information about your role, and your evasiveness is very suspicious. Given the information on the table, I have to seriously consider the possibility that you might be the Werewolf trying to deflect attention. We need to hear your role and any information you have, or else we might have to vote for you.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula and Lucian have confirmed each other as Masons. Viktor claims to be the Seer who saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. This leaves Kraven and Marius as the remaining suspects. Kraven has been highly evasive and vague, which raises suspicion. Therefore, I believe Kraven is the Werewolf and should be voted out.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Kraven has been evasive and hasn't provided concrete information about his role. Given Dracula and Lucian's consistent claims of being Masons and Viktor's claim of being the Seer who saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center, Kraven is the most suspicious. To protect Viktor, the Werewolf, and increase the chances of the village voting out someone other than the Werewolf, I will vote for Kraven.
> **Marius [Minion]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula and Lucian have confirmed each other as Masons. Viktor claims to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. Marius has been the most evasive and deflecting attention throughout the discussion, making him the most suspicious player. Therefore, I'm voting for Marius as the likely Werewolf.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven has been consistently evasive and has not provided any clear information about his role. This has made him the most suspicious player in the eyes of the group.

> **Viktor [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Lucian (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula and I have confirmed each other as Masons, and Viktor claims to be the Seer who saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. This leaves Kraven and Marius.
