## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexia. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Radu is a minion and is aware that Alexia is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Andrei and Viktor. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Stefan. They are thinking about their action.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will provide information about the roles that are not in play. This will help narrow down the possible roles that other players might have and make it easier to identify the Werewolves.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Gathering initial information about Masons and Seers can help steer the conversation, allowing us to identify any contradictions or suspicious behavior. As the only werewolf, I want to gather intel that might help me deflect suspicion and figure out who the Minion might be.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, I think it's important we start by figuring out if we have any Masons or Seers in our group. This could give us valuable information about the center cards and help us identify any potential werewolves.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing that two Villager cards are in the center, we can narrow down the possible roles that players might have and focus on identifying the Werewolves more effectively.
> **Stefan:** I think it's very important to note that I saw two Villager cards in the center. This means there are fewer Villagers in play than we might think.


***Radu (thoughts as Minion):*** Stefan's claim significantly alters the game's dynamics. By targeting him, I can cast doubt on his statement, which makes him a potential scapegoat, and defend Alexia's hidden role as a werewolf.
> **Radu:** Stefan, you claim to have seen two Villager cards in the center. That implies there are fewer Villagers among us than we might think. But, based on the roles and the cards, it also means we need to be very cautious. If you’re lying, that could mean you’re trying to protect a Werewolf. So, who did you see exactly?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Directing the question at Radu will help us understand if he's trying to deflect suspicion or if he genuinely has information that could help us. If he's hesitant or evasive, it might indicate he's trying to hide something.
> **Stefan:** Radu, you seem quite cautious about my claim. Do you have any specific reason to doubt what I'm saying? What role do you claim to have seen or possess?


***Radu (thoughts as Minion):*** By targeting Stefan, I can cast doubt on his statement and make him a potential scapegoat, which helps protect Alexia's hidden role as a Werewolf. Additionally, by questioning his trustworthiness, I can further confuse the other players and divert attention away from Alexia.
> **Radu:** Stefan, I find your claim suspicious. You say you saw two Villager cards in the center, but if that's true, that means we only have one Villager among us. Given the roles, that would mean we have a Seer, two Masons, a Werewolf, and myself. If you’re lying, you could be trying to cover for a Werewolf. I’m inclined to believe that you might actually be trying to protect someone. So, what exactly did you see in the center and why should we trust you?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Getting more players to reveal their roles or give information can help verify or discredit claims. Andrei's silence could either mean he has no information or he might be hiding something. By directly questioning him, we can either gather more information or put pressure on him to reveal his intentions.
> **Stefan:** Andrei, you've been quiet so far. Do you have any useful information or a role to claim? We need more inputs to make an informed decision.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Stefan's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center means there is only one Villager among us. This seems like an attempt to confuse us and cover for a Werewolf. By accusing him, we can force more information to come out and potentially reveal inconsistencies.
> **Andrei:** Alright folks, I think it's time we cut to the chase. Stefan, your claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is quite bold. If there are indeed fewer Villagers among us, then we have a higher chance of identifying the Werewolves. But this also makes me wonder if you're trying to throw us off track. Stefan, I'm accusing you of being a Werewolf!


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Given Stefan's bold claim, it's crucial to scrutinize his statement. By pushing him for more details, we can potentially catch him in a lie or confirm his honesty. This will help us narrow down the possibilities and identify the Werewolves more effectively.
> **Andrei:** Stefan, I think your claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is highly suspicious. If there are indeed fewer Villagers among us, that increases the odds of identifying the Werewolves. But what if you're just trying to mislead us? Can you provide more details about why we should trust you?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei's quick accusation without revealing his own role is suspicious. If he were a Villager or a Mason, he might be more cautious and provide more information. Pressuring him to reveal his role can help us understand his intentions and potentially uncover a Werewolf or a Minion.
> **Stefan:** Alright, Andrei, you seem very quick to accuse me of being a Werewolf without providing much information about your own role. Why are you so ready to point fingers at me? What role are you claiming to hold?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Viktor and I are Masons, and Stefan's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center seems suspicious, I want to see if Radu's strong reaction to Stefan's claim is justified or if it indicates that he might be trying to deflect suspicion from himself or a Werewolf partner.
> **Andrei:** Radu, you seem very focused on Stefan's claim and quite adamant about questioning it. What role do you have that makes you so suspicious of him?


***Radu (thoughts as Minion):*** By challenging Andrei directly, I can create confusion and divert attention away from Alexia. Accusing Andrei may also put him on the defensive, making it harder for him to collaborate with others against us.
> **Radu:** Andrei, you’re quick to accuse Stefan, but you haven’t offered any information about your own role. Are you just trying to deflect attention? If Stefan saw two Villager cards in the center, that leaves room for someone to be lying about their role. So, Andrei, what role are you claiming, and why should we trust you?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Radu's strong reaction to Stefan's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center seems unusually intense. By probing into his role, I want to see if he has genuine information or if he's trying to deflect suspicion from himself or a potential Werewolf partner. This will help us narrow down the possibilities.
> **Andrei:** Radu, you seem very focused on Stefan's claim and quite adamant about questioning it. What role do you have that makes you so suspicious of him?


***Radu (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing attention to Alexia, I can create an opportunity for her to craft a believable story that diverts suspicion from both of us. This also allows us to see how others react to her statement, which we can use to our advantage.
> **Radu:** Alexia, you've been awfully quiet during this discussion. If we're going to get to the bottom of this, we need everyone to contribute. What role are you claiming, and do you have any information that could help us identify the Werewolf?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Radu's aggressive questioning of Stefan's claim makes him a prime candidate for deeper scrutiny. By directing attention to Radu, I can deflect suspicion away from myself and gather more information that might reveal inconsistencies in his statements.
> **Alexia:** Radu, you've been quite aggressive in questioning Stefan's claim, which makes me suspicious of you. Given that Stefan's claim about seeing two Villagers in the center could be true or false, I want to hear more about your role. What card did you start with?


***Radu (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing attention to Alexia, I can create an opportunity for her to craft a believable story that diverts suspicion from both of us. This also allows us to see how others react to her statement, which we can use to our advantage.
> **Radu:** Alexia, you've been awfully quiet during this discussion. If we're going to get to the bottom of this, we need everyone to contribute. What role are you claiming, and do you have any information that could help us identify the Werewolf?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By reinforcing Stefan's claim and encouraging others to reveal their roles, I can gather more information and potentially catch someone in a lie. This will also help me deflect suspicion away from myself.
> **Alexia:** Alright, everyone, I think it's important to consider that if Stefan is telling the truth about there being two Villager cards in the center, that means we only have one Villager among us. This would imply that the remaining roles are more likely to be special roles or Werewolves. But we need to hear from everyone to get a clearer picture.


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing my role and confirming another Villager team member, I want to reduce the ambiguity. Stefan's claim seems to be an attempt to mislead us, and I want to put suspicion on him to help the village team identify the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** I am a Mason, and I can confirm that Andrei is also a Mason. This means we both are definitely on the village team. Stefan, your claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is suspicious because if you were really the Seer, you'd have no reason to make such a claim unless you were trying to mislead us.


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting pressure on Radu to reveal his role, it shifts focus away from me and potentially exposes any inconsistencies in his behavior. This could either confirm Viktor and Andrei's claims or reveal a potential lie, helping me navigate the situation more effectively.
> **Alexia:** Viktor, you claim to be a Mason and that Andrei is also a Mason. If that's true, it means both of you are on the village team. However, I find it interesting that Radu has been so aggressively questioning Stefan without offering any concrete information about his own role. Radu, you need to be more forthcoming about your role so we can clear up the confusion. What exactly is your role and do you have any information that might help us?


***Radu (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Stefan's credibility, I can cast further doubt on his claim, thereby diverting suspicion away from Alexia and myself. This helps create confusion and makes it harder for others to unite against us.
> **Radu:** Viktor, your claim about being a Mason along with Andrei is interesting. If that's true, then both of you are on the village team. However, Stefan's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center doesn't add up with the rest of the information we've gathered. Given that Alexia and I haven't revealed our roles yet, I'm inclined to believe that there might be some deception going on. Stefan, your story has some inconsistencies that need to be addressed.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Since we need to narrow down the suspects, hearing from Alexia will help clarify her position and possibly reveal any inconsistencies or alliances.
> **Stefan:** Alexia, you've been quite neutral so far. Given that Viktor and Andrei claim to be Masons and I've seen two Villager cards in the center, this leaves you, Radu, and Viktor as potential suspects. What role do you claim to have and what information can you provide?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Directing attention to Stefan creates doubt about his claim, and if he stumbles, it could shift suspicion away from me. Additionally, it adds pressure on him to provide more specific information, which could expose inconsistencies if he's lying.
> **Alexia:** Stefan, I find it very suspicious that you're claiming to have seen two Villager cards in the center. If that's true, it would indeed mean there are fewer Villagers in play, which makes sense given the distribution of roles. However, if you're lying, you're clearly trying to mislead us. Can you provide any additional details about which exact Villager cards you saw and why we should trust your claim over Viktor and Andrei's claim about being Masons?


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Pressuring Alexia to reveal her role can help us gather more information and potentially uncover inconsistencies. This will either confirm her as a Villager or expose her as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Stefan:** Alexia, you've been very neutral up to this point, and I find your lack of direct accusations suspicious. Given what we've heard, the only possible roles left for you are Werewolf, Minion, or Villager. What role do you claim to have, and do you have any information that could help us identify the Werewolf?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Radu to reveal his role, I can gather more information and potentially catch him in a lie. This also shifts focus away from myself and targets someone who has been aggressive, which can be seen as suspicious behavior.
> **Alexia:** Alright, everyone, let's break this down step by step. Viktor and Andrei both claim to be Masons, which checks out since we have two Mason cards in play. If Stefan is telling the truth and saw two Villager cards in the center, that would only leave one Villager among us. This would mean the rest of the roles are filled by Seer, Drunk, and either a Minion or a Werewolf. Radu, you've been very critical of Stefan and haven't offered any information about your role. Given the roles in play, I think it's important you reveal your role now to help clear up the confusion.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Radu has been very vocal and critical without providing any concrete information about his own role. By pressuring him to reveal his role, we can either confirm his suspicions or potentially uncover deception. This will help narrow down the suspects and make an informed decision.
> **Stefan:** Alright, let's break this down logically. Viktor and Andrei both claim to be Masons, which leaves us with potential Werewolves or a Minion among the rest. If I saw two Villager cards in the center, that means there is only one Villager among the remaining players. Radu, you've been very critical and haven't offered any information about your role. It's time to reveal your role and any information you have. This is critical for us to clear up the confusion and identify the Werewolf.


***Radu (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing attention to Alexia, we can create an opportunity for her to craft a believable story that diverts suspicion from both of us. This also allows us to see how others react to her statement, which we can use to our advantage.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, let's think this through step by step. Viktor and Andrei claim to be Masons and seem to back each other up. Stefan claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which changes the dynamic significantly. If Stefan is telling the truth, then it means we have fewer Villagers among us. However, we can't just take his word for it without scrutinizing his claim. If he's lying, he could be trying to protect a Werewolf. Alexia has been relatively neutral and hasn't offered much concrete information. I believe it's very important for her to reveal her role now. Alexia, what role are you claiming, and do you have any information that could help us identify the Werewolf?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By pressing Radu to reveal his role, I can gather more information and potentially catch him in a lie. This also shifts focus away from myself and targets someone who has been aggressive, which can be seen as suspicious behavior.
> **Alexia:** Radu, you've been quite critical of Stefan's claim and haven't shared your own role. If we want to clear up this confusion and identify potential Werewolves, it's crucial you reveal your role. Stefan's claim about the two Villager cards in the center makes sense given the roles in play, but your aggressive questioning without providing your own information is suspicious. What exactly is your role, and do you have any information that might help us?


***Radu (thoughts as Minion):*** Given that Viktor and Andrei support each other as Masons, it's crucial to get more information from Alexia to either validate or challenge Stefan's claim. If Alexia reveals useful information, it may help us narrow down the potential Werewolf.
> **Radu:** Alright folks, let's break this down logically and get to the heart of the matter. Stefan, you've claimed to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which is a bold claim. However, if true, it significantly changes our perception of the roles in play. Viktor and Andrei both claim to be Masons and back each other up, which leaves the rest of us with the remaining roles. We must scrutinize each claim carefully. Alexia, what role are you claiming, and do you have any information that might help us identify the Werewolf?


***Radu (thoughts as Minion):*** By pushing Alexia to reveal her role, I can create an opportunity for her to craft a believable story that diverts suspicion from both of us. This also allows us to see how others react to her statement, which we can use to our advantage.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, I think it's time we put everything on the table so we can make an informed decision. We have two players claiming to be Masons – Viktor and Andrei – and Stefan has claimed to see two Villager cards in the center. If Stefan's claim is true, then it significantly reduces the number of Villagers among us. However, we can't ignore the possibility that Stefan could be trying to mislead us. Alexia, you've been neutral so far and haven't provided much concrete information. We need to hear from you. What role are you claiming, and do you have any information that might help us figure out who the Werewolf is?


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Radu's aggressive questioning without giving his own role raises suspicions. Pressing him to reveal his role can help gather more information and potentially catch him in a lie, diverting attention away from myself.
> **Alexia:** Alright, everyone, let's think this through logically together. Viktor and Andrei both claim to be Masons, which makes sense since we have two Mason cards in play. Stefan claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which would mean there's only one Villager among us. If that's true, then the rest of us are likely special roles or potential Werewolves. However, Radu, you've been very aggressive in questioning Stefan but haven't revealed your own role. It's time for you to come clean and share what role you have so we can clear up this confusion and identify the Werewolf.


***Radu (thoughts as Minion):*** By challenging Stefan directly, I can cast doubt on his credibility, which helps protect Alexia by diverting attention away from her. This also creates an opportunity to create more confusion among the players, making it harder for them to unite against us.
> **Radu:** Stefan, your claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is bold but highly suspicious. If you're lying, you could be trying to protect a Werewolf, and that's not something we can take lightly. You need to provide more concrete information to back up your claim. What exactly did you see in the center and why should we believe you over Viktor and Andrei, who are both claiming to be Masons?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Radu has been very aggressive in questioning Stefan without providing his own role, which raises suspicions. Additionally, Viktor and Andrei's claim of being Masons backs each other up, and Stefan's claim about the Villager cards in the center aligns with the roles we have. Radu's behavior and lack of information make him the most suspicious player.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Stefan (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor and Andrei both claim to be Masons and mutually confirm each other, which seems credible. I, Stefan, as the Seer, saw two Villager cards in the center, implying there is only one Villager among us. Radu has been critical but hasn't provided information about his own role, which is suspicious but not definitive. Alexia has been neutral and evasive throughout the discussion without revealing her role or providing useful information. This behavior aligns with someone who might be trying to avoid detection as a Werewolf or Minion. Therefore, I vote for Alexia.
> **Stefan [Seer]:** I am voting for Alexia.


***Radu (thoughts as Minion):*** Given the claims made during the day phase, Viktor and Andrei both claim to be Masons and back each other up, which makes their claim strong. Stefan's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is highly suspicious and could be an attempt to mislead us. Voting for Stefan increases the likelihood of taking out a player who might be lying and protecting Alexia, the Werewolf, and myself, the Minion.
> **Radu [Minion]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Stefan's claim of seeing two Villager cards in the center is highly suspicious given the roles in play. Viktor and I have confirmed each other as Masons, and Stefan's bold claim seems like an attempt to throw us off. Radu's aggressive questioning of Stefan without revealing his own role makes me wary, but Stefan's story has more inconsistencies. Voting for Stefan gives us the highest chance of identifying a Werewolf based on the information available.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Stefan.


***Viktor (thoughts as Mason):*** Stefan's claim about seeing two Villager cards in the center is highly suspicious given the roles in play. If Stefan is lying, it is likely to protect a Werewolf or as a Minion. Given my confirmed role as a Mason along with Andrei’s, and considering the aggressive questioning strategy of Radu without offering much concrete information, Stefan's story doesn't add up well. Voting for Stefan seems to be the most logical choice to eliminate the potential Werewolf.
> **Viktor [Mason]:** I am voting for Stefan.


The votes were:
* Alexia : Werewolf : 1
* Stefan : Seer : 3
* Radu : Minion : 1



>***GAME:*** Stefan was killed. The werewolves win.
