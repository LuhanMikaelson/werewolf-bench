## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Lucian. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Dragos is a minion and is aware that Lucian is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Alexandra. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Kraven. They are thinking about their action.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather information about roles that are not in play, which can help narrow down the possible roles of the other players. This information can be crucial during the DAY phase when trying to identify the Werewolves or confirm the Villagers.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Claiming to be a Mason can help build trust with the real Mason if they are present. This also provides a foundation to cast doubt on others and steer suspicion away from myself as the lone Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's get to the bottom of this. I am a Mason and I saw the other Mason last night. This means we have a strong village team. Who else has information to share?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As the true Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. Since Lucian is falsely claiming to be a Mason, he must be trying to mislead us, likely because he is on the Werewolf team.
> **Alexandra:** Hold up everyone, something isn't right here. Lucian just claimed to be a Mason and saw another Mason last night. But I am the real Mason and I didn't see anyone. That means Lucian is lying and trying to mislead us. Lucian, are you the Werewolf or the Minion?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By suggesting that Alexandra might be mistaken or that there's another explanation, I can create doubt and redirect attention away from myself. Encouraging other players to share their information first may give me more opportunities to build a defense.
> **Lucian:** Hold on, Alexandra. If you're claiming to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, that just means the other Mason card is in the center. It's not proof that I'm lying. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let's try to verify other roles first. Did anyone else see anything last night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing that I saw two Villagers in the center, it helps confirm that Lucian and Alexandra could both be telling the truth about being Masons, but one of them must be lying. Additionally, it informs others that there are no extra Villagers, thereby helping to identify false claims.
> **Kraven:** I have some important information to share. Last night, I used my ability to look at two of the center cards, and both were Villagers. This means there are no additional Villagers left in the center and all other roles are in play among us. This should help us narrow down who might be lying about their roles.


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** Since there's a discrepancy between Lucian and Alexandra, understanding more about the center cards can help us determine who might be lying. If Kraven confirms the center cards, it can support Lucian's claim and put more suspicion on Alexandra.
> **Dragos:** Alright, let's think about this logically, everyone. Lucian claims to be a Mason and saw another Mason, which would mean both Masons are in play. Alexandra claims to be a Mason and didn't see anyone, which suggests the other Mason card is in the center. This contradiction needs to be resolved. I think Lucian's claim holds more weight because if Alexandra were lying, she'd be the Werewolf or Minion. Kraven, could you tell us more about which center cards you saw and how confident you are about them being Villagers?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** We need more details on Lucian's claim. If he hesitates or gives vague information, it might indicate that he's not being truthful. Dragos's quick alignment with Lucian is also suspicious.
> **Kraven:** Hold on, Dragos. You seem to be siding with Lucian pretty quickly. Given the contradiction between Lucian and Alexandra, we need to resolve this carefully. Lucian could easily be the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf. Lucian, if you're truly a Mason, tell us more about the other Mason you saw last night. Who was it?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting attention to Dragos, I can divert suspicion away from myself and potentially gather more information. This also puts pressure on Dragos to reveal his role, which can help me further manipulate the situation.
> **Lucian:** Alright, let's break this down carefully. Kraven, you said you saw two Villager cards in the center, right? That suggests the Villager roles are accounted for. Alexandra, you claim you're the Mason and didn't see anyone else. This means the other Mason card is in the center. But I know I'm a Mason and saw the other Mason last night. This leaves a discrepancy that needs to be resolved. Dragos, you haven't said much yet. Can you share if you have any special role or information that might help us clarify this situation?


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** By supporting Lucian's claim and casting doubt on Alexandra, I aim to protect the Werewolf (Lucian) and shift the suspicion away from him. This approach also aligns with the information given by Kraven, which supports Lucian's narrative.
> **Dragos:** Alright, let's think this through meticulously. Lucian claims to be a Mason and saw another Mason, which could mean both Masons are indeed in play. Alexandra, you claim you're a Mason and didn't see anyone, suggesting the other Mason card is in the center. Given Kraven's statement about seeing two Villagers in the center, it's more likely that Lucian is telling the truth. If we assume Lucian is the true Mason, then Alexandra must be either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to deceive us. Kraven, your information about the center cards being Villagers adds weight to Lucian's claim. So, if we're looking for deception, Alexandra's claim seems the most suspicious. What do you all think?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** By pushing for more clarity, we can better understand who might be lying. Right now, the contradiction between Lucian and Alexandra is the biggest issue we need to address.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, we need to resolve the contradiction between Lucian and Alexandra. If Lucian is truly the Mason and saw another Mason, then Alexandra's claim doesn't hold up. However, if Alexandra is the Mason and didn't see anyone, it suggests the other Mason card is in the center. We need more clarity.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Marius and getting him to reveal his role, I can gather more information and potentially divert suspicion away from myself. This can also help me adjust my strategy based on the new information provided by Marius.
> **Lucian:** Marius, you've been pretty quiet so far. Can you share if you have any special role or information that might help us clarify this situation? We need all the information we can get.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to verify the information about the center cards to resolve the contradiction between Lucian and Alexandra.
> **Marius:** Kraven, you said you saw two Villagers in the center. Can you clarify which specific cards you saw?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's insistent claim of seeing another Mason is contradicted by Alexandra's more plausible explanation. My seeing two Villagers in the center supports that there might only be one Mason in play. We need to press Lucian for more information to catch any inconsistencies.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, you're the one making the boldest claims here, and it's not adding up. You said you saw another Mason, but Alexandra's account makes more sense with the center cards being Villagers. If you're really a Mason, give us more details or admit you're lying!


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting suspicion on Alexandra and suggesting she might be the Minion, I can redirect attention away from myself. This strategy also allows me to gather more information from Marius, which could help me adjust my defense.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's think about this carefully. Alexandra claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which means the other Mason card could be in the center. However, if we believe Kraven's claim about seeing two Villagers in the center, then it suggests the Villager roles are accounted for. This leaves a discrepancy because if both Masons are in play, Alexandra's story doesn't add up. I strongly believe that Alexandra might be the Minion trying to protect a hidden Werewolf. Let's hear more from Marius to see if he has any insights.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's claim about the center cards being Villagers directly impacts the credibility of other roles in play. We need more details to verify his information and determine if he's being truthful or trying to mislead us.
> **Alexandra:** Kraven, I'm not convinced by your claim about seeing two Villagers in the center. Can you be more specific about which cards you saw and why we should trust you?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra's claim makes more sense with the center cards being Villagers. We need to press Lucian for more information to catch any inconsistencies.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, your claim about seeing another Mason is very suspicious. Given that I saw two Villagers in the center, it's more likely that only one Mason is actually in play. Alexandra's explanation fits better with the information we have. I strongly suspect Lucian might be the Minion trying to protect a hidden Werewolf. Can you give us more details or admit you're lying?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Kraven's claim, I can redirect suspicion away from myself and possibly expose inconsistencies in his story. This also helps keep the focus away from the Mason contradiction, buying me more time to adjust my strategy.
> **Lucian:** Kraven, your claim about seeing two Villagers in the center is quite convenient, don't you think? Especially considering that we have a contradiction between myself and Alexandra about the Mason role. If you saw two Villagers, that leaves us with fewer Villager roles among us. Are you completely certain about what you saw, or is there a possibility you're mistaken?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's claim is contradictory to the evidence I have about the center cards. If both Villagers are in the center, it's unlikely there are two Masons in play. Pressing Lucian to clarify his story might expose inconsistencies and reveal his true role.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, you're making some bold claims about seeing another Mason, but your story doesn't add up with the information we have. I saw two Villagers in the center, which means there can only be one Mason in play. I suspect you're either the Werewolf or the Minion. Can you explain how your story fits with the center cards?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing attention to Marius and getting him to reveal his role, I can gather more information and potentially divert suspicion away from myself. This can also help me adjust my strategy based on the new information provided by Marius.
> **Lucian:** Alright, let's break this down carefully. Alexandra claims to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which suggests the other Mason card could be in the center. However, if Kraven saw two Villagers in the center, that means no additional Villagers are in play. This leaves a discrepancy. I strongly believe Alexandra might be the Minion trying to protect a hidden Werewolf. Marius, you've been pretty quiet so far. Can you share if you have any special role or information that might help us clarify this situation?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Given the information provided, Lucian's story about seeing another Mason makes more sense if Kraven's claim about the center cards is true. Alexandra's claim contradicts this, making her look more suspicious.
> **Marius:** Alexandra, something about your claim doesn't add up. If you were truly a Mason and didn't see another Mason, and considering Kraven's claim about seeing two Villagers in the center, it seems more likely that you're trying to divert suspicion. Are you the Minion or the Werewolf?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's claim of seeing two Villagers in the center contradicts my knowledge as the only Mason, as well as the general distribution of the roles. This makes me suspect that Kraven is trying to protect a Werewolf by creating confusion.
> **Alexandra:** Kraven, I find your story about the two Villagers in the center suspicious. If the other Mason card is in the center, it means there should be at least one Villager missing from the roles in play. Your information doesn't add up. Are you trying to mislead us as the Minion?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's claim is contradictory to the evidence I have about the center cards. If both Villagers are in the center, it's unlikely there are two Masons in play. Pressing Lucian to clarify his story might expose inconsistencies and reveal his true role.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, your claim about seeing another Mason just doesn't add up with the evidence we have. I saw two Villagers in the center, which means there can only be one Mason in play. I'm strongly suspecting you're either the Werewolf or the Minion. Can you explain how your story fits with the center cards?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking everyone to clarify their roles, I aim to gather more information and potentially catch someone in a lie. This also buys time and shifts some focus away from the Mason contradiction.
> **Lucian:** Alright everyone, let's piece this together step by step. Kraven claims he saw two Villagers in the center, which, if true, means that the Villager roles among us are accounted for and any claims to Villager roles among us are false. This makes things tricky. If Alexandra is truly a Mason and didn't see another Mason, it suggests one Mason is in the center. But that doesn't align with my claim. Can we get more clarity on what roles everyone is claiming? This might help us find inconsistencies.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to gather more information from all players, and Marius hasn't contributed much yet. His insights might help us resolve the contradiction between Lucian and Alexandra.
> **Kraven:** Marius, you've been really quiet. What role are you claiming and do you have any information that might help us figure out who's lying?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** By pushing Dragos to reveal his role or provide information, we can gain more clarity. His silence could be a strategic move to avoid suspicion, and we need all available information to resolve the contradictions between Lucian and Alexandra.
> **Marius:** Dragos, you've been unusually quiet and seem to be playing it safe. It's time to hear your role and any information you have.


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** By bringing everyone back to the central contradiction and subtly casting doubt on both Kraven and Alexandra, I aim to protect Lucian while spreading the suspicion. This approach also pressures Marius to reveal his role or information, which might further help in shifting the focus away from Lucian.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, I think we need to carefully analyze the information we've got so far. Lucian claims to be a Mason and saw another Mason. Alexandra claims to be a Mason but didn't see anyone, suggesting the other Mason card is in the center. Kraven claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, which means the Villager roles among us are accounted for. This leaves us with a major contradiction. Could it be that one of you is the Minion trying to protect a hidden Werewolf? Marius, you've been pretty quiet. Do you have any special role or information that might help us clarify this situation?


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** By asking Marius directly, I can potentially gather more information or shift the focus towards him, which may help protect Lucian and create further confusion among the other players.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's think about this step by step. Lucian claims to be a Mason and saw another Mason, which implies both Masons should be in play. On the other hand, Alexandra claims to be a Mason but didn't see anyone, which suggests the other Mason card is in the center. Kraven claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, which would mean no additional Villagers are in play among us. This leaves us with a major contradiction. Marius, you've been pretty quiet. Do you have any special role or information that might help us clarify this situation?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** We have to determine who's lying between Lucian and Alexandra. If Kraven's claim about the center cards is accurate, then Lucian's statement about seeing another Mason doesn't add up. It's important to focus on these contradictions to identify the Werewolves or Minion.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's break this down step by step and try to figure out the truth. We have a major contradiction between Lucian and Alexandra about the Mason role. Given that Kraven claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, it suggests that the Villager roles are accounted for and the other roles are among us. If we consider Kraven's information to be true, it means only one Mason card is in play, which aligns with Alexandra's claim. But this contradicts Lucian's claim of seeing another Mason. We need to resolve this contradiction.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's claim of seeing another Mason makes more sense in light of Kraven's statement about the center cards. Alexandra's claim contradicts this, making her look more suspicious. We need to resolve this contradiction by focusing on Alexandra.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, I think it's time to make a decision. Given all the information, I find Alexandra's claim to be the most suspicious. If Lucian truly saw another Mason, then Alexandra's claim doesn't add up. Kraven's information about seeing two Villagers in the center aligns with this. So, I believe Alexandra might be the Minion or the Werewolf.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** If Marius can provide additional details about his role, it could help clarify the discrepancies we're facing. Gathering more information will be key in determining who's lying.
> **Lucian:** Alright, let's dissect the situation. We have conflicting claims about the Mason role. Alexandra, you're saying you didn't see anyone, implying the other Mason card is in the center. But I know I'm a Mason and saw the other Mason. Kraven, you claim to have seen two Villagers in the center, which complicates things because it would mean Villagers are accounted for. This leaves us in a tricky spot. I want to hear more from Marius since he's been quiet and could provide crucial information.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to resolve this contradiction between Lucian and me. Marius, you could provide valuable information to help us determine who is lying.
> **Alexandra:** Marius, you’ve been awfully quiet and seem to be playing it safe. What role are you claiming and do you have any information that might help us figure out who's lying?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Given the conflicting claims about the Mason role, Alexandra's story doesn't add up with the information we have. If Kraven's claim of seeing two Villagers in the center is true, it aligns with my claim of seeing another Mason, making Alexandra's claim more suspicious. Additionally, Marius and Dragos seem to be leaning towards Alexandra being the Minion or Werewolf, so voting for Alexandra increases the chances of aligning with the majority and diverting suspicion away from myself.
> **Lucian [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** As the true Mason, I know that the other Mason card is in the center, contradicting Lucian's claim of seeing another Mason. This discrepancy, combined with Kraven's claim of seeing two Villagers in the center, suggests Lucian is not being truthful. Given the roles in play, Lucian is likely the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Alexandra [Mason]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's claim about seeing another Mason is highly suspicious and contradictory to the information we have. Since I saw two Villager cards in the center, it aligns with Alexandra's claim that the other Mason card is in the center, meaning only one Mason is in play. Lucian's insistence on seeing another Mason suggests he is either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us. Voting for Lucian is the best option to try and eliminate the threat to the village.
> **Kraven [Seer]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Dragos (thoughts as Minion):*** Given that Kraven claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, it supports Lucian's claim that he saw another Mason. Alexandra's story doesn't fit with this information, and she might be the Minion trying to protect a hidden Werewolf. Voting for her increases the chances of protecting Lucian and ensures that the suspicion stays away from him.
> **Dragos [Minion]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** There is a major contradiction between Lucian and Alexandra regarding the Mason role. Lucian claims to be a Mason and saw another Mason, while Alexandra claims to be a Mason but didn't see anyone, suggesting the other Mason card is in the center. This contradicts Lucian's statement. Given that Kraven claims to have seen two Villagers in the center, and if his information is accurate, Lucian's statement of seeing another Mason holds more weight. Additionally, Alexandra's claim contradicts Lucian's and appears more suspicious. Therefore, I believe Alexandra might be the Minion or the Werewolf trying to deceive us.
> **Marius [Villager]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Werewolf : 2
* Alexandra : Mason : 3



>***GAME:*** Alexandra was killed. The werewolves win.
