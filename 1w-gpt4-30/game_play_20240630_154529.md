## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Cristina. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Mircea is a minion and is aware that Cristina is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Viktor. They are thinking about their action.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can verify whether there are any Werewolves or other key roles not in play. This information can help me deduce the roles of other players and steer the conversation during the day phase more effectively.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** By stating this information upfront, we can eliminate Mason claims and focus on other roles to find the Werewolves or Minion. This helps narrow down the possibilities and directs the conversation efficiently.
> **Viktor:** I saw both Mason cards in the center, which means no one here is a Mason.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By highlighting Viktor's statement and suggesting the need for corroboration, I'm trying to create doubt and confusion. This can divert attention away from me and potentially pit the other players against each other.
> **Cristina:** I think it's interesting that Viktor is claiming to have seen both Mason cards in the center. That would mean that either Viktor is telling the truth or he's trying to cover up his real role. If someone else saw some center cards, it would be helpful to corroborate Viktor's claim.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina is questioning Viktor's claim, and it would be helpful to know if she has any information that could either support or refute his statement. This could give us more insight into Viktor's role and help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Cristina, did you see any center cards or another player's card?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking Marius directly, I'm trying to gather more information while also adding layers of interaction that can muddy the waters. This could help create doubt about Viktor's claim and potentially lead to a contradictory statement which we can use to our advantage.
> **Cristina:** Alexandra, I actually didn't get to see any center cards or another player's card. But it seems like Viktor's claim needs some verification. Marius, what did you see?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina hasn't revealed her role yet, and getting her to claim a role might help us determine if Viktor is lying about seeing both Mason cards in the center. If Cristina claims a role that conflicts with the information we have, it can point us towards who might be lying.
> **Marius:** Cristina, if you didn't see any center cards or another player's card, can you tell us what role you claim to have? It might help us piece together the information we have.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming Villager, I'm taking on a relatively safe role that is hard to disprove. I'm also putting pressure on Alexandra to reveal her role, which could potentially create more discrepancies or help me identify the Seer or Minion.
> **Cristina:** Alright, Marius, I see you're asking about my role. Given the current situation, I'm actually going to claim Villager. I know it's not much, but it's the truth from my side. Now, Viktor's claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is interesting. Alexandra, you haven't said much yet. Did you get to see any cards or have any special role?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim needs to be verified or refuted to narrow down our suspicions. By directly questioning him, I can gauge his reaction and possibly catch him in a lie if he's a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra:** Viktor, your claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is pretty bold. If you're telling the truth, that means there are no Masons among us, which narrows it down a bit. But if you're lying, you could be trying to cover up something. So, I have to ask, Viktor, are you sure you're not trying to hide the fact that you might be a Werewolf?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexandra has been very cautious and hasn't claimed her role yet. As the Seer, I know both Mason cards are in the center, so I need to figure out if she's trying to cover up being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor:** Alexandra, your hesitation makes me think you might be hiding something. What role are you claiming?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim about the Masons could be a strategic lie if he's a Werewolf. Marius hasn't provided any information yet, and getting his perspective could help us verify or challenge Viktor's statement.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, Viktor, I'm claiming Villager just like Cristina. But your bold claim does sound a bit suspicious to me. If you really saw both Mason cards in the center, someone else should have seen something to back you up. Marius, what do you think about Viktor's claim?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim is crucial, but it's also potentially misleading. By challenging his claim, we can either expose a lie or confirm his truthfulness. This will help us narrow down the suspects.
> **Marius:** Viktor, your claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is very specific. But there's something odd about it. If you really saw both Mason cards, why didn't you mention which position they were in? Seems like you might be trying to distract us with vague information.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's claim of being a Villager is quite generic and doesn't provide much insight. Pressing her for more details might help us gather more information or catch her in a lie if she's not being honest.
> **Viktor:** Cristina, you're claiming Villager, but we need more information. If you're truly a Villager, it would help to know what you thought or saw during the night phase. Did you hear or notice anything suspicious?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question to Marius, I'm trying to gather more information and keep the spotlight off myself. This strategy also puts pressure on Marius to reveal his role, which could either corroborate or contradict Viktor's bold claim. It also helps in identifying inconsistencies among the players' statements.
> **Cristina:** Alright, everyone, let's take a moment to think this through carefully. Viktor's claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is quite significant. If it's true, we can eliminate the Mason role from our considerations. However, if Viktor is lying, he could be trying to hide his true role, possibly as a Werewolf or even the Minion. Alexandra and I both claimed Villager, and Marius hasn't given us his role yet. Marius, we need to hear from you. What role are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim is pivotal, but it also raises suspicion because it's a convenient way to eliminate the Mason role. By directly questioning him, we might uncover inconsistencies or force him to reveal more information, which could help identify his true role.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. Viktor's claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center doesn't sit well with me. It's a very convenient way to remove a whole role from consideration. Cristina and Alexandra have claimed Villager, but nobody has verified anything yet. Viktor, you're being awfully defensive. Are you sure you're not trying to hide something?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius is being very suspicious and hasn't claimed a role. We need him to provide more information so we can piece together the roles and find the Werewolves or Minion. My claim about the Mason cards is true, so pressing him will help us determine if he's hiding something.
> **Viktor:** Alright, listen up everyone! Cristina and Alexandra both claimed Villager without offering much to back it up. Marius hasn't given us his role yet, and he's being pretty skeptical of my claim. I know that both Mason cards are in the center, which means no one here is a Mason. So, let's narrow this down. If you're truly a Villager, Marius, you need to tell us what you saw or heard during the night. This is critical.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim is bold but possible. Cristina's quickness to question Viktor without showing her own cards makes her look suspicious. It's time to put some pressure on her to see how she reacts.
> **Marius:** Alright, let's get serious here. Viktor, your claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is really convenient. It could be a tactic to eliminate a role that could challenge you. Cristina and Alexandra, you both claimed Villager. But Cristina, I noticed you were quick to point fingers at Viktor without really providing any solid information. That seems a bit suspicious to me. I think you're hiding something.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By suggesting logical evaluation and encouraging open discussion, I'm trying to cast doubt on Viktor's claim without making myself seem too suspicious. This helps create a more complex situation where others might start questioning Viktor and Marius, rather than focusing on me.
> **Cristina:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and think about this logically. Viktor's claim about both Mason cards being in the center is pretty bold, but it's also a very convenient way to try to guide our suspicions away from him. If Viktor is telling the truth, that would mean he's the Seer and he saw the center cards. But if he's lying, he could very well be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect a Werewolf. We need to consider these possibilities carefully. Alexandra and I both claimed Villager, which is a safe claim but doesn't offer much information. Marius hasn't given us his role yet, so we should hear from him. I suggest we all share our thoughts more openly so we can piece this puzzle together.


***Mircea (thoughts as Minion):*** We need to get everyone to reveal their roles to piece together the puzzle. By putting pressure on Marius, who has been very skeptical, we can gather more information and potentially expose inconsistencies.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, let's stop and think for a moment. Viktor's claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is very bold and specific, which makes me inclined to believe he might actually be telling the truth. If that's the case, we can eliminate the Mason role entirely. Cristina and Alexandra both claiming Villager is safe but doesn't give us much. Marius, I noticed you've been pushing back against Viktor's claim heavily. If you have a solid role, now would be the time to reveal it, because your skepticism alone isn't helping. What role are you claiming, Marius?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina was quick to challenge Viktor without offering substantial evidence or insight. This could be a tactic to divert suspicion from herself. By pressing her, we may uncover inconsistencies or force her to reveal more useful information.
> **Marius:** Viktor, your claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is very convenient and could be a tactic to mislead us. Cristina and Alexandra have both claimed Villager, which doesn't give us much to go on. But Cristina, you were quick to question Viktor without providing any solid information yourself. That seems a bit suspicious to me. Are you sure you're not hiding something?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By asking Viktor for more details, I'm attempting to put pressure on him to verify his claim. This can help create doubt and potentially catch him in a lie, diverting attention away from me. Additionally, this keeps the conversation focused on Viktor, preventing others from scrutinizing my role too closely.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, let's take a moment to consider the roles and claims we've heard so far. Viktor has claimed to see both Mason cards in the center, which is a significant claim. If true, it means there are no Masons among us. Alexandra and I have both claimed Villager, which is a safe role but doesn't provide much information. Marius, you've been very skeptical of Viktor's claim but haven't revealed your own role yet. To move forward, we need to piece together all the information we have. Viktor, can you give us more details about what you saw during the night? Specifically, which positions were the Mason cards in?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina was quick to challenge Viktor without offering substantial evidence or insight. This could be a tactic to divert suspicion from herself. By pressing her, we may uncover inconsistencies or force her to reveal more useful information.
> **Marius:** Cristina, you claimed Villager, but I find your immediate suspicion of Viktor without providing much evidence kind of fishy. Are you sure you're not trying to deflect attention from yourself? What exactly were you thinking when you questioned Viktor so quickly?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By redirecting the spotlight to Marius and questioning his role, I'm helping to create more confusion and doubt among the players. This keeps the focus away from me and pressures Marius to reveal his role, which could potentially expose inconsistencies or contradictions.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and evaluate this carefully. Viktor's claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is quite specific, but as Marius pointed out, he didn't mention the exact positions. This makes it a bit dubious. Alexandra and I have both claimed Villager, which doesn't add much to the discussion. Marius, you've been very skeptical of Viktor but haven't revealed your role yet. If you truly want to help us figure this out, it would be beneficial to know where you stand. What role are you claiming, Marius?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's immediate suspicion of Viktor without providing solid information could be a tactic to divert suspicion from herself. By pressing her, we may uncover inconsistencies or force her to reveal more useful information to help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's focus. Viktor's claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is very specific but also a bit too convenient. Cristina and Alexandra both claiming Villager doesn't give us much to go on. Cristina, you were quick to question Viktor without providing much evidence yourself. That seems suspicious to me. Are you sure you're not trying to deflect attention from yourself? What exactly were you thinking when you questioned Viktor so quickly?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly asking Marius to reveal his role, I'm putting pressure on him to contribute more concrete information. This keeps the focus on him and Viktor, and away from me, while also potentially exposing inconsistencies in their stories.
> **Cristina:** Marius, you've been very skeptical of Viktor's claim, but you still haven't revealed your role. If we want to make sense of all this, it's crucial that you tell us what role you have. Only then can we put all the pieces together and figure out who's lying. So, Marius, what role are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim is pivotal, and knowing the exact positions of the Mason cards could either support his story or expose any inconsistencies. This will help us determine if he's telling the truth or trying to deceive us.
> **Marius:** Viktor, your claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is quite bold and specific, but you never mentioned the exact positions of the cards. Can you tell us which positions the Mason cards were in?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius's reluctance to reveal his role and his constant skepticism towards my claim about the Mason cards make him the most suspicious at this point. If he's hiding something, it might be because he's a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Viktor:** Marius, you're being extremely evasive and haven't even revealed your role yet. This is making me seriously suspicious of you. Are you hiding something? What role are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina was quick to challenge Viktor's bold claim without providing much evidence or insight. This could be a tactic to divert suspicion from herself. By pressing her, we may uncover inconsistencies or force her to reveal more useful information to help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Cristina, your immediate suspicion of Viktor without backing it up with solid information makes me really suspicious of you. Are you hiding something? What was your thought process when you questioned Viktor so quickly?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting pressure on Marius to reveal his role, I'm trying to gather more information that could create discrepancies or contradictions. This keeps the spotlight on him and Viktor, diverting attention away from me.
> **Cristina:** Everyone, let's take a deep breath and think this through. Viktor's claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is very bold. If he's lying, he's either a Werewolf or the Minion. If he's telling the truth, we need to figure out who the Werewolves are among us. Alexandra and I have both claimed Villager, which is a safe claim but doesn't add much evidence. Marius, you've been very skeptical of Viktor but still haven't told us your role. We need more information from you. What role are you claiming?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Knowing the exact positions of the Mason cards could help us verify Viktor's claim. If he's lying, it could expose him as a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us. If he's telling the truth, it would help us eliminate the Mason role and narrow down the suspects.
> **Marius:** Viktor, your claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is very specific, but I'm finding it hard to believe without more details. Can you tell us exactly which positions the Mason cards were in the center?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius has been evasive and hasn't provided any solid information. His behavior is raising red flags, and we need to know if he's hiding something.
> **Viktor:** Marius, your constant skepticism and reluctance to reveal your role make you look extremely suspicious. Are you the Werewolf?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina was quick to challenge Viktor without backing it up with solid evidence. This could be a tactic to divert suspicion from herself. By pressing her, we may uncover inconsistencies or force her to reveal more useful information to help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Cristina, your immediate suspicion of Viktor without giving us much information yourself is very suspicious to me. If you really are a Villager, why haven't you provided more useful information or insight?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius has been evasive and hasn't revealed his role, despite being asked multiple times. His skepticism towards my Seer claim and reluctance to provide useful information make him the most suspicious player. This behavior aligns with someone trying to hide their true role, possibly as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor [Seer]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Marius has been consistently skeptical of Viktor's claim without providing his own role, making him the most suspicious player. Voting for Marius aligns with the general suspicion and increases the chances of diverting focus away from me.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim about seeing both Mason cards in the center is very bold and specific, but he never mentioned the exact positions of the cards. This makes me suspicious that he might be lying to cover up his role as a Werewolf. Additionally, he has been very defensive and evasive when questioned about his claim. Therefore, I believe Viktor is the most likely to be a Werewolf.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Mircea (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect the Werewolf (Cristina) by diverting suspicion away from her. Given the current discussions, Marius has been very skeptical and hasn't revealed his role, making him a potential target. However, Cristina's responses have also raised some suspicion among the group, and voting for her might increase the chances of the village not focusing on her as a Werewolf. Additionally, Cristina voting for herself could throw off the village's suspicions and prevent a clear majority against her.
> **Mircea [Minion]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina was quick to challenge Viktor without providing solid evidence or insight, which seems suspicious. This could be a tactic to divert suspicion from herself. Her hesitation to provide meaningful information despite claiming to be a Villager makes me believe she might be hiding something. Given the information we have, voting for Cristina seems like the best choice to try and eliminate a potential Werewolf.
> **Marius [Villager]:** I am voting for Cristina.


The votes were:
* Viktor : Seer : 1
* Cristina : Werewolf : 2
* Marius : Villager : 2



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Cristina, Marius. The villagers win.
