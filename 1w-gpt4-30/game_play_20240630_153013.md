## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming to be a Mason, I am attempting to build trust and misdirect suspicion away from Selene. It also encourages others to reveal their roles, which could help in identifying potential threats or allies.
> **Larisa:** I want to start by saying that I am one of the Masons. I saw my fellow Mason during the night, and I can confirm that there are no Werewolves among us two. I'm curious to know if anyone else has any claims to make about their roles or if they saw something unusual during the night.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I know Marius is the other Mason, Larisa's claim is suspicious. It's possible she's trying to deceive us, or her card was swapped during the night. We need to clarify this before moving forward.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, it's interesting that you claimed to be a Mason. Actually, I'm a Mason and I can confirm that Marius is the other Mason. This could mean one of two things: either you are lying, or there was some card swapping that we need to consider. We should hear from Marius to confirm this.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claim doesn't match the information I have. Given that I know Kraven and I are Masons, Larisa's claim casts doubt on her intentions. This could mean she's either the Minion or a Werewolf attempting to sow confusion.
> **Marius:** Larisa, I find your claim to be highly suspicious. I know for certain that Kraven and I are the Masons. Are you sure you aren't the Minion trying to protect the real Werewolves?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Marius's and Kraven's claim and suggesting the possibility of card swapping, I attempt to create doubt about the Mason claims. This could lead to confusion and misdirection, helping to protect Selene, the true Werewolf, by diverting attention elsewhere. Additionally, by asking Selene and Viktor to reveal their roles, I hope to gather more information to further my deception.
> **Larisa:** Marius, I find it interesting that both you and Kraven are so quick to jump on my claim. What if there's been some card swapping during the night? We need to consider the possibility that someone may have been moved into a Mason role without knowing it. Additionally, I'd like to hear from Selene and Viktor about their roles and what they saw during the night.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's claim directly contradicts what I know to be true since Kraven and I are the Masons. To get a clearer picture, we need more information from the other players, and Selene hasn't spoken yet.
> **Marius:** Selene, I think it's important we hear from you next. Could you please tell us what role you had and any information you gathered during the night?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Claiming to be the Seer gives me credibility and a reason for having precise knowledge about the center cards. This also aligns with the fact that I'm the only Werewolf, and I know there's no other Werewolf in play, which makes my claim more believable. By giving concrete information, I can steer suspicion away from myself.
> **Selene:** Alright, this is getting interesting. I have some information to share that might help us untangle this mess. I'm the Seer, and during the night, I chose to look at two cards in the center. One of those cards was the Werewolf, confirming that one of the Werewolf cards is indeed in the middle. The other card I saw was a Villager. This means that we only have to worry about a single Werewolf among us or potentially the Minion trying to protect them. We need to be very careful about who we trust.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By stirring the pot and casting doubt on Larisa's claim while asking Viktor for his role, I attempt to bring new information to light, potentially revealing inconsistencies in others' stories. This diversifies the focus away from myself and sows confusion among the players, which benefits my role as a Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Marius and Kraven, you're both claiming to be Masons and accusing Larisa of lying. This is getting really confusing because it's a classic situation of 'he said, she said.' But let me throw a wrench into this: Larisa, you seemed pretty confident and quick to claim Mason, even though two others are saying otherwise. What if you're actually the Minion trying to protect a hidden Werewolf? I'm curious, Viktor, what's your role and do you have any insights into this Mason dispute?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Since I'm a Villager, I need to quickly figure out who's lying. Selene's information, while useful, still can't be verified without cross-referencing other clues. Larisa's immediate claim as a Mason is suspicious because it's contested by two others, which could mean she's the Minion or a Werewolf trying to divert attention. Pressing her for more details might help clarify the situation.
> **Viktor:** Selene, I find your information helpful but also a bit suspicious. You're saying that one Werewolf is definitely in the center and the other card you saw was a Villager. But how can we verify that? It seems too convenient. Also, Larisa, you were the first to claim being a Mason and now Marius and Kraven are both contesting that. This makes me think there's definitely some lying going on here. Larisa, why did you feel the need to claim Mason right away?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Viktor and questioning his role, I'm aiming to divert attention away from Selene and myself, while also putting pressure on Viktor to reveal his role, which might induce mistakes or uncertainty in his story.
> **Larisa:** Viktor, you seem to be casting doubt everywhere without giving us any solid information about your own role. Given Selene's claim as the Seer and her information about one Werewolf being in the center, I think it's highly possible that you're trying to sow confusion as the actual Werewolf. Why haven't you told us what your role is yet?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's immediate claim is contested by both Marius and Kraven, making her role highly questionable. Pressing her for more details might reveal inconsistencies that could help us identify the real Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor:** Larisa, your strong reaction and early claim as a Mason, especially when it's being contested by two others, makes me very suspicious. Why did you feel the need to claim Mason right away?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting pressure on Viktor, I aim to shift suspicion towards him and away from Selene. This could make Viktor more defensive and potentially cause a slip-up, further adding to the confusion and protecting the true Werewolf, Selene.
> **Larisa:** Viktor, your reluctance to reveal your role is highly suspicious, especially since you've been casting doubt on others without providing any solid information. What is your role, and can you give us any information that might help clarify this situation?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Marius is strongly contesting Larisa's claim, pressing him for more details might reveal inconsistencies or provide further insight into who is lying. This helps narrow down the possibilities of who might be the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor:** Marius, you and Kraven both claim to be Masons and are contesting Larisa's claim. But what makes you so certain that Larisa is lying and not just mistaken? Could you provide any additional details that might clarify why you believe Larisa is not telling the truth?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been avoiding revealing his role while casting suspicion on others. We need his information to piece together the puzzle, especially since Larisa's claim contradicts what Kraven and I know.
> **Marius:** Viktor, Larisa has been under heavy suspicion, yet you haven't revealed your own role. If we are to believe Selene's claim as the Seer, then the Werewolf card she saw in the middle leaves us with only one Werewolf or potentially a Minion among us. Your reluctance to speak up makes me think you could be hiding something. So, Viktor, what role did you have and what information can you provide to us?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Marius is strongly contesting Larisa's claim, pressing him for more details might reveal inconsistencies or provide further insight into who is lying. This helps narrow down the possibilities of who might be the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor:** Marius, you and Kraven both claim to be Masons and are contesting Larisa's claim. But what makes you so certain that Larisa is lying and not just mistaken? Could you provide any additional details that might clarify why you believe Larisa is not telling the truth?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been deflecting and casting doubt without revealing his own role. Given that Kraven and I are confirmed Masons, and Selene claims to be the Seer with useful information, Viktor's hesitation strongly suggests he might be the Minion or the remaining Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Viktor, your reluctance to reveal your role is making you look very suspicious. Are you trying to hide something from us? We need to know your role to make sense of all these conflicting claims.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's early and confident claim of being a Mason is contested by both Marius and Kraven. This makes her role highly questionable. Additionally, Selene's Seer information suggests that one Werewolf is in the center, which means we need to focus on finding either the remaining Werewolf or the Minion. Larisa's behavior fits the pattern of a Minion trying to sow confusion and protect a Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** I believe Larisa might be the Minion trying to protect a hidden Werewolf. Her immediate claim as a Mason and defensive stance are highly suspicious to me.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been deflecting and casting doubt without revealing his own role. Given that Kraven and I are confirmed Masons, and Selene claims to be the Seer with useful information, Viktor's hesitation strongly suggests he might be the Minion or the remaining Werewolf. His role and information could be key in solving this mystery.
> **Marius:** Viktor, your reluctance to reveal your role while continuously casting doubt on others is highly suspicious. It's crucial for us to understand your role to make sense of these conflicting claims. What role did you have and can you provide any information to help us clarify this situation?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's immediate claim is highly suspicious, especially since it's being contested by both Marius and Kraven. Getting more details from her might reveal inconsistencies and help us determine if she's lying or not.
> **Viktor:** Marius and Kraven, you're both claiming to be Masons and accusing Larisa of lying. If you two really are the Masons, we should be able to trust you. But I want to hear more from Larisa about why she claimed to be a Mason so quickly. Larisa, can you provide any more details or reasons behind your claim?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** Viktor has consistently avoided revealing his role and has been casting doubt on others without providing any solid information. By accusing him, I aim to shift suspicion away from Selene and myself, protecting the true Werewolf and creating more confusion among the Villagers.
> **Larisa:** Alright, this is getting very heated and confusing. Viktor, the fact that you still haven't revealed your role is raising a lot of red flags for me. Marius and Kraven are both assertively claiming to be Masons, and Selene has claimed to be the Seer with some valuable insights into the center cards. If what Selene says is true, then we have only one Werewolf among us. Viktor, the way you've been dodging questions makes me highly suspicious. I urge everyone to consider that Viktor might be the actual Werewolf, and his hesitation is a sign of guilt.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's information could be crucial in verifying the claims of other players. By knowing which specific cards she looked at, we can better understand if there's a possibility of card swapping or if someone is lying about their role.
> **Viktor:** Selene, since you claim to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf card in the center, can you tell us which specific cards you looked at? This might help us narrow down the possibilities of who could be lying between Larisa, Marius, and Kraven.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By calling out Viktor directly for his suspicious behavior and lack of transparency, I aim to shift the focus and suspicion onto him, keeping the heat off myself. If Viktor ends up being voted out, it buys me more time and further cements mistrust among the remaining players.
> **Selene:** Alright, everyone, this has become quite a tangled web. I'm still inclined to trust my own knowledge as the Seer, and I genuinely believe the Werewolf is hiding among us. Viktor's reluctance to reveal his role and constant deflection raises too many red flags for me. Larisa, Marius, and Kraven, you all have your own stories and contestations, but we need to focus on the most suspicious behavior here. All signs point towards Viktor. Let's not lose sight of that.


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By continuously questioning Viktor and pointing out his suspicious behavior, I aim to shift the focus and suspicion away from Selene and myself, thereby protecting the true Werewolf. Viktor's reluctance to reveal his role makes him an easy target to frame as the actual Werewolf.
> **Larisa:** Viktor, your constant deflection and reluctance to reveal your role is extremely suspicious to me. If you have nothing to hide, then why haven't you been straightforward with us about your role and any information you might have? The fact that you're avoiding giving us clear answers makes me think you have something to hide. I believe you're trying to sow confusion to divert attention away from yourself. If you were truly on the village team, you would have already shared your role to help us make sense of this situation. I'm urging everyone to consider Viktor as the main suspect here.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I need to quickly identify who is lying. Larisa's confident claim of being a Mason is highly suspicious because it's being contested by two others. Pressing her for more details might reveal inconsistencies and clarify the situation.
> **Viktor:** Larisa, I find your immediate claim of being a Mason very suspicious, especially since it's contested by two others who also claim to be Masons. Can you provide more details or reasons behind your claim? Why did you feel the need to claim Mason right away?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By focusing the suspicion on Viktor and pointing out his suspicious behavior and reluctance to reveal his role, I aim to divert attention away from Selene and myself. This can help protect the true Werewolf and create enough confusion for us to survive the vote.
> **Larisa:** Marius, Kraven, and Viktor, this has been a wild ride of accusations and counterclaims. But let's take a step back and think logically. If Selene's claim as the Seer is true, and one Werewolf card is definitely in the center, that means we only have one Werewolf among us. The fact that Viktor has consistently avoided revealing his role and has been casting doubt without providing any clear information is a significant red flag. Viktor, your hesitation and deflection make me think you're trying to hide something. On the other hand, Marius and Kraven have been consistent in their Mason claims. To me, the most logical course of action is to focus on Viktor. His behavior fits that of someone trying to sow confusion. Let's vote for Viktor and see if we've found our Werewolf.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's behavior fits that of someone trying to hide something. His reluctance to share his role and continuous deflection of questions is highly suspicious. Since Marius and I are confirmed Masons, and Selene's Seer claim adds up, the most logical course of action is to focus on Viktor.
> **Kraven:** Viktor, your constant deflection and reluctance to reveal your role is extremely suspicious to me. If you have nothing to hide, then why haven't you been straightforward with us about your role and any information you might have? The fact that you're avoiding giving us clear answers makes me think you have something to hide. I believe you're trying to sow confusion to divert attention away from yourself. If you were truly on the village team, you would have already shared your role to help us make sense of this situation. I'm urging everyone to consider Viktor as the main suspect here.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius and Kraven's immediate and assertive contestation of Larisa's claim makes me think they might be trying to divert suspicion. Pressing Marius for more specific details could help clarify the situation and expose any inconsistencies in their story.
> **Viktor:** Marius, I find it very interesting that you and Kraven are both so quick to jump on Larisa's claim. If both of you are really the Masons, you should be able to provide more details about what you saw during the night or any other clues that might help us. Can you give us more specifics about your and Kraven's interactions or actions during the night?


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's behavior throughout this discussion has been highly suspicious. He has not provided any useful information about his role and has been deflecting questions. Given that Kraven and I are confirmed Masons, and Selene's claim as the Seer adds credibility to our information, Viktor stands out as the most likely suspect. It's crucial we focus our votes on him to increase our chances of finding the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Marius:** Viktor, your consistent avoidance of revealing your role, along with your attempts to deflect suspicion onto others, makes you look very guilty. You've been dancing around the issue and trying to sow confusion among us. If you were truly a Villager or any role on the village team, you would have been more forthcoming with information to help us. I believe you are the Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect someone. I'm urging everyone to vote for Viktor!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius and Kraven have been very assertive in their Mason claims, which makes me think they might be trying to divert suspicion away from themselves. Pressing Kraven for more details might reveal inconsistencies and help us determine if he's lying.
> **Viktor:** Kraven, you're claiming to be a Mason along with Marius, and you're both contesting Larisa's claim. I find it interesting that you're both so quick to jump on her. Can you tell us more about why you believe Larisa is lying and not just mistaken?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Marius and I are confirmed Masons, and Selene's Seer claim holds up. Larisa's claim of being a Mason is clearly false or misinformed. Given your evasive behavior, you stand out as the most suspicious. Let's not be misled by deflections and focus on Viktor.
> **Kraven:** Viktor, your behavior has been extremely evasive and suspicious. You've been dodging questions and deflecting blame without giving us any concrete information about your role. This makes me believe you are either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolf. We need to focus on you.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius and Kraven's immediate and assertive contestation of Larisa's claim makes me think they might be trying to divert suspicion. Pressing Marius for more specific details could help clarify the situation and expose any inconsistencies in their story.
> **Viktor:** Marius, you and Kraven have been very assertive in claiming to be Masons and accusing Larisa of lying. However, I find it suspicious that you both jumped on her so quickly. Can you provide any additional details or reasons why you believe Larisa is lying and not mistaken?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** Viktor has consistently avoided revealing his role and has been casting doubt on others without providing any solid information. This makes him the most suspicious player and the most likely target for the village's vote. By voting for Viktor, I aim to align with the village's suspicion and protect the true Werewolf, Selene.
> **Larisa [Minion]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Throughout the day phase, Viktor has been extremely evasive and reluctant to reveal his role, which is highly suspicious behavior. Given that Marius and I are confirmed Masons, and Selene's Seer claim checks out (one Werewolf card is in the center, and one Villager card is in the center), we can reasonably trust that there is only one Werewolf or a Minion among us. Larisa's early claim as a Mason is contradicted by the two actual Masons, making her suspicious as well, but Viktor's behavior is more indicative of someone hiding something. Therefore, I believe Viktor is the most likely candidate to be the Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Kraven [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Viktor's reluctance to reveal his role, combined with his constant deflection and suspicious behavior, makes him the easiest target for the majority. Voting for Viktor aligns with the general sentiment and increases the chances of someone other than myself being voted out.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's immediate and confident claim to be a Mason is highly suspicious, especially since it's contested by both Marius and Kraven. This suggests that she could be the Minion trying to protect a hidden Werewolf. Additionally, Selene's claim as the Seer indicates that one Werewolf card is in the center, which means we only have to find one Werewolf or Minion among us. Larisa's defensive and evasive behavior fits the pattern of someone trying to sow confusion. Therefore, I believe voting for Larisa is the best play to potentially eliminate a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Marius (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been consistently deflecting and avoiding revealing his role while casting doubt on others. Given that both Kraven and I are confirmed Masons, and Selene's claim as the Seer adds credibility to our information, Viktor's behavior suggests he is either the Werewolf or the Minion. By voting for Viktor, we have the highest chance of eliminating a threat to the village team.
> **Marius [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


The votes were:
* Larisa : Minion : 1
* Viktor : Villager : 4



>***GAME:*** Viktor was killed. The werewolves win.
