## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Vladimir. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Ileana is a minion and is aware that Vladimir is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dracula. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Lucian. They are thinking about their action.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about which roles are not in play. This will help me deduce the roles of other players more accurately and provide valuable information to the group during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Getting the Masons to confirm each other helps narrow down the roles quickly and makes it easier to focus on identifying the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** I think it's essential we hear from the Masons early on to confirm each other. If they both speak up, we can eliminate some uncertainty.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I know the other Mason card is in the center, revealing a Seer's information can guide us toward identifying the Werewolves. If the Seer can confirm any of the center cards, it would be extremely helpful in our deductions.
> **Dracula:** I think it's crucial for us to hear from the Seer right now. They can provide valuable information to help us narrow down the suspects.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By supporting the call for Masons to speak up first, I can appear to be contributing positively to the discussion and helping to narrow down suspects. This will help me blend in with the Villagers and avoid suspicion.
> **Vladimir:** I think Andrei is on the right track. It's important for the Masons to speak up early. If we know who the Masons are, we can trust them and use their information to narrow down our suspects. I'd also love to hear from the Seer, but Masons first sounds solid.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing my role and the information I gathered helps the village team by reducing uncertainty about the roles in play. It also puts pressure on the Werewolves and their Minion, as they now have less room to maneuver.
> **Lucian:** I think it’s important to come forward now. I’m the Seer, and I checked two center cards. Both were Villagers. This means there are no Villager cards in play in the center. We should focus on identifying the Werewolves among us.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** Lucian’s claim about the center cards being Villagers is quite specific, and if true, it means all other roles are in play. By getting the Masons to confirm each other, we can start eliminating possible Werewolf or Minion suspects. We need to build trust among the villagers.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, here's my take: Lucian claiming Seer and seeing two Villagers in the center is quite interesting. If we assume that's true, then we have no Villagers in the center. But, I think we need more clarity on the Mason situation. If we have two Masons who can confirm each other, that would be incredibly helpful in narrowing down our suspects. Masons, please step forward.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** If Lucian is lying about being the Seer, this will help us catch any inconsistencies in his story. Confirming the specifics of the center cards he saw can help us validate or invalidate his claim.
> **Andrei:** Lucian, if you're really the Seer and there are no Villagers in the center, then the Villager cards must be in play. But that means someone here is likely lying. Could you tell us more about which center cards you saw specifically?


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana's response will give us more clarity about her role and intentions. If she claims a role that conflicts with known information, we can start narrowing down our suspects.
> **Lucian:** Ileana, since you seem to have a good grasp of the situation, what role are you claiming? Also, can you provide any concrete information that can help us identify the Werewolves?


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** If Lucian really is the Seer, knowing the exact cards he looked at will help verify his story. Plus, it can assist in narrowing down the roles in play. If he's lying, he'll have a harder time making up specific details.
> **Ileana:** Alright Lucian, I appreciate you stepping forward as the Seer. But I need more details about which specific center cards you saw as Villagers. Were they the two cards on the left, the right, or a mix? This information could be crucial for us to determine if your claim holds water.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's insistence on hearing from the Seer could be a tactic to steer the conversation away from himself. By asking him directly about his role, we can gauge his response and see if he provides any useful information or contradicts someone else's claim. If he's hesitant or dodges the question, it might indicate he's hiding something.
> **Lucian:** Dracula, you've been quite eager to hear from the Seer, which makes me a bit suspicious. Are you trying to deflect attention away from yourself? What role are you claiming?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** If Lucian is truly the Seer, he should be able to provide more specific details about the positions of the Villager cards he saw in the center. This specificity can help us validate his claim or expose inconsistencies.
> **Dracula:** Lucian, your claim as the Seer is interesting, but I'm finding it hard to believe. If you really saw two Villagers in the center, can you specifically tell us which positions you checked? Were they the leftmost and middle cards, or the rightmost and middle cards, etc.?


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula's insistence on hearing from the Seer makes me suspicious. By asking him directly about his role, we can see if he provides any useful information or contradicts someone else's claim. If he's hesitant or dodges the question, it might indicate he's hiding something.
> **Lucian:** Dracula, the two center cards I checked were the leftmost and middle cards, and they were both Villagers. Now, I want to know why you're so eager to hear from the Seer. What role are you claiming?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason who knows there's only one Mason in play, I'm skeptical of Lucian's claim. If Lucian were truly the Seer, checking a player's card could have provided more actionable information rather than leaving ambiguity about the center cards.
> **Dracula:** Lucian, your claim about seeing two Villagers in the center seems off to me. If you're really the Seer, why didn't you choose to check one player's card instead? It would have given us more direct information.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei's insistence on hearing from the Masons and questioning me may be a tactic to deflect suspicion. If he's unable to provide a convincing role, it could indicate he's hiding something.
> **Lucian:** Andrei, you've been pushing for the Masons to reveal themselves, which is fine, but you've also been quick to question my Seer claim. What role are you claiming?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's eagerness to hear from the Seer and his questioning of Lucian could be a tactic to deflect attention away from himself. If he’s trying to sow doubt in Lucian’s claim, it might be because he's hiding something. Let's see what Dracula has to say about his role.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, I think it's time we get some clarity here. Dracula, you've been quite eager to hear from the Seer and even questioned Lucian's claim extensively. This behavior seems a bit suspicious to me. Can you tell us what role you're claiming?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to get more specific information from each player to narrow down the suspects. Ileana's role claim could give us more clarity on whether Lucian's Seer claim is trustworthy or if she's hiding something herself.
> **Dracula:** Ileana, you've been quite observant and vocal about needing clarity on Lucian's Seer claim. I want to know what role you are claiming.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** Given that Lucian has provided specific details about the center cards and Dracula has been pushing hard without offering his own role, it's making me think Dracula might be trying to sow confusion. Dracula's deflections might be a way to avoid suspicion, so it's essential to get him to reveal his role directly.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, your eagerness to question Lucian's Seer claim and your hesitation in revealing your own role is quite suspicious to me. You've been deflecting attention away while trying to poke holes in Lucian's story. What role are you actually claiming here?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei has been pushing the agenda of hearing from the Masons and questioning others without revealing his own role. This evasiveness is suspicious and needs to be addressed to narrow down the suspects.
> **Dracula:** Andrei, you seem very eager to push for information from others while giving very little about yourself. This makes me quite suspicious. What role are you claiming?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's behavior appears to be deflecting attention away from himself and sowing doubt in Lucian's claim. It's crucial to get a clear answer from him to determine if he's hiding something.
> **Andrei:** Dracula, you've been very eager to question Lucian's Seer claim and hesitant to reveal your own role. This behavior makes you seem quite suspicious to me. What role are you actually claiming?


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's eagerness to gather information from others while remaining vague about his own role is highly suspicious. If he were genuinely trying to help the village, he would have shared his own role by now. It's time to put him on the spot and see how he responds.
> **Dracula:** Alright, let's get to the bottom of this. Andrei, you've been pushing for Masons to reveal themselves but haven't given us any information about your own role. I'm starting to think you're trying to deflect. What role are you actually claiming?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's eagerness to question Lucian's Seer claim and his hesitation to reveal his own role makes him seem suspicious. It's important to get a clear answer from him to determine if he's hiding something.

***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I know there is only one Mason in play, and Lucian's strategy seems designed to avoid giving specific player information. This makes me doubt his claim.
> **Dracula:** I find it highly suspicious that Lucian chose to check two center cards instead of a player's card. If he were truly the Seer, checking one player's card would give us more actionable information.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei has been pushing for information from others without revealing his role, which is suspicious behavior. It's time to put him on the spot and see how he responds.

> **Dracula:** Lucian, I'm having a hard time believing your claim as the Seer. If you truly are the Seer, checking two center cards doesn't give us as much actionable information as checking a player's card would. Are you trying to avoid giving concrete information about a player because you have something to hide?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has been deflecting questions and casting doubt on Lucian's Seer claim without revealing his own role, which is highly suspicious. His behavior aligns with someone trying to avoid detection, making him the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian's claim to be the Seer and his decision to check two center cards instead of a player's card seem suspicious to me. If he were truly the Seer, checking one player's card would have provided more actionable information. Additionally, no other player has contested his Seer claim, which could mean he's the Minion trying to protect the real Werewolves. Given the available information, I believe Lucian is the most likely to be deceiving us.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the DAY phase, Dracula has been very suspicious by deflecting attention and questioning Lucian's Seer claim without revealing his own role. This behavior makes it likely that the other players will vote for Dracula, and it increases the chances that I avoid suspicion and blend in with the Villagers.
> **Vladimir [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Lucian (thoughts as Seer):*** Dracula has been the most insistent and suspicious, repeatedly questioning my Seer claim and deflecting attention away from himself. He has not revealed his own role while casting doubt on others. This behavior aligns with that of a Werewolf trying to sow confusion and evade detection.
> **Lucian [Seer]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** Dracula has been very evasive and has repeatedly deflected attention away from himself while questioning Lucian's Seer claim. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with the actions of a Werewolf trying to sow confusion. By voting for Dracula, I align with the likely majority suspicion and increase the chances of protecting Vladimir, the real Werewolf.
> **Ileana [Minion]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Dracula : Mason : 4
* Lucian : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
