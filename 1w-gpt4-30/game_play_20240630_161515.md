## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Dracula. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Andrei. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Ileana. They are thinking about their action.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to reveal Andrei's card because it will help me gather information about at least one player's role. If he turns out to be a Werewolf, I can steer the conversation towards him during the day phase. If he's a Villager or a special role, I can either confirm his innocence or gather more clues based on his claims and actions.


The seer looked at a card from Andrei and saw the card Mason

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** I'm looking for the Seer to reveal themselves and share any information they gathered about the center cards. This will help us identify potential Werewolves and avoid mislynching a Villager or an ally.
> **Andrei:** Alright, let's get things moving! Who here has information about the center cards? Did anyone get a chance to peek?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Asking a general question might prompt someone to reveal useful information that can help us identify Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** I'm curious if anyone here is willing to admit to seeing something suspicious during their night phase.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Seer and providing information about the center cards, I can steer the discussion away from myself and towards other roles that might be more likely to draw suspicion. With the Drunk and one Villager potentially out of play, it narrows down the roles we need to consider, making it easier to cast doubt on others.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, let's keep things clear. I had the role of the Seer and decided to take a look at two of the center cards. I saw the Drunk and one Villager card in the center, which means they are not in play. This leaves us with less suspicion on those claiming to be Drunk or Villager. We need to focus on the more suspicious roles now.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim as the Seer and the information he provided could be a key factor in determining the actual roles in play. By questioning his choice, we might uncover inconsistencies or validate his claim. This could help us identify if he is truly on the village team or not.
> **Marius:** Dracula, you claimed to be the Seer and mentioned seeing the Drunk and a Villager in the center. Can you explain why you chose to look at the center cards rather than another player's card?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Marius directly and justifying my choice as the 'Seer,' I can appear more trustworthy and strategic. This also diverts suspicion away from me by making it seem like my actions were for the benefit of the group. Additionally, it helps to frame the discussion around the center cards, which I know are not Werewolves, reducing the risk of accidental elimination.
> **Dracula:** Marius, strategically, I chose to look at the center cards to ensure we have a clearer understanding of the roles that are not in play. Knowing that the Drunk and a Villager are in the center helps us narrow down the possibilities and focus on finding the Werewolves among us.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's question about suspicious activity could indicate that he knows more than he's letting on. Pressing him for details might reveal inconsistencies or useful information that can help identify the Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Viktor, you asked if anyone saw something suspicious during the night phase. Did you see anything or are you just trying to gather information from others?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** If Dracula is truly the Seer and peeked at the center cards, confirming the absence of a Werewolf card in the center would help narrow down our suspicions by eliminating any possibility of a Werewolf being in the center. This would also validate Dracula's claim as the Seer.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, you claimed to be the Seer and mentioned seeing the Drunk and a Villager in the center. Can you confirm if you saw any evidence of a Werewolf card in the center?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing a question back at Viktor, I can shift the focus onto him and potentially create doubt about his intentions. This helps to divert suspicion away from me and keeps the other players' attention occupied.
> **Dracula:** Viktor, I didn't see a Werewolf card in the center. But your question makes me curious about your role. Are you trying to gather information to help the village, or are you strategically positioning yourself? I'd like to know what role you have.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's delayed claim about seeing the Drunk and Villager in the center feels suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, he would have stated this information immediately to help the village. This inconsistency makes me question his role and motivations.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, I think you're being strategic here. You claimed to be the Seer and said you saw the Drunk and a Villager in the center. But why didn't you mention this earlier? It seems odd that you'd withhold such important information.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Viktor and asking him directly about his role, I can shift the attention away from myself and create pressure on him to reveal his role. This might make it harder for him to accuse me further and cast doubt on his intentions.
> **Dracula:** Viktor, I'm genuinely curious about your role here. You're questioning my actions as the Seer, but you haven't given us any information about your own role or actions during the night. What were you up to?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's delayed reveal of the Seer's information about the Drunk and Villager in the center seems suspicious, making me question whether he is actually the Seer or trying to mislead us.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, your claim of being the Seer seems a bit too strategic. If you really were the Seer, you would have immediately shared that the Drunk and Villager were in the center to help the village. I suspect you might be hiding something.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By calling for more information and focusing on the center cards, I can redirect attention away from my own claims and encourage others to reveal their roles or actions. This helps to gather more information while keeping myself under the radar. Additionally, it keeps the discussion broad and less focused on me specifically.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, I think it's time we get more clarity here. We've had a lot of accusations flying around, and it’s important we focus on the facts. Who else here has concrete information about the center cards or their roles? We need to piece things together if we want to make the right choice.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** As a Seer, I know Dracula's claim is false because I'm the true Seer. By challenging his claim, I can start to unravel potential lies and guide the village towards the true Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, your claim of being the Seer doesn't sit right with me. You mentioned seeing the Drunk and a Villager in the center, yet you waited until now to share that information. It's crucial for the village to know such details as early as possible. Why didn't you speak up immediately?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Ileana's concern and providing a plausible reason for my delay, I can appear more strategic and calculated. Shifting the focus to Andrei, who has been quiet, can help divert suspicion away from me and place it onto someone else, making it harder for them to accuse me further.
> **Dracula:** Ileana, I understand your concern. The reason I didn't speak up immediately about seeing the Drunk and Villager cards in the center is because I wanted to see if anyone else would make suspicious claims first. By holding back a bit, I could better gauge everyone's reactions and see if anyone would contradict my information. Now that we have more accusations flying around, it's clear we need to focus on those who are acting the most suspicious. Andrei, you've been relatively quiet. What's your role in all of this?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been deflecting and questioning Dracula without providing any solid information about his own role. This behavior seems like he's trying to sow confusion and suspicion, which makes me think he could be a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Andrei:** Alright, everyone, listen up! Based on everything we've heard so far, I'm getting a really suspicious vibe from Viktor. He's been questioning Dracula a lot but hasn't given us any information about his own role. It's time to be upfront, Viktor. What's your role?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, my goal is to identify the Werewolves. Dracula's delayed revelation about the Drunk and Villager cards in the center seems suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, he should have shared this information immediately to help the village. By questioning him, I aim to uncover inconsistencies in his story and determine if he is hiding something.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, your claim of being the Seer and revealing the Drunk and Villager cards in the center doesn't sit right with me. Why did you wait so long to share this crucial information?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the focus onto Andrei, who has been relatively quiet, I can shift suspicion away from myself. This also puts pressure on him to reveal his role, which might help the village team narrow down the potential Werewolves while diverting attention from my own suspicious behavior.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, I think it's time we focus on something crucial. We've had a lot of back-and-forth about my claim as the Seer, but let's not forget the bigger picture. If I were really trying to deceive you, why would I provide concrete information about the center cards? Let's consider who has been deflecting and avoiding giving concrete information about their own roles. Andrei, you've been quiet and haven't shared much. What's your role in all of this?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's behavior is highly suspicious as he keeps questioning Dracula's claims without giving any concrete information about his own role. This makes me think he could be trying to sow confusion and potentially hiding the fact that he's a Werewolf or the Minion. It's crucial to press him for his role to clarify the situation and prevent the village from making a wrong move.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, your constant deflection and questioning without providing any solid information about your own role is very suspicious. What are you hiding? It's time to come clean and tell us your role.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, my goal is to identify the Werewolves. Dracula's delayed revelation about the center cards and his deflective behavior make me suspicious that he might be hiding something. By questioning him directly, I hope to reveal inconsistencies in his story.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, your explanation for delaying the information about the center cards doesn't add up. If you were really the Seer, you would have immediately shared that information to help the village. You've been deflecting suspicion back onto others, which seems like a tactic to mislead us.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Ileana's concern and redirecting the focus back to Viktor, I can maintain my claim as the Seer and cast suspicion on Viktor for his lack of transparency. This helps to shift the attention away from me and keep the discussion broad, making it harder for others to zero in on me as a Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Alright, folks, it's getting pretty tense here, but I want to circle back to some key points. Ileana, you've raised some valid concerns about why I delayed sharing the information about the Drunk and the Villager in the center. But let's not lose sight of the fact that Viktor has been deflecting a lot of questions and hasn't given us any solid information about his role. Viktor, if you're really trying to help the village, why haven't you been more transparent about your own actions during the night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's behavior seems strategically manipulative, and his delayed reveal of crucial information makes me question his claim of being the Seer. By directly questioning Dracula, I aim to uncover any inconsistencies in his story and determine if he is misleading us.
> **Viktor:** Ileana, you've been raising concerns about Dracula, and I agree with your suspicions. Dracula, you've been deflecting a lot and your delayed reveal about the center cards doesn't add up. Why didn't you share that information immediately if you were truly the Seer?


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By focusing on Andrei, who has been quiet, I can shift suspicion away from myself and place it onto someone else. This also puts pressure on him to reveal his role, which might help the village team narrow down the potential Werewolves while diverting attention from my own suspicious behavior.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, let's focus for a moment. We've been going in circles with a lot of accusations and defenses, but we need to piece together the information we have. I claimed to be the Seer and saw the Drunk and a Villager in the center. Viktor has been deflecting and questioning me without providing any concrete information about his own role. Andrei has been relatively quiet and hasn't given us much detail either. It's crucial that we hear from everyone. Andrei, it's time for you to reveal your role or any information you have. What did you see or do during the night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's constant deflection and questioning without providing any information about his role is very suspicious. This kind of behavior aligns with someone trying to sow confusion, which is a tactic used by Werewolves or the Minion. We need to target him.
> **Andrei:** Alright, listen up everyone! Viktor has been dodging questions and deflecting attention since the beginning. This is classic Werewolf or Minion behavior! I'm accusing Viktor of being on the Werewolf team. We need to focus our votes on him to win this.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's constant deflection and questioning without providing any information about his role is very suspicious. This kind of behavior aligns with someone trying to sow confusion, which is a tactic used by Werewolves or the Minion. We need to target him.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, let's cut to the chase. I'm getting a really suspicious vibe from Viktor here. He's been dodging questions, deflecting attention, and not providing any solid information about his own role. This is classic Werewolf or Minion behavior! I'm accusing Viktor of being on the Werewolf team. We need to focus our votes on him to win this.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's sudden and strong accusation against me seems like a deflection. He has not provided any useful information about his own role or actions during the night phase. By questioning him, I aim to uncover any potential inconsistencies or reveal his hidden agenda.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, you have been very quiet and only now are you making a strong accusation against me. Why have you waited until now to speak up? What information do you have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's constant deflection and questioning without providing any information about his role is very suspicious. This kind of behavior aligns with someone trying to sow confusion, which is a tactic used by Werewolves or the Minion. We need to target him.
> **Andrei:** Alright, everyone, let's cut to the chase. I'm getting a really suspicious vibe from Viktor here. He's been dodging questions, deflecting attention, and not providing any solid information about his own role. This is classic Werewolf or Minion behavior! I'm accusing Viktor of being on the Werewolf team. We need to focus our votes on him to win this.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By keeping the focus on Viktor and urging the group to come to a consensus, I can maintain the suspicion on him and solidify the group's decision to vote for him. This helps to divert attention away from myself and align the group's efforts towards voting for someone else, increasing my chances of survival.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, it's time to focus on the facts and narrow down our suspicions. We've heard a lot of accusations flying around, but we need to make a decision based on the information we have. I still believe that Viktor's constant deflection and questioning without providing solid information about his own role is very suspicious. Are we all in agreement to vote for Viktor, or does anyone have new information that might change our course of action?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's delayed reveal of crucial information about the center cards is suspicious. If he truly were the Seer, he would've shared that info right away to help clear up potential confusion and guide the village towards identifying the Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Dracula, you've made a strong claim of being the Seer and seeing the Drunk and Villager in the center. But why didn't you share this information right away? It seems like a vital piece of information that would help the village immediately.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the focus onto Andrei, who has been quiet and is now making strong accusations, I can divert suspicion away from myself. This also puts pressure on him to reveal his role, and any inconsistencies in his story can help to shift the group's attention and suspicion away from me as the Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Andrei, you've been relatively quiet throughout this discussion and only now coming forward with strong accusations against Viktor. This seems very convenient timing. Can you provide us with any concrete information about your role or what you saw during the night?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's behavior has been consistently suspicious. He's been deflecting attention and questioning others without revealing his own role. We need to press him for information to determine if he's a Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, you've been dodging questions and not giving us any solid info about your role. What's going on? Time to come clean. What did you see or do during the night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Throughout the discussion, Viktor has consistently deflected questions and cast doubt on others without providing any concrete information about his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with tactics used by Werewolves or the Minion to sow confusion among the villagers. Given that Dracula's claim as the Seer has not been directly countered and the information about the Drunk and Villager in the center helps narrow down the roles, targeting Viktor seems the best course to identify a potential threat to the village.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's delayed reveal about the center cards and the claim of being the Seer feels suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, he would have shared the information immediately to help the village. His deflective behavior and the inconsistencies in his story make me believe he might be a Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Viktor has been deflecting questions and hasn't provided any concrete information about his own role. This behavior has made him the most suspicious player. Additionally, both Andrei and Ileana have expressed doubts about Viktor, making him the most likely target for the village's vote. By voting for Viktor, I align myself with the majority and increase the chances of someone other than me getting voted out.
> **Dracula [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's delayed reveal of the Seer information about the Drunk and Villager cards in the center is highly suspicious. If Dracula were truly the Seer, revealing this information immediately would have been crucial to help the village narrow down potential Werewolves. Additionally, Dracula has been deflecting suspicion onto others without providing solid reasoning. This behavior aligns more closely with that of a Werewolf trying to mislead the village.
> **Marius [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** I am the real Seer, and Dracula falsely claimed to be the Seer. This strongly indicates that Dracula is either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves. By voting for Dracula, we have a better chance of eliminating a member of the Werewolf team.
> **Ileana [Seer]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Viktor : Villager : 2
* Dracula : Werewolf : 3



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The villagers win.
