## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather information from other players to understand their roles. Radu might have some vital information about the roles or cards in the center.
> **Emil:** Radu, what did you see during the night?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing this information, it helps establish trust between Alexia and me, and confirms to the group that we're both Masons. This can help us identify the real Werewolves faster.
> **Radu:** I saw Alexia as the other Mason last night.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** By stating this, it helps establish trust between Alexia and me, and confirms to the group that we're both Masons. This can help us identify the real Werewolves faster.
> **Radu:** Alexia and I are Masons. We can confirm each other's roles. So, we're definitely not the Werewolves. Let's focus on finding the real Werewolves.


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Emil started by questioning Radu, it seems he might have some information or is fishing for information. It's worth seeing if he has more to share or if he's trying to divert attention.
> **Alexia:** Emil, do you have any insight about the roles of other players? Have you seen anything or heard any clues that might help us identify the Werewolves?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather more information from players who haven't spoken yet, which might help identify inconsistencies or reveal vital clues about the Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Lucian, you haven't said anything yet. Do you have any information to share?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming the Seer role and providing information about the center cards, I can build credibility and steer suspicion away from myself as the Werewolf. Additionally, revealing that the Minion is in the center removes a potential threat, making it easier for the village team to focus on finding the remaining Werewolf. This will hopefully direct the attention away from me and reduce the chances of being accused.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone seems to be sharing a lot of information. I have some interesting insights as well. During the night, I used my Seer ability to look at two of the center cards. One of them was a Villager, and the other was the Minion. This means that the Minion is definitely not among us, and we have one less suspicious role to worry about.


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** Lucian's claim of seeing a Villager and a Minion in the center is an attempt to discredit any Minion claims, which could make him seem more trustworthy. By questioning his omission of the third card, I can sow doubt about his true role and protect Lucian indirectly by shifting suspicion away from him.
> **Larisa:** I'm a bit puzzled here. Lucian, your claim of seeing the Minion in the center is quite convenient. If there's no Minion among us, it makes it easier to target someone else as a Werewolf. However, doesn't it seem odd that you didn't mention the third center card? Maybe you’re trying to divert attention from yourself.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Radu, I aim to create some doubt around the Mason claims and divert attention away from me. This can help me gather more information and potentially find inconsistencies in their stories, while also appearing engaged and helpful to the group.
> **Lucian:** Radu, you mentioned that you saw Alexia as the other Mason. Can you give us more details about how confident you are in this? Did you see anything else that might help us determine who the Werewolf could be?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** By questioning Lucian's omission of the third center card, I'm trying to determine if he's bluffing or telling the truth. If he's lying, he's likely trying to deflect suspicion from himself and might be a Werewolf. If he's truthful, it narrows down the possible roles of other players.
> **Radu:** Lucian, I'm finding your claim about seeing the Minion in the center a bit suspicious. The Seer can look at either one player's card or two center cards, but you haven't mentioned the third center card at all. Can you clarify why that is?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Radu's question directly, I can provide a more detailed explanation of my Seer claim, aiming to reduce suspicion on myself. Additionally, encouraging others to share information about the third center card can help in deflecting attention and potentially causing confusion among the players.
> **Lucian:** Radu, I understand your concern, but let me clarify again. I only had a chance to look at two center cards as the Seer, and those were the Villager and the Minion. I didn't see the third card. If someone else has any information about the third center card, please share it. We need to consider all possibilities to find the Werewolf.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** By asking Larisa to reveal her role and what she experienced during the night, we can gather more information to determine if anyone is lying or withholding important details. It's crucial to get everyone to talk and share their roles to identify inconsistencies.
> **Radu:** Larisa, you pointed out that Lucian didn't mention the third center card, which is a good observation. But you haven't told us anything about what you did during the night. Can you share your role and what you experienced?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** Emil hasn't provided much information about his role yet, and putting him on the spot might deflect attention away from Lucian while also potentially revealing more roles, which can help us fabricate a more convincing narrative.
> **Larisa:** Emil, I noticed you've been pretty quiet and only asked Radu a question. Can you tell us more about your role and what you did during the night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa deflected attention to me without providing any information about her own role. This makes her behavior suspicious, and we need to hear more from her to make an informed decision.
> **Emil:** Larisa, you've been pretty quiet and haven't shared much information about your role yet. Can you tell us what you did during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I minimize the risk of contradicting anyone else's claims about special roles. Pressuring Emil to reveal more information might help shift focus away from Lucian and provide more details to weave a convincing narrative later.
> **Larisa:** Emil, I understand that you're curious about my role. During the night, I didn't have any special actions to perform because I'm just a Villager. But I find it interesting that you haven't shared any useful information yet. We need to work together effectively, and it's important for everyone to be transparent. So, Emil, what exactly did you do during the night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's behavior of deflecting attention and late claim of being a Villager raises suspicion. It's important to press her for more information to determine if she's hiding something.
> **Emil:** Larisa, your actions seem suspicious to me because you've deflected attention towards me without providing concrete information about your role. Why did you wait so long to claim to be just a Villager? If you had nothing to hide, you could have shared this earlier to help our investigation.


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Emil further, I aim to shift suspicion away from Lucian and create a narrative that paints Emil as the suspicious player. This not only helps protect Lucian but also keeps the focus on someone else, allowing me to frame the discussion in a way that benefits the Werewolf team.
> **Larisa:** Emil, you've been trying to deflect attention back onto me after I questioned you. It's interesting that you've been so quiet and only started talking when I asked you about your role. I'm still just a Villager, but your reluctance to share more details is quite suspicious. If we're going to find the real Werewolf, we need everyone to be open. Please, tell us what you did during the night and why you've been so evasive.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's behavior has been suspicious because she deflected attention towards me without providing concrete information about her role. It's crucial to press her for more information to determine if she's hiding something and potentially a Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Larisa, the more I hear from you, the more suspicious I get. You've been deflecting attention and your late claim of being a Villager doesn't sit right with me. Why didn't you simply say you were a Villager earlier to help the investigation?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Emil's reluctance, I aim to shift suspicion away from Lucian and make it seem like Emil is hiding something. This creates doubt among the players and helps protect Lucian, the Werewolf.
> **Larisa:** Everyone, let's take a step back and think about this. We have Radu and Alexia claiming to be Masons and confirming each other. Lucian claims to have seen a Villager and a Minion in the center. If we're to believe these claims, the roles left are two Villagers and the Seer. Considering my role as a Villager, I'm inclined to believe that we're missing a piece of the puzzle. Emil, you've been avoiding answering questions directly, which is suspicious. We need to ensure transparency. Why are you so hesitant to share your role?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly accusing Emil and pointing out his evasive behavior, I aim to cast suspicion on him and divert attention away from myself. This can help shift the focus of the group and create doubt about Emil's intentions, potentially causing the group to rally against him instead of me.
> **Lucian:** Emil, you've been incredibly evasive and deflective throughout this whole discussion. You haven't given us any clarity about your role or what you did during the night. This kind of behavior is highly suspicious, and I think you're trying to hide something. Are you the Werewolf, Emil?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's behavior of deflecting attention and her delayed claim of just being a Villager raise red flags. She didn't contribute to the discussion until I questioned her, which seems like she's trying to hide something. We need to gather our votes and target someone who seems suspicious, and right now, that's Larisa.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, I think it's about time we started making some decisions. Larisa's deflections and late claim of being a Villager are really suspicious to me. Plus, she didn't provide any useful information until I pressed her. I'm accusing Larisa of being the Werewolf.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's behavior of deflecting attention and her delayed claim of just being a Villager raise red flags. She didn't provide any useful information until questioned, which seems like she's trying to hide something.
> **Emil:** Larisa, I still find your actions quite suspicious. You didn't contribute any information until you were directly questioned, and your late claim of being a Villager doesn't add up. Why did you wait so long to tell us your role?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning the validity of Alexia and Radu's claims, I aim to create doubt and shift the focus away from Lucian. If their mutual confirmation is weakened, it opens up more room for suspicion and confusion, protecting Lucian and keeping the heat off the Werewolf team.
> **Larisa:** Alexia, Radu, you both claim to be Masons and confirm each other. But let's consider this: what if one of you isn't telling the truth? How can we be certain you're both Masons when we only have your words to rely on?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil has been deflecting questions and avoiding direct answers. This kind of behavior is often indicative of someone trying to hide their true role. As a Mason, it's my job to help the villagers find the Werewolves, and Emil's actions are raising a lot of red flags.
> **Alexia:** Emil, you've been very evasive throughout this discussion. You're deflecting questions and not providing any solid information. This behavior is highly suspicious to me. Why have you been so secretive?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's claim could easily be fabricated, and his explanation for not knowing the third center card is suspicious. Larisa's behavior is suspicious too, but we need to scrutinize Lucian's claim more closely to see if it holds up.
> **Emil:** Lucian, your claim as the Seer is very convenient and it's easy to make up seeing cards in the center. Why should we believe you over Larisa being a Villager?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning the reliability of Alexia and Radu's claims of being Masons, I aim to create doubt about their trustworthiness. This can shift the focus away from me and make other players reconsider their assumptions, potentially causing confusion and misdirection among the group.
> **Lucian:** Alexia, Radu, you both have confirmed each other as Masons, but I find it odd that no one has questioned the possibility of one of you lying. Let's consider all possibilities: what if one of you is not actually a Mason? It's convenient to back each other up, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's true. Can you provide more details on your actions and observations during the night to assure us of your roles?


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's actions and deflections are raising a lot of red flags. As a Mason, my goal is to help the villagers find the Werewolves, and Emil's behavior is not aligning with that of a villager or an ally. Pressuring him might reveal more about his true role and intentions.
> **Alexia:** Emil, your behavior has been extremely evasive and deflective throughout this entire discussion. You've avoided giving us any concrete information about your role and only started talking when pressured. This kind of behavior is highly suspicious and usually indicative of someone trying to hide their true intentions. Emil, why have you been so secretive?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's behavior has been suspicious because she deflected attention towards me without providing concrete information about her role. It's crucial to press her for more information to determine if she's hiding something.
> **Emil:** Larisa, I still find your actions quite suspicious. You didn't contribute any information until you were directly questioned, and your late claim of being a Villager doesn't add up. Why did you wait so long to tell us your role?


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Emil on the spot and questioning his lack of transparency, I aim to shift the focus and suspicion away from Lucian. Emil’s evasiveness can be painted as a sign of guilt, making him a more likely target for the group's suspicion. This helps to protect Lucian and increases the chances of the Werewolf team's victory.
> **Larisa:** Emil, your reluctance to share your role and your constant deflection are deeply concerning to me. You're accusing me without providing any solid evidence, and your actions seem like those of someone trying to hide something. If you were truly innocent, you would have nothing to fear from transparency. So, Emil, once again, what did you do during the night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's confidence in his claim as a Mason and his confirmation of Alexia needs to be scrutinized a bit more. By asking for more details, we can verify the credibility of his claim and ensure we're not being misled.
> **Emil:** Radu, you've been pretty confident about your Mason claim. Can you provide more specific details about your actions and any observations you made during the night?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's behavior has been consistently evasive and deflective. He hasn't provided any useful information about his role and only started accusing others when pressured. This kind of behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of someone trying to hide their true intentions.
> **Radu:** Emil, your evasiveness and constant deflection make me highly suspicious of you. You've avoided answering directly and haven't provided us with any solid information about your role. I think you're trying to hide something. Are you the Werewolf?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's behavior throughout the discussion has been suspicious. She deflected attention towards me without providing concrete information about her role and only claimed to be a Villager when directly questioned. Additionally, her reluctance to provide any useful information until pressed makes it seem like she's hiding something. Other players like Radu and Alexia have confirmed each other as Masons, and Lucian provided some insight as the Seer, albeit somewhat suspiciously. However, Larisa's actions and delayed claims raise more red flags, leading me to believe she could be the Werewolf.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's behavior has been consistently evasive and deflective throughout the entire discussion. He hasn't provided any useful information about his role, only accusing others when pressured. This behavior is highly indicative of someone trying to hide their true intentions. Given that Alexia and I have confirmed each other as Masons, and Lucian's claim as Seer seems credible, Emil is the most suspicious and likely to be the Werewolf.
> **Radu [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Throughout the discussion, Emil has been evasive and deflective, avoiding giving any concrete information about his role. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of someone trying to hide their true intentions. Additionally, Emil's accusations against Larisa seem to be an attempt to shift attention away from himself. As both Radu and I have confirmed each other as Masons, it suggests that we are not the Werewolves. Lucian's claim to have seen the Minion and a Villager in the center aligns with the roles left, making Emil the most likely candidate for a Werewolf.
> **Alexia [Mason]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Larisa (thoughts as Minion):*** Throughout the discussion, Emil has been evasive and deflective, which has made him a primary target of suspicion among the players. By voting for Emil, I align myself with the group's suspicion, increasing the chances that Emil will be chosen as the one to be voted out. This strategy helps protect Lucian, the Werewolf, and increases the chances of victory for the Werewolf team.
> **Larisa [Minion]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Emil has been evasive and deflective, avoiding giving concrete information about his role. This behavior has made him the most suspicious player in the eyes of others. Voting for Emil aligns with the village's suspicions and increases the likelihood of someone other than me being voted out.
> **Lucian [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Emil : Villager : 4
* Larisa : Minion : 1



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The werewolves win.
