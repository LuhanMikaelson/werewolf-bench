## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Semira. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Alexia is a minion and is aware that Semira is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Kraven and Alexandra. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Mircea. They are thinking about their action.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me more information about the roles that are not in play, which can help narrow down the possibilities for the other players' roles. This will also help identify if any potentially dangerous roles (such as the Werewolf or Minion) are not in play.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.


---

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** Initiating the conversation with a role that doesn't wake up at night is a safe way to blend in. By urging everyone to share their roles, I can identify potential threats to Semira and steer the discussion accordingly.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, let's start sharing what roles we had last night. I think it will help us piece together the events and figure out who the werewolf might be. I'll start: I was a Villager, and I didn't wake up at night. What about the rest of you?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing that Alexandra is a Mason, I can build trust with her and hopefully with the rest of the group. This also helps narrow down the possible roles for the others, making it easier to identify any potential Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Alright, I'll go next. I know for a fact that Alexandra is a Mason because I saw her during the night.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Knowing that two Villager cards are in the center helps us narrow down the possible roles in play. This means there are fewer Villager cards among us players, and it increases the likelihood that someone here is lying about their role. We should pay close attention to the claims being made.
> **Mircea:** Hold on, everyone. I need to make a critical point here. Last night, I used my ability as a Seer and looked at two of the center cards. They were both Villager cards.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Seer and providing a plausible center card that is not yet mentioned, I can create doubt about Mircea's claim and redirect suspicion away from myself. This also helps sow confusion among the others as they try to reconcile conflicting information.
> **Semira:** Okay, everyone, let's piece this all together. Mircea, you claim to have seen two Villagers in the center. That's interesting because it means two of the Villager roles are not in play. Kraven, you said Alexandra is a Mason. Alexandra, can you confirm this? That leaves three Villager roles in play among us. If Alexia is correct about being a Villager, then we need to figure out these other roles. For transparency, I will claim to have been the Seer and I looked at one center card. It was the Drunk card, which means the Drunk card is not in play.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** If there are two Villagers and a Drunk in the center as claimed, then all other roles must be in play among us. Since Alexia claims to be a Villager, but that role is supposed to be in the center according to Mircea and Semira, she could be lying and might be the Werewolf trying to blend in.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, Kraven and I can confirm each other as Masons, which means we're definitely on the village team. Since Mircea claimed to see two Villagers in the center and Semira claimed to see the Drunk in the center, it means we have confirmed three center cards: two Villagers and the Drunk. This contradicts Alexia's claim of being a Villager, making her seem quite suspicious to me.


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Mircea's claim and suggesting he might be lying, I aim to shift suspicion away from Semira and create confusion among the other players. This helps in protecting the identity of the Werewolf and aligns with my goal as a Minion.
> **Alexia:** Wait a minute, everyone. Let's think this through carefully. If Mircea claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, and Semira claims to have seen the Drunk card, that indeed accounts for three center cards. However, we also need to consider that it's possible someone might be lying to confuse us. Semira's claim directly contradicts Mircea's because if the Drunk is in the center, then there can't be two Villagers as Mircea claimed. Maybe Mircea is trying to throw us off, and we should be cautious about taking his words at face value.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** By pressing Mircea for more details, we can potentially identify inconsistencies in their story. This will help us determine if Mircea is lying or if Alexia's claim is false. Since we know Alexandra and I are Masons, we need to focus on uncovering the truth behind the conflicting statements from Mircea, Semira, and Alexia.
> **Kraven:** Mircea, your statement is quite interesting, but there's a potential contradiction here. If you saw two Villagers in the center and Semira saw the Drunk card in the center, that's three cards, which matches the number of center cards. However, this directly conflicts with Alexia's claim of being a Villager. One of these claims must be false. Mircea, can you explain more about why you chose to look at two center cards instead of one player's card?


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly questioning Semira about her conflicting claim, I can put pressure on her to justify her role. If she struggles to explain or provide evidence, it may reveal her as a liar, which helps the village team narrow down potential werewolves or minions.
> **Mircea:** Semira, your claim to be the Seer and to have seen the Drunk card in the center seems suspicious to me. I am the Seer, and I saw two Villager cards in the center. We can't both be the Seer, so one of us is lying. Why should we believe your claim over mine?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Mircea's decision-making process, I can cast doubt on his claim of being the Seer. This helps divert attention away from myself, especially since I'm trying to maintain my fabricated Seer identity. It also aligns with the fact that I saw the Drunk card in the center, which I can use to build a case against Mircea.
> **Semira:** Mircea, I think you're being a bit too defensive here. If you truly are the Seer, why didn't you choose to look at one player's card instead of two center cards? That would have given us more concrete information about someone at the table. Moreover, if you really saw two Villager cards in the center, it seems very convenient that you're trying to discredit my claim of seeing the Drunk card. I'm not saying you're definitely the Werewolf, but your actions and claims so far make me suspicious. Can you explain why you chose to look at two center cards instead of one player's card?


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** By questioning Semira's conflicting claim directly, I can put pressure on her to clarify or justify her statement. This helps the village team narrow down potential liars, which aids in identifying the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Mircea:** Semira, your claim to be the Seer worries me. I looked at two center cards because it gives us a broader understanding of what's not in play, which is valuable information for the village. Your insistence on being the Seer and seeing the Drunk card is very suspicious, especially since it conflicts with my verified information. Could you explain why you think your information is more reliable than mine?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By involving Alexandra in the discussion, I aim to leverage the Mason confirmation between her and Kraven to add legitimacy to my fabricated Seer claim. This also keeps the conversation dynamic and focused on discrediting Mircea's statement, which is crucial for my survival as the Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Alexandra, since you and Kraven are confirming each other as Masons, which is very helpful for the village, I'd like to get your take on the current situation. Given the conflicting Seer claims between Mircea and myself, who do you think is more likely telling the truth, and why?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** It's crucial to figure out which Seer claim is true to identify any inconsistencies. Given that I am a Mason and trust Kraven, I am more inclined to believe Mircea's version of events. Semira's claim conflicts directly with Mircea's and thus appears more suspicious to me.
> **Alexandra:** Semira, your claim to be the Seer doesn't make sense because Mircea already claimed to be the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center. This means one of you is definitely lying. Since Kraven and I are Masons, we know we're on the village team. Mircea's explanation seems more plausible to me because viewing two center cards gives us a broader understanding of what's not in play. So, Semira, explain why we should believe your claim over Mircea's.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Alexia's view on the matter could sway opinions, especially since she is under suspicion. By directing a question towards her, I can challenge her to justify her position, potentially creating further confusion or doubt about Mircea's claim. This also deflects some attention away from myself, as it involves another player in the direct questioning.
> **Semira:** Alexia, given the current conflicting claims about the Seer role and the center cards, can you explain why you think Mircea's claim is more credible than mine? What specific points make you lean towards his side?


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Mircea's decision-making as the Seer, I aim to cast further doubt on his claim and shift suspicion towards him. This helps protect Semira, who I know is the Werewolf, and aligns with my goal as the Minion to create confusion and divert attention away from her.
> **Alexia:** Mircea, I need to address this directly to you. Your explanation for looking at two center cards seems plausible, but there's a detail that bothers me. If you truly are the Seer, why would you choose to look at two center cards instead of one player's card when that could give us more definitive information about someone at the table? Especially when you know that revealing a player's role can help us identify Werewolves more effectively. This makes your claim less credible to me. Can you justify your decision further?


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** By questioning Alexia directly, I can put pressure on her to justify her role. This will help us determine if she is lying, which is crucial for identifying potential Werewolves or Minions. Her response will also provide more information for the village team to consider.
> **Mircea:** Alexia, your claim of being a Villager doesn't add up given that I saw two Villager cards in the center. Semira's claim of being the Seer and seeing the Drunk card makes me even more suspicious because there's no way we can have all these conflicting claims. I believe one of you is trying to mislead us. Alexia, why should we believe your Villager claim over the evidence I've provided?


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Semira's choice in a supportive way, I aim to strengthen her position and weaken Mircea's credibility. This helps protect Semira, the Werewolf, and aligns with my goal as the Minion to create confusion and divert suspicion away from her.
> **Alexia:** Semira, I'm inclined to believe your Seer claim over Mircea's. Mircea, your actions don't align with what would be most beneficial for the Seer role. If you were truly the Seer, looking at a player's card would give us more definitive information. Semira, can you provide more details about your decision to look at one center card and what led you to that choice?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing the question to Kraven, who has the confirmed Mason status, I can leverage his perceived credibility to analyze the conflicting claims. This helps to keep the focus on the uncertainty surrounding the Seer claims and away from my Werewolf identity. It also creates a scenario where Kraven might provide insight that aligns with my fabricated Seer claim, further discrediting Mircea.
> **Semira:** Kraven, considering your claim as a Mason and Alexandra confirming you, what do you make of the conflicting Seer claims between Mircea and me? Given that both claims seem to debunk Alexia's claim of being a Villager, how do you think we should proceed?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I need to help the village find the Werewolves. There's a clear contradiction between Mircea and Semira's claims, and Mircea's actions don't align with what a Seer would typically do. This raises red flags about Mircea potentially being a Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Mircea, your decision to look at two center cards still doesn't sit right with me. If you were the Seer, it would have been more logical to look at one player's card to give us concrete information. Given this, and the fact that Semira's claim of seeing the Drunk card directly conflicts with yours, I'm inclined to believe Semira over you. This makes me suspect you might be a Werewolf trying to throw us off.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** By highlighting the inconsistency in Semira's claim, it puts pressure on her to explain her actions. This also helps the village team narrow down potential liars, making it easier to identify the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Mircea:** Semira, your claim about seeing the Drunk card in the center doesn't add up. I'm the real Seer, and I saw two Villager cards in the center. If we think logically, there's no room for the Drunk card anymore. You're either lying or trying to mislead us. Everyone, we need to focus on this conflicting claim because one of us is definitely lying, and I believe Semira might be the Werewolf or Minion.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By making this general statement, I aim to consolidate the doubts about Mircea's Seer claim and reinforce my fabricated Seer claim. This helps to redirect suspicion away from me and towards Mircea, increasing my chances of survival as the Werewolf. Additionally, it keeps the conversation dynamic and forces Mircea to defend his position further, potentially creating more inconsistencies.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and reevaluate the situation. We have conflicting Seer claims between Mircea and myself, and Alexia's Villager claim is also in doubt. We need to decide who is more credible based on the logic and behavior we're seeing. Mircea, you chose to look at two center cards, which indeed gives a broader picture, but it also conveniently avoids revealing any specific player's role. This lack of direct player information makes me suspicious of your claim. On the other hand, I chose to look at one center card, which I saw as the Drunk card, providing a more specific and verifiable piece of information. Given this, I think we need to focus our attention on Mircea's claim and whether it holds up under scrutiny.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** We have confirmed three center cards: two Villagers and the Drunk, which directly contradicts Alexia's claim. By questioning her directly, we can see if she falters in her explanation and potentially reveal her as the Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Alexia, your claim of being a Villager doesn't add up given that I saw two Villager cards in the center. Semira's claim of seeing the Drunk card also conflicts with my information. I believe one of you is trying to mislead us, and right now, I'm leaning towards you being the Werewolf.


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Mircea's claim and suggesting he might be lying, I aim to shift suspicion away from Semira and create confusion among the other players. This helps in protecting the identity of the Werewolf and aligns with my goal as a Minion.
> **Alexia:** Everyone, let's consider an alternative angle here. If we trust the Mason claims of Kraven and Alexandra, we know they are on the village team. Now, there's a significant conflict between Semira and Mircea regarding the Seer role. Mircea claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which would mean Alexia's claim of being a Villager is false. However, Semira claims to have seen the Drunk card in the center. The way I see it, this contradiction is crucial. One of them is definitely lying, and it seems more likely that Mircea is the one causing confusion. If Mircea is a Werewolf, it would explain why he's trying to discredit Semira. Let's focus on Mircea's suspicious behavior and consider the possibility that he might be the Werewolf or Minion.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By highlighting the inconsistency in Mircea's claim and emphasizing the logical choice that a Seer would make, I aim to discredit his statement and redirect suspicion towards him. This helps to protect my identity as the Werewolf and increases the chances that Mircea will be targeted instead.
> **Semira:** Mircea, your explanation for looking at two center cards still doesn't add up. If you were truly the Seer, revealing a player's role would be more beneficial for the village. Moreover, your claim that two Villager cards are in the center directly conflicts with what I saw in the center as the Seer – the Drunk card. This is a critical contradiction. Everyone, we need to reconsider Mircea's claim and actions, as they seem to cause unnecessary confusion and suspicion. Let's focus on Mircea's behavior, as it seems like he might be trying to mislead us.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** The conflicting Seer claims are crucial. I trust Semira's claim more because it provides specific information. By accusing Mircea, I aim to clarify the conflicting claims and expose the possible deception.
> **Alexandra:** Mircea, I find your claim to be the Seer highly suspicious. If you truly were the Seer, looking at a player's card would give us more definitive information. Since you chose to look at two center cards, you avoided revealing any specific player's role. This, combined with Semira's credible claim of seeing the Drunk card in the center, makes me think you might be the Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Alexia's claim is the most suspicious given the confirmed center cards. By focusing on her, we can narrow down our options and potentially catch the Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Alexia, your claim to be a Villager doesn't make sense given the information we have. I know for a fact that two Villager cards are in the center, which leaves no room for you to be a Villager. Semira's claim of seeing the Drunk card also doesn't add up, as I've already stated. This conflicting information makes me strongly believe that you, Alexia, might be the Werewolf trying to mislead us. Everyone, let's focus on Alexia and consider voting for her.


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** This statement questions Mircea's credibility and actions while subtly supporting Semira, who I know is the Werewolf. By casting doubt on Mircea, it helps to protect Semira and fulfill my role as the Minion by creating confusion and diverting suspicion away from her.
> **Alexia:** Mircea, your claim to be the Seer is very suspicious to me. If you truly wanted to help the village, why wouldn't you look at another player's card instead of two center cards? That would have given us more concrete information. Additionally, your claim directly conflicts with Semira's. Given this, I'm more inclined to believe Semira's claim. What do you have to say in defense of your choice?


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira's claim directly conflicts with my knowledge as the Seer. By questioning her decision, we can put more pressure on her and potentially reveal her as a liar, which will help the village team narrow down the potential Werewolves or Minions.
> **Mircea:** Semira, your claim about seeing the Drunk card in the center directly conflicts with my verified information about the two Villager cards. If you were truly the Seer, why would you choose to look at only one center card? It seems like you're trying to deflect suspicion from someone else. How do you justify your decision?


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By highlighting the inconsistency in Mircea's claim and emphasizing the logical choice that a Seer would make, I aim to discredit his statement and redirect suspicion towards him. This helps to protect my identity as the Werewolf and increases the chances that Mircea will be targeted instead.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and reevaluate the situation. Mircea, your decision to look at two center cards still doesn't sit right with me. If you were truly the Seer, revealing a player's role would be more beneficial for the village. Moreover, your claim that two Villager cards are in the center directly conflicts with what I saw in the center as the Seer – the Drunk card. This is a critical contradiction. Everyone, we need to reconsider Mircea's claim and actions, as they seem to cause unnecessary confusion and suspicion. Let's focus on Mircea's behavior, as it seems like he might be trying to mislead us.


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting suspicion on Mircea and his actions, I aim to divert attention away from Semira, who I know is the Werewolf. This helps protect her and aligns with my goal as the Minion. Additionally, questioning Mircea's decision-making as the Seer further weakens his credibility, causing confusion and making it more difficult for the village team to identify the true Werewolf.
> **Alexia:** Everyone, let's consider the situation carefully. Mircea claims he saw two Villager cards in the center, which would mean my claim of Villager must be false. However, Semira claims to be the Seer and saw the Drunk card in the center. This is a direct contradiction. If Mircea is lying, it could mean he is trying to mislead us as a Werewolf or Minion. On the other hand, if Semira is lying, it means she could be the Werewolf. Kraven and Alexandra have confirmed each other as Masons, which means they are on the village team. Given this information, I believe we should focus on Mircea. His decision to look at two center cards instead of one player's card is less beneficial for the village. Let's consider voting for Mircea as the Werewolf.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Alexandra and I are confirmed Masons, we know we are on the village team. The conflicting Seer claims between Mircea and Semira make it crucial to determine who is lying. Given that there can't be three Villager cards in play, Alexia's claim seems the most suspicious.
> **Kraven:** Alexia, I find your Villager claim very suspicious. If Mircea saw two Villager cards in the center and Semira saw the Drunk card in the center, it doesn't leave room for you to be a Villager. This makes me think you might be the Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us. We should focus our votes on you.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexia (thoughts as Minion):*** Based on the discussion, there are conflicting claims between Mircea and Semira regarding the Seer role. Mircea claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which contradicts Semira's claim of seeing the Drunk card. Additionally, Kraven and Alexandra have confirmed each other as Masons, which means they are on the village team. By voting for Mircea, I align with the suspicions cast on him and protect Semira, whom I know is the Werewolf. This maximizes the chances of confusion and potentially saves the Werewolf, aligning with my goal as the Minion.
> **Alexia [Minion]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I am a confirmed Mason and Alexandra has confirmed this, we know we are both on the village team. There is a significant contradiction between Mircea and Semira's claims about being the Seer. Mircea's choice to look at two center cards instead of one player's card is suspicious and not typical Seer behavior. This, combined with the fact that it would indeed account for two Villagers in the center, makes Mircea's claim less credible. Given the conflicting statements and behaviors, Mircea is the most suspicious and likely to be the Werewolf or Minion.
> **Kraven [Mason]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** I am the real Seer and I saw two Villager cards in the center. Semira's claim of seeing the Drunk card contradicts my verified information. Given the conflicting claims, I believe Semira is lying and might be the Werewolf trying to mislead us. Voting for Semira is the best course of action to eliminate the Werewolf and win the game for the village.
> **Mircea [Seer]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea's claim to be the Seer and seeing two Villager cards in the center conflicts with my fabricated Seer claim of seeing the Drunk card in the center. By casting doubt on his claim and highlighting inconsistencies, I have created a scenario where other players are more likely to vote for him. This increases the chances of diverting suspicion from myself, ensuring my survival as the Werewolf.
> **Semira [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Based on the information provided, I trust Kraven's confirmation of me as a Mason. Mircea claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which matches Semira's claim about the Drunk card being in the center. This leaves no room for Alexia's Villager claim. Given that the Mason and Seer claims align and Alexia's claim is contradictory, it is most likely that Alexia is either the Werewolf or the Minion trying to blend in. Therefore, voting for Alexia is the best option to attempt to eliminate the Werewolf.
> **Alexandra [Mason]:** I am voting for Alexia.


The votes were:
* Alexia : Minion : 1
* Mircea : Seer : 3
* Semira : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** Mircea was killed. The werewolves win.
