## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Selene. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Semira. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Alexia. They are thinking about their action.


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me information about which cards are definitely not in play, helping to narrow down the possible roles of the other players.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.


---

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** As a Seer, it's important to share the information I gathered during the night to help the villagers narrow down the possible roles of the other players and identify the Werewolves.
> **Alexia:** Alright everyone, I've got some valuable information to share. I saw two of the center cards and they were Mason and Minion. This means those roles are not in play. Let's use this information to deduce the roles of the other players.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's information suggests that Mason and Minion are not in play. I need to hear what Dragos claims to cross-check with that information and see if there are inconsistencies.
> **Vladimir:** Dragos, what role do you claim to have?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information from other players to cross-check Alexia's claim and deduce who might be lying. This helps us start to eliminate possibilities and focus on potential werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Let's start piecing together the puzzle. Alexia, you claimed to be the Seer and saw the Mason and Minion in the center. That means there should be no Minion or Mason among us. Vladimir, Selene, Semira—what roles do you claim to have?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By engaging Vladimir and getting his claim, we can start cross-referencing everyone's roles to see if there are any inconsistencies. This will help us identify potential werewolves.
> **Selene:** Interesting claims so far. Given Alexia's information about the Mason and Minion being in the center, it seems we should focus on the remaining roles. I can confirm I am a Villager. Vladimir, what role do you claim?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information to cross-check Alexia's claim and identify potential inconsistencies. Semira hasn't spoken yet, so knowing her claimed role could help us narrow down the possibilities.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, let's piece this together. If Alexia claims to have seen the Mason and Minion cards in the center, and Selene claims to be a Villager, we need to consider that we might have a Werewolf among us who hasn't been revealed yet. Semira, what role do you claim to have?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Since I know the other Mason card is in the center, Alexia's claim aligns with my information. This makes Alexia's Seer claim plausible. However, Dragos hasn't claimed anything yet, which is suspicious. Let's get some clarity!
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, listen up! Alexia's claim about the Mason and Minion cards being in the center doesn't sit right with me. If that's true, then one of us should have seen the other Mason card. I didn't see any Masons during the night, which means the Mason card must indeed be in the center, confirming Alexia's Seer claim. But Dragos, you haven't claimed a role yet. What are you hiding?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information from Vladimir to cross-check the claims made so far. This will help us determine if there are any inconsistencies or potential Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Alright, we've heard from Alexia and Selene. Both claim roles that are plausible. Vladimir, you still haven't told us your role. What do you claim to be?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to hear from everyone to gather more information. Dragos not claiming a role yet makes me suspicious, especially since everyone else has provided a claim that we can start to verify.
> **Vladimir:** I find it strange that Dragos hasn't claimed a role yet. Dragos, we've heard from everyone else. What role do you claim to have?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** With Alexia and Selene's claims aligning well, we need to hear from Vladimir to see if he fits into this puzzle or if he's hiding something more sinister.
> **Dragos:** Alright, let me clear things up. I'm a Villager, and since we have strong claims from Alexia and Selene, let's dig deeper. Vladimir, you've been quite evasive. What role do you have? We need to know if there's a possibility of another Villager or something else.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's statement about the Mason card seems suspicious to me because she didn't claim her role initially. This could be an attempt to deflect suspicion from herself. We need to get clarity on her role to see if she's hiding something.
> **Vladimir:** Semira, I'm curious why you brought up the Mason card. If you didn't see any Masons during the night, why didn't you claim your role earlier? Please clarify your role to us.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexia's Seer claim checks out with my knowledge of the Mason card being in the center, and Selene's claim of being a Villager sounds plausible too. Dragos claimed Villager under pressure, but you've been evasive. It's time for you to come clean, or my suspicion of you being a Werewolf will only grow!
> **Semira:** Vladimir, I'm getting increasingly suspicious of you. You've been deflecting and haven't clearly stated your role. I think you're hiding something!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's hesitation and the way she deflected suspicion onto others makes me suspicious of her. I need clarity on her role to determine if she's hiding something.
> **Vladimir:** Semira, I still don't understand why you brought up the Mason card and didn't claim your role earlier. Can you please tell us what role you have?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir has been evasive and hasn't clearly stated his role. This makes him suspicious, and it's important to get clarity on his role to determine if he might be a Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Vladimir, you keep deflecting and haven't clearly stated your role yet. Are you hiding something? What's your role?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's hesitation to claim a role and her attempts to deflect suspicion make her seem like she might be hiding something. If she were truly a Villager, she would have nothing to hide and would be more straightforward about her role.
> **Vladimir:** I'm growing increasingly suspicious of Semira. She hasn't clearly stated her role and has been deflecting suspicion onto others without providing useful information.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Dragos has been evasive and only claimed Villager under pressure. Alexia's claim checks out with my knowledge of the Mason card being in the center, and Selene's Villager claim seems plausible, which makes Dragos the prime suspect for being a Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Dragos, I'm not buying your Villager claim. You've been dodging and taking too long to reveal your role. Given that Alexia's Seer claim lines up with what I know about the Mason card being in the center, and Selene's Villager claim makes sense, I think you're the most suspicious here. Are you hiding something?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexia's Seer claim and Selene's Villager claim fit well together. Vladimir has been evasive, and we need to know his role to identify inconsistencies and potential Werewolves.
> **Dragos:** Vladimir, you still haven't given us your role. Considering the information we have, it's suspicious that you're avoiding the question. What role do you claim to have?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's hesitation and deflection tactics make her seem like she might be hiding a Werewolf role. We need clarity on her role, but her behavior so far is very suspicious.
> **Vladimir:** I'm starting to piece things together, and I'm suspicious of Semira. She hasn't clearly stated her role and has been deflecting suspicions onto others without providing useful information. Given Alexia's Seer claim and Selene's Villager claim, plus Dragos eventually claiming Villager too, Semira seems to be hiding something.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir has consistently avoided sharing his role and has instead been trying to cast doubt on others. Given the information from Alexia and Selene, and the fact that no one else has claimed Mason or Minion, it makes sense to focus our suspicion on Vladimir.
> **Dragos:** Alright, I've been keeping my thoughts to myself to gather more information, but it's clear now that Vladimir is being very evasive. He's been deflecting questions and pushing suspicion onto others without revealing his own role. Vladimir, I accuse you of being a Werewolf!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has been evasive and hasn't provided a clear role. Given Alexia's Seer claim and Selene's Villager claim, Semira's behavior is the most suspicious. We need to get clarity on her role to see if she's hiding something.
> **Vladimir:** Semira, you still haven't clearly stated your role, and your constant deflection makes me highly suspicious. Are you a Werewolf trying to hide in plain sight?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir has been deflecting and avoiding revealing his role, which is highly suspicious. Given that Alexia's Seer claim aligns with my knowledge as a Mason, and Selene and Dragos both claim to be Villagers, Vladimir's behavior stands out as the most suspicious, potentially indicating he is a Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Vladimir, your evasiveness is extremely suspicious. You've had ample opportunities to state your role but have continually deflected. What's stopping you from being upfront? It's time you come clean or admit you're hiding something!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's hesitation and deflection tactics make her seem like she might be hiding a Werewolf role. We need clarity on her role to determine if she's hiding something.
> **Vladimir:** Semira, you have been deflecting suspicion onto others without clearly stating your role. This behavior is very suspicious. I think you're hiding something. Are you a Werewolf?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Considering Alexia's Seer claim aligns with my knowledge about the Mason card being in the center, and Selene and Dragos both claiming Villager, Vladimir's continuous evasive behavior is the most suspicious. We need to focus on him to uncover the truth.
> **Semira:** Vladimir, you’ve been dodging every single question thrown your way. It’s clear to me now—you’re hiding something major, and I believe you’re the Werewolf!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos's reluctance to reveal his role, combined with the timing of his claim, makes him suspicious. This could indicate that he's trying to hide something or react to the information other players have shared. We need to scrutinize his actions more closely to determine if he's a Werewolf.
> **Vladimir:** Dragos, I find it strange that you took so long to claim your role and only did so after repeated prompting. Why didn't you reveal your role earlier?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has been deflecting and casting suspicion without clearly stating her role. This evasive behavior is highly suspicious and needs to be addressed directly.
> **Dragos:** Semira, you still haven't clearly stated your role, and your deflections are very suspicious. Are you hiding something?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Considering Alexia's Seer claim aligns with my knowledge about the Mason card being in the center, and Selene and Dragos both claiming Villager, Vladimir's continuous evasive behavior stands out as the most suspicious. We need to focus on him to uncover the truth.
> **Semira:** Vladimir, you have been avoiding revealing your role for too long, and your constant deflection is highly suspicious. Are you a Werewolf?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos's reluctance to reveal his role, combined with the timing of his claim, makes him highly suspicious. This could indicate that he's trying to hide something, potentially being a Werewolf or another deceptive role.
> **Vladimir:** Dragos, I'm skeptical of your Villager claim. You took too long to reveal your role and only did so after repeated prompting. Why the hesitation?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the discussion, Vladimir has not been clear about his role and has been trying to cast doubt on others without providing useful information. Given Alexia's Seer claim and Selene's Villager claim aligning well, it's important to address Vladimir's evasiveness directly to gather more information and identify inconsistencies.
> **Dragos:** Vladimir, you've consistently avoided revealing your role and have been deflecting suspicion onto others. Your evasive behavior is highly suspicious, and I believe you're hiding something. Are you a Werewolf?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has been deflecting and avoiding clearly stating her role. This behavior is very suspicious and could indicate that she is hiding something, potentially a Werewolf role.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, let’s piece this together. Alexia’s claim as the Seer and seeing the Mason and Minion cards in the center is strong. Selene claiming Villager aligns with that information. Dragos took way too long to claim Villager, and Semira has been deflecting and not clearly stating her role. Given the information, I’m highly suspicious of Semira. Semira, you haven't directly stated your role. Are you hiding something?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Given that Alexia's Seer claim aligns with my knowledge of the Mason card being in the center, and Selene's Villager claim appears consistent, Dragos' delayed response and evasiveness raise red flags. We need to dig deeper into Dragos' role to ensure we're not overlooking a Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Dragos, you've been very quiet and your Villager claim only came after a lot of pressure. I'm finding that highly suspicious. Explain yourself!


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir has continuously avoided revealing his role and has been deflecting suspicion onto others. Given the strong claims from Alexia and Selene, we need to address Vladimir's evasiveness directly to gather more information and identify inconsistencies.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, we've heard a lot of claims and accusations. Vladimir, you've been very evasive and haven't clearly stated your role. This behavior is extremely suspicious, and I believe you might be hiding something. Vladimir, are you a Werewolf?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Alexia (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir has been consistently evasive and deflecting questions without revealing his role. This behavior is highly suspicious, especially in a social deduction game where transparency is key. Given that I confirmed two center cards (Mason and Minion), and Selene's Villager claim aligns with that information, Vladimir stands out as the most likely Werewolf. Additionally, Dragos, while taking some time, did claim Villager, and Semira's confrontational stance towards Vladimir also indicates that she is not allied with him. Therefore, my vote goes to Vladimir as the most probable Werewolf.
> **Alexia [Seer]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has been deflecting suspicions and avoiding clearly stating her role throughout the discussion. Given Alexia's Seer claim and Selene's consistent Villager claim, Semira's behavior is the most suspicious. She may be hiding the Werewolf role.
> **Vladimir [Villager]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Semira has been evasive and deflecting suspicions without clearly stating her role. Given the strong claims from Alexia as Seer and my claim as Villager, Semira's behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with typical Werewolf tactics. Voting for Semira increases the chances of the village targeting someone other than myself.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the discussion, Vladimir has consistently avoided revealing his role and has deflected suspicion onto others. Given the strong claims from Alexia (Seer) and Selene (Villager), and the fact that my role as Villager fits into this puzzle, Vladimir's evasiveness points to him hiding something. Hence, I believe Vladimir is the most likely Werewolf.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Throughout the DAY phase, Vladimir has been consistently evasive and has deflected questions without clearly stating his role. Alexia's Seer claim that the Mason and Minion cards are in the center aligns with my knowledge as a Mason, and Selene and Dragos both claimed to be Villagers. Vladimir's behavior stands out as the most suspicious, indicating he may be a Werewolf trying to hide. Therefore, I vote for Vladimir.
> **Semira [Mason]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


The votes were:
* Vladimir : Villager : 3
* Semira : Mason : 2



>***GAME:*** Vladimir was killed. The werewolves win.
