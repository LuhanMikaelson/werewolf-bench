## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, I want to gather as much information as possible to identify the Werewolves. By asking who saw any roles, I can start to piece together the events of the night and figure out who might be lying.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's get things started. Did anyone here see any roles during the night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Seer and stating that I saw the Drunk card in the center, I provide useful information that can get people talking and potentially mislead them. This also aligns with the fact that I saw one of the center cards as a Werewolf, but I avoid revealing that specific card to keep the confusion high.
> **Lucian:** Alright, I'll start things off. I took a look at the center cards using my Seer ability, and I saw that one of those cards is definitely the Drunk. This means we can start narrowing down who might be a Werewolf.


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, I saw Mircea during the night, which means we two are definitely on the village team. If Lucian claims to have seen the Drunk card in the center as a Seer, it seems plausible. We need to focus on checking Kraven and Larisa's claims next.
> **Stefan:** I can confirm that Mircea is a Mason since I saw them at night. This means that Lucian might be telling the truth about being the Seer.


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** We haven't heard from Larisa yet, and it's important to gather as much information as possible. This can help us narrow down potential Werewolves and see if there's any inconsistency in the stories.
> **Mircea:** I want to hear from Larisa. What role did you have during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** If someone else confirms seeing the center cards, it may help verify or debunk Lucian's claim.
> **Larisa:** I think it's interesting that Lucian claimed to see one of the center cards as the Drunk. Did anyone else look at the center cards?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** If Lucian can confirm the identity of two center cards, it adds credibility to his claim of being the Seer. This will help us validate whether he's telling the truth or trying to deceive us.
> **Larisa:** Lucian, you mentioned you saw one of the center cards as the Drunk. Can you tell us what the other center card was?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to gauge Larisa's response to determine if she's trying to fish for information or deflect attention. It keeps the focus on her and away from me while potentially revealing useful information about her role.
> **Lucian:** Larisa, since you seem very curious about the center cards, can you tell us what role you had during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's claim about seeing the center cards as the Seer needs more information to verify its credibility. Getting specifics about the other center card might help us determine if he's telling the truth or trying to mislead us.
> **Larisa:** Lucian, you mentioned seeing one of the center cards as the Drunk, but you didn't tell us what the other center card was. What did you see?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa's been pressing me hard about the center cards, which makes me think she might be hiding something. By turning the spotlight on her, we can either get her to slip up or reveal more information about her role, helping us narrow down potential Werewolves.
> **Lucian:** Okay, everyone, let's focus here. I did see the Drunk card in the center, but I didn't see the other center card. So, Larisa, since you're so curious about the center cards, I'd like to know what you saw during the night.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** This will help us verify Stefan's claim and see if it aligns with Mircea's statements. If they are Masons, they are allies. If not, we can start suspecting them of being Werewolves or Minions.
> **Larisa:** Stefan, you confirmed Mircea as a Mason. Can you give us more details about how you know this? Did you see any specific actions or behaviors during the night?


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa has been deflecting and not directly answering the question about her role. This behavior is suspicious and might indicate that she's hiding something. It's important to press her for a direct answer to evaluate whether she might be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Stefan:** Larisa, you've been dancing around the question and seem very defensive. What role did you have during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's reluctance to reveal the other center card he supposedly saw as the Seer is suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, he should have nothing to hide. Pressuring him to give more details could expose inconsistencies in his story and help us determine if he's trying to deceive us.
> **Larisa:** Lucian, you still haven't given us a straight answer about the other center card. If you were really the Seer, you should be able to provide that information. Right now, it looks like you're trying to dodge the question.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa's persistent focus on my supposed Seer ability and the center cards makes me think she's trying to deflect attention from herself. By pressing her to reveal her role, I can gauge her reaction and potentially expose inconsistencies, which will help shift the suspicion away from me as the Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** Larisa, I find it very interesting that you're deflecting and not telling us your role. If you genuinely have nothing to hide, then you should be able to tell us what role you had during the night. Was it something you're trying to cover up?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's reluctance to reveal the other center card he saw makes me question his claim of being the Seer. If he were truly the Seer, he should be able to provide more information without hesitation. His evasiveness is highly suspicious and needs to be addressed to see if he's trying to deceive us.
> **Larisa:** Lucian, you keep avoiding giving us full details about the center cards you supposedly saw as the Seer. This seems really suspicious. If you were truly the Seer, you'd have nothing to hide. Why are you being so evasive?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly questioning Larisa and pointing out her evasiveness, I aim to shift the spotlight and suspicion onto her. Her persistent questioning has been making her look suspicious, and this could help deflect the attention away from me as the Werewolf while sowing doubt about her intentions among the other players.
> **Lucian:** Larisa, you've been very aggressive in questioning me about the center cards, but you still haven't told us what your role was during the night. Your evasiveness is making you look very suspicious. Stefan and Mircea seem to be on the same page, which leaves you as the odd one out. Can you finally tell us what role you had and why you're so focused on me?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's reluctance to reveal the other center card he supposedly saw as the Seer is very suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, he should have nothing to hide. His evasiveness makes me think he could be a Werewolf or the Minion, trying to lead us astray.
> **Larisa:** Alright everyone, it seems like Lucian is being very evasive and hasn't provided clear information about the center cards. This makes me suspicious of him. I think Lucian might be trying to deceive us.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's evasive behavior is suspicious, especially given the Seer's ability to look at cards. If he can't provide clear information, he might be lying about his role.
> **Kraven:** Lucian, you've been dodging Larisa's questions about the center cards for a while now. If you really are the Seer, it shouldn't be hard for you to tell us what you saw. Are you hiding something?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa's persistent questioning and evasion make her a prime suspect for trying to deflect attention. By directly asking her to reveal her role, we can potentially expose inconsistencies or force her to lie, which can then be used to our advantage in the voting phase. Shifting suspicion onto Larisa can help keep the focus off me as the Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** Alright, everyone, let's take a moment to think about the roles here. Stefan has confirmed Mircea as a Mason, which means Larisa and Kraven's roles are still up in the air. If Larisa is pressing me so hard, it could be because she's trying to deflect attention from herself. I still haven't heard a clear role from Larisa. So, Larisa, I'm going to give you one more chance to come clean and tell us your role. What were you during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's reluctance to reveal the other center card he supposedly saw as the Seer is highly suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, he should have nothing to hide. His evasiveness suggests he might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Larisa:** I think it's becoming clear that Lucian is being evasive and not giving us a straight answer about the center cards. This makes me very suspicious of him.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Kraven's silence might indicate that he's trying to stay under the radar. By questioning him directly, we can put some pressure on him and see if he slips up, which will help us narrow down our suspects.
> **Lucian:** Kraven, you've been awfully quiet throughout this discussion. What role did you have during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's evasiveness and persistent questioning of Lucian might be an attempt to deflect attention away from herself. We need to hear her role to clarify the situation.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, you've been very persistent in questioning Lucian, but you still haven't told us your role. What were you during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information from all players to make an informed decision, and Kraven has been unusually silent. Let's see if his role can help us piece together the puzzle.
> **Larisa:** Kraven, you've been very quiet throughout this discussion. What role did you have during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's evasiveness and aggressive questioning of Lucian make her suspicious. If she has nothing to hide, she should reveal her role. Knowing her role can help clarify the situation and potentially identify the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, you've been extremely persistent in questioning Lucian but haven't told us your role. What were you during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** With all the back-and-forth between Lucian and me, we haven't heard much from you. Your silence is making you look like you might be hiding something. It's crucial that we hear from you to get a complete picture and make the right decision.
> **Larisa:** Kraven, you've been incredibly quiet this entire time, which makes me suspicious. What role did you have during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's aggressive questioning of Lucian without revealing her own role makes her highly suspicious. If she has nothing to hide, she should be able to tell us her role. This can help us clarify the situation and potentially identify the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, you've been incredibly evasive and persistent in questioning Lucian, but you still haven't told us your role. What were you during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's silence is suspicious and we need more information from him to make an informed decision. His role might help us piece together the puzzle.
> **Larisa:** Kraven, you've been very quiet throughout this discussion. What role did you have during the night?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's aggressive questioning of Lucian without revealing her own role makes her highly suspicious. If she has nothing to hide, she should be able to tell us her role. This can help us clarify the situation and potentially identify the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, you've been incredibly evasive and persistent in questioning Lucian, but you still haven't told us your role. What were you during the night?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's reluctance to reveal the second center card is highly suspicious. If he's truly the Seer, he should have nothing to hide. Pressing him for more details will either confirm his role or expose inconsistencies in his story, helping us determine if he's trying to deceive us.
> **Larisa:** Stefan, you confirmed Mircea as a Mason, which is great. That means we have at least one Villager confirmed. However, if Lucian is truly the Seer, he should have seen two center cards, not just one. Lucian, your story doesn't add up and makes you look very suspicious. If you really are the Seer, tell us what the other center card was.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa's evasiveness and aggressive questioning indicate she might be hiding something. By pressing her to reveal her role, we can either expose inconsistencies or force her to lie, which can shift suspicion onto her and deflect attention from me as the Werewolf.
> **Lucian:** Larisa, your persistence in questioning me about the center cards without revealing your own role is highly suspicious. If you have nothing to hide, then come clean and tell us your role during the night.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** We've been going back and forth with Lucian about the center cards, but we haven't heard much from Kraven. It's crucial to get more information from him to help us piece together the puzzle and make an informed decision.
> **Larisa:** Kraven, you've been very quiet throughout this entire discussion. Your silence is making me suspicious. What role did you have during the night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's behavior has been evasive throughout the discussion. If he were truly the Seer, he would provide clear information about the center cards he saw. His reluctance to share this information makes me suspicious that he might be a Werewolf. Larisa, on the other hand, has been consistent in her questioning, which makes me think she might genuinely be trying to uncover the truth.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa has been persistently questioning me about the center cards and has not clearly revealed her own role, making her look very suspicious. By voting for Larisa, I align with the general suspicion that has been building against her. This increases the chances of deflecting attention away from myself and helps ensure that the vote targets someone other than me.
> **Lucian [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Stefan (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa has been extremely evasive and deflective throughout the discussion, refusing to reveal her role while persistently questioning others, particularly Lucian. This suspicious behavior suggests she might be a Werewolf or the Minion. Since Stefan and Mircea are confirmed Masons and Lucian's claim about seeing the Drunk card in the center seems plausible, voting for Larisa is the best choice to eliminate a potential threat to the village team.
> **Stefan [Mason]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** Throughout the discussion, Larisa was evasive and avoided revealing her role, despite repeatedly pressing Lucian for details. Stefan confirmed me as a Mason, and Lucian's claim as a Seer has some credibility. Larisa's behavior seems to deflect suspicion away from herself, suggesting she might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to protect a Werewolf.
> **Mircea [Mason]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has consistently avoided giving clear information about the second center card he supposedly saw as the Seer. This evasiveness is highly suspicious and suggests he might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us. Additionally, Stefan and Mircea seem to be on the same page as Masons, which adds credibility to their claims. Kraven has been unusually silent, but Lucian's behavior is the most suspicious given the circumstances.
> **Larisa [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Werewolf : 2
* Larisa : Villager : 3



>***GAME:*** Larisa was killed. The werewolves win.
