## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Ileana. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Michael is a minion and is aware that Ileana is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dracula. They are thinking about their action.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gain information that will help me deduce which roles are in play and potentially identify if there are any Werewolves or the Minion among the remaining players. This will give me a strategic advantage during the Day phase discussions by either confirming or ruling out certain roles.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Since I am actually the Werewolf and saw that the other Werewolf card was in the center, I know Dracula cannot be the Minion. However, by claiming to be the Seer and saying I saw his card, I can cast strong suspicion on Dracula and make the others want to eliminate him. This will help hide my true identity as the Werewolf and hopefully get the village team to waste their elimination vote on an innocent player like Dracula. Aggressively accusing someone else is a good way to divert attention from myself.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, I noticed you were very quiet during the night phase. As the Seer, I looked at one of your cards and saw that you are the Minion! You've been working with the Werewolves all along, haven't you? I think it's clear that Dracula is not on the village team and should be eliminated.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** I viewed two center cards as the Seer, and they were a Mason and a Villager. Given this information, Ileana's claim seems suspicious and counterproductive to the village's goal.
> **Dracula:** Ileana, that's quite an accusation! I know for a fact that there is a Mason and a Villager in the center. This means that there's a good chance you're lying about being the Seer, because the Seer wouldn't have seen my card and claimed it was something it wasn't.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to have also seen Marius' card and that it was a Villager, I can build trust with Marius and make him more likely to believe my accusation against Dracula. This will further isolate Dracula and cast suspicion on him, taking the heat off of me. Boldly claiming to be the Seer and have knowledge of multiple people's roles makes me sound authoritative and trustworthy, even though I'm bluffing.
> **Ileana:** Marius, you've been pretty quiet too. As the Seer, I also happened to see one of your cards. And guess what? It was a Villager card! So I think we can trust that Marius is on the village team. Dracula on the other hand, is definitely suspicious. He's trying to cast doubt on my role, but I know what I saw.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** It's crucial to verify the validity of both Ileana's and Dracula's claims. Ileana's accusation is strong, but I want to understand Dracula's basis for his counter-claim before making any judgment. This can help us determine who might be lying.
> **Marius:** Ileana, you're claiming to be the Seer, which is a very important role for the village. If you truly saw that Dracula is the Minion, then we need to be very cautious about the possibility of Werewolves around. But Dracula, if you're saying that there is a Mason and Villager in the center, can you clarify how you know this information? Did you look at the center cards somehow?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to cast doubt on Ileana's claim and get Marius to question her credibility. By pointing out the inconsistency in her story, I can help shift suspicion away from myself and towards her.
> **Dracula:** Marius, you heard Ileana accusing me of being the Minion and claiming to be the Seer. But if she truly were the Seer, she would have reliable information. I looked at the center cards and saw a Mason and a Villager. This means Ileana is lying about her Seer role. What do you think about this inconsistency?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to understand Ileana's thought process and verify if her actions align with typical Seer behavior. This will help us determine her credibility.
> **Marius:** Ileana, I'm inclined to believe your claim as the Seer, but I'm curious why you chose to look at my card if you suspected Dracula. Can you explain your reasoning behind checking my card?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to convince Marius that I had good reasons for checking his card, so that he continues to trust me. By explaining that I verified he was a Villager, it makes me seem like I'm working to figure out who is on the village team. I also need to cast more doubt on Dracula by pointing out how suspicious it is that he claims to know information about the center cards. Questioning how Dracula could have seen the center cards sows mistrust and makes him look like he's lying and actually a Werewolf or Minion. I'm trying to get Marius to focus his suspicion on Dracula and view me as an ally.
> **Ileana:** Marius, I looked at your card because I wanted to confirm that you were indeed a Villager and on the side of the village. By verifying your role, it helps me know who I can trust. As for why I checked Dracula - he was acting quite suspicious during the night phase which made me want to investigate him. When I saw he was the Minion, it all made sense. Dracula's behavior has been very odd...he claims to have seen the center cards, but how could he have done that unless he's a special role? I think he's lying to cover up the fact that he's working with the Werewolves!


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim as the Seer needs to be validated, and if Dracula has seen the center cards, he needs to explain how. This can help us determine if someone is lying and identify potential Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Dracula, your claim about knowing the center cards is very specific. How exactly did you get this information? Were you a Seer or did you swap roles somehow?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana's claim of being the Seer is inconsistent because she couldn't have seen both my card and Marius's card. By pointing this out to Marius, I aim to shift suspicion towards Ileana and protect myself.
> **Dracula:** Marius, if Ileana is truly the Seer, she wouldn't have seen both my card and yours. It doesn't add up. Ileana is lying to protect herself. We need to focus on her and question her motives.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's information about the center cards needs to be validated. If he truly saw the Mason and Villager in the center, he must have had some night action that allowed him to do so. By questioning him, we can determine if he's lying and potentially working with the Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Dracula, your claim about knowing the center cards is very specific. How exactly did you get this information? Were you a Seer or did you swap roles somehow?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to cast doubt on Ileana's claim and shift suspicion towards her. By pointing out the inconsistency in her story, I can get Marius to question her credibility and protect myself.
> **Dracula:** Marius, I am the Seer and I looked at two center cards. They were a Mason and a Villager. Ileana's claim doesn't add up because she said she looked at both your card and mine. That's impossible for a Seer to do in one night.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** I want Dracula to explain why he didn't counter Ileana's Seer claim immediately, which would help validate or refute his claim. This can reveal inconsistencies and help identify if he's the Minion or a Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Dracula, your claim of being the Seer and having looked at two center cards is very specific. However, it contradicts Ileana's claim that she saw both mine and your card. If Ileana is lying, she must be doing so to protect herself or the Werewolves. But if you're lying, you're either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us. I need to know: If you truly are the Seer, why didn't you reveal this information earlier when Ileana first claimed to be the Seer?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** The Seer can only look at one player's card or two center cards. Ileana's claim of seeing both my and Marius's cards is inconsistent with the Seer's abilities. By pointing this out, we can shift suspicion towards Ileana and protect myself.
> **Dracula:** Listen everyone, Ileana's claim to be the Seer and having seen both my card and Marius's card is suspicious and doesn't add up. As the Seer, I know that there is a Mason and a Villager in the center. This means Ileana is lying about her role. We need to focus on her and question her motives.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana's claim seems very suspicious and inconsistent with the Seer's abilities. By asking Radu for his input, we might get additional information that can help us identify whether Ileana is lying or if there are any Werewolves or Minions among us.
> **Dracula:** Radu, you've been very quiet during this discussion. What's your role and do you have any information that can help clarify this situation?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's hesitation to counter Ileana's Seer claim is highly suspicious. A real Seer would have immediately corrected any false information to help the village. This inconsistency makes me question Dracula's true role and intentions.
> **Radu:** Dracula, you claim to be the Seer and that you saw two center cards: a Mason and a Villager. Ileana is also claiming to be the Seer but with conflicting information. If you're truly the Seer, why didn't you immediately counter her claim when she first stated it? What were you waiting for?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Radu's question directly, I can clarify my actions and further cast doubt on Ileana's claim. This will help shift suspicion towards Ileana and protect myself as the true Seer.
> **Dracula:** Radu, I understand your concern. The reason I didn't immediately counter Ileana's claim is because I was trying to assess the situation and gather more information. Now that we've heard Ileana's inconsistent claims, it's clear to me that she's lying about being the Seer. I can confirm that I saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. Ileana is trying to mislead us, and we need to focus on her.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's hesitation to counter Ileana's Seer claim is highly suspicious. A real Seer would have immediately corrected any false information to help the village. This inconsistency makes me question Dracula's true role and intentions.
> **Radu:** Dracula, if you truly are the Seer, why did you not immediately correct Ileanaâ€™s claim when she first stated it? It seems odd that you would wait. Were you trying to gather information or were you trying to cover up something?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By addressing Radu directly and pointing out the inconsistency in Ileana's claim, we can shift suspicion towards her and protect myself as the true Seer. This will help us identify the real threat to the village.
> **Dracula:** Radu, I need you to listen carefully. Ileana's claim doesn't make sense because the Seer can only look at one player's card or two center cards, not both. She's trying to mislead us. I looked at two cards in the center and saw a Mason and a Villager. This makes her story impossible. We need to question Ileana's motives.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** A real Seer would have corrected false information right away to help the village. Dracula's delay in countering Ileana's claim casts doubt on his true role. It's more likely that he's the Minion or a Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Radu:** Dracula, your story doesn't add up. If you were really the Seer and saw two center cards, you should have immediately called out Ileana's false claim. Your hesitation is suspicious.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana's claim is inconsistent with the Seer's abilities. By directly addressing her and pointing out the flaw in her story, we can shift suspicion towards her and protect myself as the true Seer.
> **Dracula:** Ileana, your claim to be the Seer doesn't add up. The Seer can only look at one player's card or two center cards, not both. You're trying to mislead us. I looked at two cards in the center and saw a Mason and a Villager. This makes your story impossible. We need to question Ileana's motives.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to double down on my accusation of Dracula and make the others believe that he is lying about being the Seer. By questioning why he waited so long to share the information about the center cards, I can make him look even more untrustworthy. I have to be firm in insisting I am the real Seer and that I'm certain Dracula is the Minion. Appealing to Radu and Marius to trust me is key - I want them to view me as their ally against the Werewolf team. The more I can keep the spotlight on Dracula and his suspicious claims, the more I can divert attention away from myself as the actual Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, you're trying to turn this around on me but it won't work. I am the true Seer and I know what I saw - you are the Minion working with the Werewolves! If you really looked at two center cards, why didn't you share that information earlier? You're only bringing it up now to cast doubt on me. But I firmly believe that you are not on the village team. Radu and Marius, you need to trust me on this. Dracula's behavior and claims are highly suspicious!


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana's claim contradicts the Seer's abilities. By pointing this out to Marius, I can help shift suspicion towards Ileana and protect myself as the true Seer.
> **Dracula:** Marius, think about it logically. Ileana's claim is inconsistent with the Seer's abilities. She's trying to mislead us by saying she saw both my card and yours. That's not possible for a Seer. I need you to see through her lies.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to gather more information from Radu, who has been relatively quiet. His perspective could help clarify the situation and provide additional insights into who might be lying.
> **Marius:** Radu, I'm curious about your thoughts on the current situation. We've heard a lot from Ileana and Dracula, but you've been relatively quiet. What do you make of their conflicting claims?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** A real Seer would prioritize dispelling false claims as soon as possible to aid the village team. Dracula's delay undermines his credibility and suggests he might be attempting to mislead us.
> **Radu:** Dracula, your hesitation to challenge Ileana's claim right away is very suspicious to me. If you were really the Seer, you would have corrected her immediately to help the village. Why did you wait so long to bring up your information?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana's claim contradicts the mechanics of the Seer's abilities, which casts serious doubt on her credibility. Pointing this out to Marius will help shift suspicion towards Ileana and protect myself as the true Seer.
> **Dracula:** Marius, listen to me. Ileana's claim is fundamentally flawed. The Seer can only look at one player's card or two center cards, but not both. If she truly were the Seer, she wouldn't have been able to see both your card and mine. This inconsistency proves she's lying. We need to trust the evidence and focus on Ileana.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's hesitation to challenge Ileana's Seer claim right away is highly suspicious and doesn't align with the behavior of a Seer. His delayed response makes it seem like he's trying to fabricate a story to mislead us. Ileana's consistent and confident claims seem more reliable.
> **Marius:** Dracula, your story has too many holes and inconsistencies. If you were truly the Seer, you should have immediately countered Ileana's claim. Instead, you waited and only brought up the center cards when you were pressed for information. I think you might be the Minion or even a Werewolf trying to cover your tracks.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana's claim contradicts the mechanics of the Seer's abilities, which casts serious doubt on her credibility. By pointing this out to everyone, I aim to shift suspicion towards Ileana and protect myself as the true Seer. My information about the center cards (Mason and Villager) is reliable and should be trusted.
> **Dracula:** Everyone, listen to me! Ileana's story has a major flaw. As the Seer, you can only check one player's card or two center cards, not both. Ileana claimed to see both my card and Marius's card, which is impossible. This inconsistency proves that she is lying. If Ileana was truly the Seer, she would have known better. We need to focus on Ileana!


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's delayed response and conflicting statements are highly suspicious. As a Villager, it's crucial to expose any potential Werewolves or the Minion trying to mislead us. Ileana's consistent claim as the Seer seems more reliable, so it's important to challenge Dracula's credibility.
> **Marius:** Dracula, your story has too many inconsistencies. If you were truly the Seer, you would have immediately countered Ileana's claim instead of waiting. Everyone, we need to focus on Dracula because his behavior and conflicting statements point towards him being the Minion or a Werewolf.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By pointing out the inconsistency in Ileana's claim and directly asking Radu for his input, we can hopefully shift suspicion towards Ileana and protect myself as the true Seer.
> **Dracula:** Radu, I've been consistent with my claim and reasoning from the start. Ileana, on the other hand, claimed to see both my card and Marius's card, which is impossible for a Seer. This inconsistency leads me to believe that Ileana is lying about her role. What do you think about this contradiction?


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** A true Seer would prioritize dispelling false claims to aid the village. Dracula's delay and inconsistencies undermine his credibility. Ileana's detailed narrative makes more sense, so it's more likely Dracula is trying to deceive us.
> **Radu:** Ileana, your claim to be the Seer has been consistent and detailed, while Dracula's responses have been full of hesitation and inconsistencies. Dracula, you should have immediately countered Ileana's claim if you were truly the Seer. Everyone, I think Dracula is either the Minion or a Werewolf and is trying to mislead us.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Based on the discussions during the day phase, I believe voting for Dracula is the best play. Dracula's claims and behavior have been inconsistent and suspicious throughout the game. He claimed to be the Seer and to have seen the center cards, but only brought this up when pressed for information and to cast doubt on my role. If Dracula was truly the Seer, he should have immediately countered my claim when I first stated it. His hesitation and timing are highly suspect. Additionally, Dracula has not been able to provide a convincing explanation for why he waited so long to share the information about the center cards. This makes me believe he is lying about his role and is actually the Minion working with the Werewolves, or possibly even a Werewolf himself. By voting for Dracula, I can cast further suspicion on him and make the other players more likely to vote for him as well. This increases the chances of voting out someone other than myself, which is crucial since I am the sole Werewolf. Directing the vote towards Dracula is the best way to protect my identity and eliminate a village team member.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana's claim to be the Seer is inconsistent with the Seer's abilities. She stated that she looked at both my card and Marius's card, which is impossible as the Seer can only look at one player's card or two center cards. This contradiction strongly suggests that she is lying about her role. By voting for Ileana, we can eliminate the possibility of her being an impostor, likely a Werewolf or Minion, and protect the village.
> **Dracula [Seer]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's delayed response and conflicting statements are highly suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, he would have immediately countered Ileana's claim. Instead, he waited and only brought up the center cards when pressed for information. Ileana's consistent and detailed claims seem more reliable. Voting for Dracula seems like the best way to expose a potential Minion or Werewolf.
> **Marius [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Radu (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's hesitation to immediately counter Ileana's claim as the Seer is highly suspicious. If Dracula were truly the Seer, he would have corrected her false information to help the village. His delay and the inconsistencies in his story suggest he is trying to mislead us. Ileana's narrative has been consistent and logical, making it more likely that she is the true Seer. Therefore, I believe Dracula is either the Minion or a Werewolf and should be voted out.
> **Radu [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Dracula's claim of being the Seer and having seen two center cards contradicts Ileana's consistent and detailed Seer claim. Ileana's claim that Dracula is the Minion aligns with my knowledge as the Minion. Voting for Dracula increases the chance of voting out someone other than the Werewolf (Ileana). Additionally, I hope to sway the rest of the village to vote for Dracula based on the inconsistencies in his story.
> **Michael [Minion]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Ileana : Werewolf : 1
* Dracula : Seer : 4



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
