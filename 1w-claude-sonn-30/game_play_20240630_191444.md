## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Kraven. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Mircea is a minion and is aware that Kraven is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Selene. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Marius. They are thinking about their action.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can either confirm that certain roles are in the center and not in play, or possibly identify one or more werewolf roles, which will help narrow down the suspects during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know the other Mason card is in the center. I need to gather more information from the others to identify the Werewolves and support the Villagers.
> **Selene:** I am confident that the other Mason card is in the center. This means I am the only Mason here. I want to hear from everyone else, especially if anyone else claims to be the Seer or a Villager.


***Mircea (thoughts as Minion):*** I need to gather more information to see where others stand and to potentially identify any conflicting claims. This will help me devise a strategy to protect Kraven, the werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Alright, everyone. I think it's crucial that we get more information out in the open. Let's hear from others who haven't spoken yet. Vladimir and Marius, what roles are you claiming? And Selene, can you elaborate on why you believe the other Mason card is in the center?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's confidence in the other Mason card being in the center could be crucial information. Understanding her reasoning will help us gauge her credibility and whether she might be hiding something.
> **Vladimir:** I'm curious why you are so confident, Selene. Can you explain how you know the other Mason card is in the center?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to gather more information from Mircea and Vladimir to understand their roles better. Their focus on my certainty could be a tactic to divert attention. By pushing them to reveal their roles, I can better gauge if they are potential Werewolves or not.
> **Selene:** Mircea and Vladimir, you both seem quite interested in why I am confident about the Mason card being in the center. I'm wondering what roles you both are claiming and why you're fixated on my certainty.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I want to subtly cast suspicion on Selene for being so forthright about being the only Mason, while not drawing too much attention to myself. By questioning her motives for sharing that information, it might make others doubt her. At the same time, I'm deflecting by asking Mircea and Vladimir to claim roles, to gather info and keep the target off me. I'm trying to seem like a concerned Villager to avoid suspicion.
> **Kraven:** I'm just a simple Villager, but something about Selene's confidence in being the only Mason seems off to me. If she truly saw the other Mason card in the center, why announce it so openly? It could make her a target. Mircea and Vladimir, I'm also curious what roles you are claiming. We need more information to identify the Werewolves among us.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know that one of the center cards is indeed a Mason, so Selene's claim could be credible. I want to see if her reasoning aligns with my knowledge or if there's any inconsistency in her story.
> **Marius:** Selene, I see you're quite confident about the other Mason card being in the center, which aligns with some of my own findings. Can you clarify how you came to that conclusion?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea has been deflecting attention and pushing for information without revealing anything about their own role. This makes me suspicious and I want to pressure Mircea to provide more information.
> **Selene:** Mircea, you've been asking a lot of questions but haven't shared anything about your own role. What are you claiming to be?


***Mircea (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I can blend in with the innocent roles and maintain suspicion on others. Encouraging Vladimir and Marius to reveal their roles will help me gather more information and potentially create confusion or identify conflicting claims that can be exploited to protect Kraven.
> **Mircea:** Alright, Selene, you seem quite confident about the Mason card being in the center, but I think it's time to clarify our roles to shed more light. I am a simple Villager and have no special powers. Vladimir and Marius, it's crucial to hear your claims now. If we are to identify the Werewolf correctly, we need full transparency from everyone.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea's questioning and lack of revealing his role initially seems suspicious. As a Villager, he should be more forthcoming instead of deflecting and pushing others to speak.
> **Selene:** Mircea, your claim of being a Villager seems very convenient given how much you've been pushing for information without providing much yourself. I'm starting to suspect you might be trying to divert attention away from yourself. Could you explain why you were so interested in my Mason claim if you're just a Villager?


***Mircea (thoughts as Minion):*** By pushing Vladimir and Marius to reveal their roles, I aim to gather more information that could help create confusion or identify conflicting claims. This approach can protect Kraven, the Werewolf, by diverting attention away from him and potentially sowing distrust among the other players.
> **Mircea:** Selene, your confidence about the Mason card being in the center is quite intriguing, but I think it's equally important for everyone to share their roles clearly. Vladimir and Marius, you both have been quite silent about your roles. We need full transparency to identify the Werewolf among us. Could you both please clarify what roles you are claiming? Time is running out, and we need to gather as much information as possible.


***Mircea (thoughts as Minion):*** Directing suspicion towards Kraven can help divert attention away from him since he's actually the Werewolf. If he fumbles or gets too defensive, it might create confusion among other players, making it harder for them to identify the real threat.
> **Mircea:** Kraven, you've been rather quiet and just claimed to be a Villager without much elaboration. Something about that seems a bit too convenient. I'm starting to suspect that you might be hiding something. How can you prove that you're not the Werewolf?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Marius's comment about having findings that align with Selene's claim is suspicious. By directly asking Marius to clarify his role and findings, it puts pressure on him to reveal more information. If he is the Minion or a Werewolf, this direct question may catch him off guard and expose inconsistencies in his story. At the same time, by reiterating my claim as a Villager, I am trying to maintain a low profile and avoid drawing suspicion to myself. Questioning Marius helps shift the focus away from me while potentially uncovering important information about his role and motives.
> **Kraven:** Marius, you mentioned that Selene's confidence about the Mason card aligns with some of your own findings. Can you clarify what you discovered and what role you are claiming? As a simple Villager, I find it concerning that you seem to have additional information but haven't shared it openly.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea has been deflecting attention and asking a lot of questions without sharing much about his own role, which seems suspicious to me. It's important to press him for more information to unearth any inconsistencies.
> **Marius:** Mircea, you're being awfully aggressive with your questioning without providing much information about yourself. Why are you so fixated on Selene and not sharing anything substantial about your own role?


***Mircea (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Vladimir to reveal his role, I can shift some of the focus and suspicion onto him. This can create confusion and make it harder for other players to identify Kraven as the Werewolf. Additionally, it gives me a chance to see if there are any conflicting claims that can be exploited.
> **Mircea:** Vladimir, I notice you've been pretty quiet and haven't clarified your role yet. This silence is making me suspicious. If you're truly on the village team, now is the time to share what you know. What role are you claiming and what have you observed so far?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's aggressive questioning and lack of transparency about his own role are suspicious. By directly addressing him, we can press him to reveal more and potentially catch him in a lie or inconsistent story. This will help us gather crucial information to identify the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone, let's get some clarity here. Mircea has been pushing hard for information without giving much away, and that's making me suspicious. Mircea, why have you been so assertive in questioning Selene's claim, and what exactly are you trying to achieve with your line of questioning?


***Mircea (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Vladimir to reveal his role, I can shift some of the focus and suspicion onto him. This can create confusion and make it harder for other players to identify Kraven as the Werewolf. Additionally, it gives me a chance to see if there are any conflicting claims that can be exploited.
> **Mircea:** Alright, Vladimir, you've been awfully quiet and now you're deflecting by questioning my motives. What exactly is your role, and what have you observed so far? We need transparency if we're going to figure out who the Werewolf is.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's quick skepticism of Selene without much elaboration could either be a genuine Villager's instinct or a Werewolf trying to divert attention. We need to dig deeper into his reasoning to understand his motivations.
> **Vladimir:** Kraven, you mentioned you're a simple Villager, but your confidence in Selene's supposed inconsistency is interesting. Why do you find her so suspicious, and what exactly do you think she's hiding?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Vladimir's sudden accusation of Mircea, after being relatively quiet, seems suspicious. By directly questioning Vladimir's motives and lack of transparency, it puts pressure on him to reveal more about his role and findings. If Vladimir is indeed a Werewolf or the Minion, this direct confrontation may expose inconsistencies in his story or make him appear defensive, which could cast doubt on his innocence. Simultaneously, by shifting the focus to Vladimir, it takes the heat off of me and allows me to maintain my facade as a concerned Villager trying to uncover the truth.
> **Kraven:** Vladimir, your sudden accusation of Mircea seems like a convenient way to shift the focus away from yourself. You've been awfully quiet and haven't shared much about your own role. If you're truly a Villager, why haven't you been more forthcoming with information that could help identify the Werewolves? Your silence and sudden defensive stance are making me suspect that you might be hiding something.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's immediate suspicion of Selene without much elaboration could indicate he is trying to divert attention. Pressing him for more information might either expose inconsistencies in his story or help us understand his true motives.
> **Vladimir:** Kraven, your quick suspicion of Selene and your immediate claim of being a Villager seem a bit too convenient. Can you explain why you were so quick to cast doubt on her and what you think she's hiding? Also, why haven't you provided any additional information about what you've observed?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Marius's earlier comment about having findings that aligned with Selene's claim is highly suspicious, especially since he hasn't elaborated on what those findings are or what role he is claiming. By directly questioning Marius and calling out his vagueness, it puts pressure on him to reveal more information. If he is indeed the Minion or a Werewolf, this direct confrontation may expose inconsistencies in his story or make him appear defensive, which could cast doubt on his innocence. At the same time, by focusing the attention on Marius, it takes the heat off of me and allows me to maintain my facade as a concerned Villager trying to uncover the truth.
> **Kraven:** Marius, you mentioned earlier that Selene's confidence about the Mason card aligned with some of your own findings. However, you've been very vague about what those findings are and what role you're claiming. If you truly have information that could help identify the Werewolves, now is the time to share it. Your evasiveness is making me question your motives and wonder if you're trying to hide something.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's behavior is highly suspicious. He has been probing others aggressively without providing much information about himself. It's crucial to press him for clarity and see if there are inconsistencies in his story, which could reveal him as a Werewolf or Minion trying to protect the Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Mircea, youâ€™ve been asking a lot of questions and deflecting attention without revealing much about your role. Why are you so fixated on Selene and why haven't you shared anything substantial about your role?


***Mircea (thoughts as Minion):*** By pushing Vladimir for more clarity, I can shift suspicion onto him and create confusion among the players. This can help protect Kraven by diverting attention away from him and potentially sowing distrust among the others.
> **Mircea:** Alright, everyone, I've been accused of being too aggressive in my questioning, so let me put my cards on the table. I'm a simple Villager, and my goal is to gather as much information as possible to root out the real Werewolf. Vladimir, youâ€™ve been very evasive and only seem to question others when you're pressed. Why is that? If youâ€™re truly on the village team, itâ€™s time to come clean about your role.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's aggressive questioning and lack of transparency are suspicious. Probing him might reveal inconsistencies or force him to provide more useful information. This will help us gather crucial details to identify the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Alright everyone, it feels like we're going in circles here. Mircea has been really aggressive with his questioning, and it's putting me on edge. If he's truly a Villager, why hasn't he shared more about what he's observed or experienced? Mircea, can you explain why you're so focused on Selene and haven't given us any solid information about your own role?


***Mircea (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing for clear and specific answers, I aim to create confusion and misdirection among the players. This will help protect Kraven by shifting focus and potentially causing conflicting claims, making it harder for others to identify the real threat.
> **Mircea:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Selene has been very confident about the other Mason card being in the center, and Vladimir has been rather evasive with his role. If we truly want to identify the Werewolf, we need to get specific answers now. Vladimir, Marius, you both need to clearly state your roles and what you've observed. We can't afford to beat around the bush any longer.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's quick suspicion of Selene could either be a genuine Villager's instinct or a Werewolf attempting to divert attention. By pressing him for more information, we might expose inconsistencies in his story or understand his true motives better.
> **Vladimir:** Kraven, you've been quick to cast doubt on Selene without providing much information yourself. Why are you so confident in accusing her, and what exactly do you think she's hiding?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Marius's earlier comment about having findings that aligned with Selene's claim is highly suspicious, especially since he hasn't elaborated on what those findings are or what role he is claiming. By directly questioning Marius and calling out his vagueness, it puts pressure on him to reveal more information. If he is indeed the Minion or a Werewolf, this direct confrontation may expose inconsistencies in his story or make him appear defensive, which could cast doubt on his innocence. At the same time, by focusing the attention on Marius, it takes the heat off of me and allows me to maintain my facade as a concerned Villager trying to uncover the truth.
> **Kraven:** Marius, you've been awfully quiet and evasive about your role. Earlier, you mentioned having findings that aligned with Selene's, but you never elaborated on what those findings were. If you truly have information that could help identify the Werewolves, now is the time to share it. Your silence and vague comments are making me question your motives and wonder if you're trying to hide something. As a concerned Villager, I think it's crucial that we all put our cards on the table and work together to root out the real threat.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir's evasiveness and lack of substantial contribution make him highly suspicious. Pressing him for more information might reveal inconsistencies or confirm suspicions.
> **Marius:** Vladimir, youâ€™ve been very quiet, and your only contributions have been deflections and questions directed at others. What exactly is your role and why haven't you shared more concrete information?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's behavior is highly suspicious. Aggressively questioning others while not providing clear information about his own role makes him a prime candidate for being a Werewolf. By pressing him now, we might force him to reveal something inconsistent or catch him in a lie, which will be crucial to identifying the real threat.
> **Vladimir:** Mircea, you've been aggressively questioning everyone without revealing much about your own insights. Why are you so focused on Selene and not sharing any substantial information about your role?


***Mircea (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Selene for more details, I aim to cast doubt on her confidence and potentially create confusion among the other players. This will help protect Kraven by diverting attention away from him and making it harder for others to identify the real threat.
> **Mircea:** Selene, you've been very assertive about the Mason card being in the center, and you've questioned my motives quite a bit. However, you've yet to explain how you came to that conclusion. Could you please clarify how you know the other Mason card is in the center? This information is critical for us to move forward.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea's behavior is consistent with someone who is trying to deflect attention and gather information without providing much in return. His claim of being a Villager seems very convenient, and his aggressive questioning could be a tactic to divert suspicion away from himself. By targeting Mircea, we might put pressure on him to reveal more or potentially expose inconsistencies in his statements.
> **Selene:** Mircea, your aggressive questioning and lack of initial transparency make me highly suspicious. I think you might be the Werewolf. Why were you so focused on gathering information from others without revealing much about yourself?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Mircea has been the most aggressive in questioning others without initially revealing his own role. His behavior is consistent with someone trying to deflect suspicion away from themselves. This, combined with his convenience in claiming to be a Villager only after being pressured, makes him the most likely candidate for a Werewolf. Voting for Mircea seems like the best move to potentially eliminate a Werewolf and win the game for the village team.
> **Selene [Mason]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Mircea (thoughts as Minion):*** Given the aggressive questioning and lack of transparency about my own role, it's likely that suspicion has fallen on me. By voting for myself, I align with the Minion's goal to protect the Werewolf and increase the chances that someone other than Kraven, the real Werewolf, gets voted out. This move aims to create confusion and protect Kraven.
> **Mircea [Minion]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's aggressive questioning without providing much information about his own role makes him highly suspicious. His behavior is consistent with someone trying to divert attention away from themselves, which is a common strategy for a Werewolf. By voting for Mircea, we have a higher chance of identifying and eliminating the Werewolf, which is crucial for the village team's victory.
> **Vladimir [Villager]:** I am voting for Mircea.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Based on the discussions, Marius seems to be the most suspicious player. He claimed to have findings that aligned with Selene's about the Mason card being in the center, but never elaborated on what those findings were or what his role is. When pressed for more information, he remained evasive and tried to deflect attention onto others, particularly Mircea and Vladimir. This behavior suggests that Marius might be hiding something, possibly being the Minion or a Werewolf trying to avoid detection. By voting for Marius, I aim to eliminate a potential threat while also aligning my vote with what I believe the other villagers might do based on the suspicions raised against him. If Marius turns out to be a Werewolf or the Minion, this vote could help secure a victory for the village team.
> **Kraven [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Marius (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea has been very aggressive in questioning others without providing much information about his own role. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with what one might expect from a Werewolf or their Minion. Given the information that I, as the Seer, have confirmed one of the center cards to be a Mason, Selene's claim appears credible. Mircea's actions seem more like those of someone trying to deflect attention away from themselves or their allies. Thus, I believe Mircea is the best candidate for a Werewolf.
> **Marius [Seer]:** I am voting for Mircea.


The votes were:
* Mircea : Minion : 4
* Marius : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Mircea was killed. The werewolves win.
