## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Selene. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Ileana and Alexia. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Larisa. They are thinking about their action.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give me more information about which roles are in play and which are not. This can help narrow down the possibilities for everyone's roles during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By encouraging everyone to share their information early on, we can start piecing together the clues and identifying inconsistencies in people's stories. This will help us identify the Werewolves more efficiently.
> **Larisa:** I just want to get things started by saying that I think it's important to figure out who the Werewolves are as quickly as possible. Does anyone have any information they'd like to share about their role or what they saw during the night?


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing that I am a Mason and confirming Alexia as the other Mason, I am establishing a base of trust. This helps to identify that both of us are not Werewolves, thus narrowing down the suspects. Now we need to focus on identifying who among Larisa, Selene, and Kraven might be the Werewolves or Minion.
> **Ileana:** I think it’s important to get things moving. I can confirm that I am a Mason and I saw Alexia is the other Mason. This means we are both on the village team, and you can trust us.


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to gather more information to identify the Werewolves. Since Ileana and I are confirmed Masons, it's important to see what roles the others claim. Starting with Larisa will help us start piecing things together.
> **Alexia:** Ileana and I are both Masons, so we are definitely on the village team. Since we have two confirmed Masons, let's hear from others. Larisa, what role do you claim to have?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** We should gather more information from other players to see if anyone's story conflicts with what Ileana and Alexia have said. This will help us narrow down the possibilities and potentially identify the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** That’s interesting, Ileana and Alexia. I’m curious to hear from Kraven next. What role do you claim to have, Kraven?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** I need to gather more information and Selene hasn't spoken yet. It's important to get everyone involved to identify potential Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Alright, Larisa, since you asked, I'll say that I am a Villager. I don't have any special information, but I believe we need to figure out more about the other roles present. Let's hear from Selene next. What role do you claim to have?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By claiming to be the Seer and saying I saw a Werewolf card in the center, I can make the others believe there is still a hidden Werewolf while sounding like I'm trying to help the village team. Accusing Larisa puts the focus on her and pressures her to reveal her role. This concealment of my true role and misdirection towards Larisa should help keep me from being discovered as the Werewolf for now.
> **Selene:** Well, since you're asking, I'm actually the Seer. Last night I looked at two of the center cards and saw a Werewolf and a Villager. So there's definitely at least one Werewolf still out there among us. Larisa, you've been asking a lot of questions but haven't claimed a role yourself. What exactly are you? Because I'm starting to get suspicious...


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to confront Selene directly because her claim contradicts my knowledge. By exposing this discrepancy, I can either catch her in a lie or force her to clarify her statement, helping us identify the real Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Selene, I find it really suspicious that you claim to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center cards. Because I actually saw two Villagers in the center. So, either you're lying, or something strange has happened here.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa is directly contradicting my claim about seeing a Werewolf card in the center. By forcefully accusing her of lying and suggesting she is the Minion, I can discredit her and make the others doubt anything else she says. This puts her on the defensive and draws the attention away from me. If I can get the others to suspect she is the Minion protecting a Werewolf, they may vote to eliminate her, which would be great for me as the actual Werewolf
> **Selene:** Larisa, you're claiming you saw two Villagers in the center, but I know for a fact that's not true. I looked at one of the center cards myself and it was the other Werewolf card. So either you're mistaken or you're deliberately trying to mislead us. I think you're the Minion and you're trying to protect your Werewolf partner! Everyone, we need to be very suspicious of Larisa's claims.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By pointing out the contradiction in Selene's statement and appealing to the trustworthiness of the Masons, I aim to gather support from the confirmed village team members. If Selene is lying, she is either a Minion or a Werewolf, and exposing her will help us in identifying the true roles.
> **Larisa:** Ileana, Alexia, if you are both Masons as you claim, then you are on the village team. Given what I have seen in the center, I think Selene might be lying about being the Seer. Why would she make a false claim about the center cards unless she has something to hide? I believe she might be the Minion or a Werewolf.


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** There is a direct conflict between Selene and Larisa's claims about the center cards. As a confirmed Mason, it's my duty to help clarify this discrepancy and determine who might be lying, which could indicate a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Ileana:** Selene, you're claiming to be the Seer and saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center, but Larisa is contradicting you by saying she saw two Villagers in the center. This is a major discrepancy that we need to address. We can't both be right, and it's crucial we find out who is lying. Selene, if you're really the Seer, can you explain why Larisa would make such a contradictory claim?


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana raised a valid question about the discrepancy between my Seer claim and what Larisa said she saw. I need to firmly reinforce that I am the real Seer and that Larisa is the one lying. By pointing out that it wouldn't make sense for a Werewolf to falsely claim Seer, I can argue that I have no motive to lie, while Larisa does have motive if she's the Minion. Shifting the focus onto Larisa's potential Minion role and her reasons for lying keeps the heat off of me. I'm appealing to Ileana's logic to get her to doubt Larisa and believe my Seer claim instead.
> **Selene:** Ileana, I understand your concern, but I can assure you that I am telling the truth. I am the real Seer and I did see a Werewolf card in the center. Larisa is the one who is lying and contradicting me. Think about it - what motive would I have to falsely claim to be the Seer? The Seer is on the village team, so if I was actually a Werewolf or Minion, it would make no sense for me to claim a role that goes against my own team. The only reason Larisa would lie about what she saw is if she's trying to protect the Werewolves. She's clearly the Minion trying to sow confusion and doubt to keep her Werewolf ally safe. Don't fall for her tricks!


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Kraven claims to be a Villager, his perspective might help us determine who is lying between Selene and Larisa. This is crucial because it will help us identify the Minion or Werewolf and make an informed decision when it comes time to vote.
> **Ileana:** Given the conflicting information between Selene and Larisa, I think it's crucial that we get more clarity from Kraven. Kraven, you mentioned you are a Villager and don't have any special information, but we need your input on this matter. Who do you believe is more trustworthy: Selene or Larisa?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** We have two conflicting claims about the center cards. It's crucial to clarify this discrepancy because it can help us identify who is lying. Larisa's explanation will help us decide if she is trustworthy or if she's trying to mislead us.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, you have been very vocal and asked a lot of questions, but your claims about the center cards directly contradict Selene's. It's time for you to explain why we should believe you over Selene. What exactly did you see in the center?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven needs to understand the significance of the discrepancy between my statement and Selene's. By highlighting this contradiction, I aim to gain the trust of the Masons and the Villagers and expose Selene's potential deceit.
> **Larisa:** Kraven, I understand your skepticism, but I want to make it absolutely clear. When I looked at the center cards, I saw two Villagers. This directly contradicts Selene’s claim of seeing a Werewolf and a Villager in the center. Given this major discrepancy, I believe Selene is trying to sow confusion and protect the Werewolves. Masons, Ileana and Alexia, think carefully about this. We cannot afford to let a Werewolf or Minion deceive us.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** We have conflicting statements about the center cards. If Larisa is lying, she might be the Minion or a Werewolf trying to mislead us. We need to put pressure on her to reveal more and clarify this situation.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, your claims about the center cards are making me very suspicious. If you saw two Villagers, then why would Selene claim to have seen a Werewolf? This discrepancy needs to be resolved.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By focusing on the contradiction between Selene's claim and mine, I aim to expose her potential deceit and protect the village team. If Selene is lying, she is likely a threat, and we need to eliminate her to win the game.
> **Larisa:** Everyone, we need to seriously consider the discrepancy between my statement and Selene's. I am confident in what I saw in the center: two Villager cards. Selene's claim of seeing a Werewolf and a Villager does not align with this. I strongly believe Selene is lying and could be a Werewolf or a Minion trying to protect the Werewolves.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to appeal directly to Alexia as a confirmed Mason and village team member. By pointing out how illogical it would be for me to falsely claim Seer, I can argue that Larisa is the one lying and that her suspicious behavior pegs her as the Minion. Alexia's support as a trusted player would be crucial in getting the others to believe me over Larisa. I have to emphasize that Larisa's contradictory claims make her untrustworthy and that I am the one telling the truth as the real Seer. Directing this to Alexia puts her in the position of having to pick a side, and I'm hoping my argument is persuasive enough to get her to side with me against Larisa.
> **Selene:** Alexia, as a confirmed Mason, your insight is invaluable here. Larisa's claims about the center cards are highly suspicious and contradict what I know I saw. If she's telling the truth, then why would I falsely claim to be the Seer and risk being caught in a lie? It makes no sense. The only logical explanation is that Larisa is lying to protect the Werewolves. She must be the Minion trying to create doubt and confusion. Alexia, you need to trust me on this. Larisa cannot be believed!


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Given that Ileana and I are confirmed Masons, and Selene's claim of being the Seer seems more consistent with the roles in play, Larisa's contradictory statements make her the most suspicious. If Selene was indeed the Seer and saw a Werewolf, it means we need to consider the possibility that Larisa is trying to protect a Werewolf or is the Minion herself.
> **Alexia:** Everyone, considering all the information we've gathered, I think it's pretty clear. Larisa's story just doesn't add up. Selene, if you really saw a Werewolf and a Villager in the center, that makes more sense given the odds and the roles we know are in play. Larisa, on the other hand, keeps insisting she saw two Villagers which seems like an attempt to mislead us.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** The discrepancy between Larisa's and Selene's statements is crucial. If Larisa is lying, she's likely a Minion or a Werewolf. We need to pressure her to reveal more information or catch her in a contradiction.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, your claims about seeing two Villagers in the center are highly suspicious. Selene's account seems more consistent with what we've discussed. Explain to us why we should believe you over Selene.


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By questioning Kraven's logic and focusing on the risks of Selene's bold claim, I aim to highlight the implausibility of her story and shift suspicion onto her. This will help to gather support from other players and expose Selene's potential deception.
> **Larisa:** Kraven, I understand your skepticism, but let me ask you this: If Selene truly saw a Werewolf in the center, why would she make such a bold claim knowing it could easily be contradicted by another Seer? This seems like a reckless move for a real Seer, don't you think?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's claim seems more consistent with the roles in play. Larisa's contradiction makes her highly suspicious, potentially the Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Kraven:** Larisa, your insistence on seeing two Villagers in the center is really suspicious to me. If Selene is indeed the Seer and saw a Werewolf and a Villager, it aligns more with the odds and roles we know are in play. Why would you risk making such a bold claim if it could easily be contradicted? This makes me think you might be the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves. Everyone, we need to seriously consider targeting Larisa for elimination.

> **Larisa:** Kraven, I understand your concern, but let me ask you this: If Selene truly saw a Werewolf in the center, why would she make such a bold claim knowing it could easily be contradicted by another Seer? This seems like a reckless move for a real Seer, don't you think?


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Given the conflicting information, it's critical to pressure Larisa to explain her position. This will help us determine if she's lying and potentially the Minion or a Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Selene, your claim about seeing a Werewolf and a Villager in the center makes sense given the roles in this game. But Larisa's insistence on seeing two Villagers feels off to me. Larisa, why would you make such a bold claim that directly contradicts the Seer unless you had something to hide?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By directly addressing the contradiction and reinforcing my knowledge as the real Seer, I aim to highlight Selene's deception and gather support from the confirmed Masons and Villagers. This will help us target the real threat and ensure a victory for the village team.
> **Larisa:** Everyone, we need to focus on the clear contradiction here. Selene's claim of being the Seer and seeing a Werewolf in the center is extremely suspicious. As the real Seer, I can tell you that there were only Villagers in the center. Selene must be the Minion or a Werewolf trying to deceive us. Let's not fall for her tricks. I urge all of you to consider this seriously.

I urge all of you to consider this seriously.


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** The major discrepancy between Larisa and Selene's statements needs to be addressed. If Larisa is lying, she could be the Minion or a Werewolf attempting to protect her teammates. It's critical to challenge her and uncover her true intentions.
> **Ileana:** Larisa, your claim about seeing two Villagers in the center is highly suspicious to me. Selene's account seems more consistent with the roles we know are in play. Why would you make such a bold claim that directly contradicts what the Seer might see unless you had something to hide?


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By appealing to Alexia's role as a confirmed Mason, I aim to gather support from the most trustworthy players on the village team. Highlighting the risk of Selene's bold claim will help us focus on the real threat and ensure we eliminate the Werewolves or Minion.
> **Larisa:** Alexia, as a confirmed Mason, you need to consider the risk of Selene's bold claim. Why would she make such a claim that could easily be contradicted unless she's trying to mislead us? She's either the Minion or a Werewolf. We need to focus on this clear contradiction.


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's account of seeing a Werewolf in the center seems more plausible, especially since it aligns with the odds and the roles we know. Larisa's contradictory claims about seeing two Villagers raises major red flags and suggests she's trying to protect the Werewolves.
> **Alexia:** Larisa, your insistence on seeing two Villagers in the center just doesn't add up. Given Selene's consistent claims and the roles in play, I have strong reasons to believe you are either the Minion or a Werewolf. I'm publicly accusing you of trying to mislead us.

***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** We need clarity on Kraven's stance. His input could help us determine who is lying between Selene and Larisa.
> **Alexia:** Kraven, you've heard Selene and Larisa both claim to have seen different things in the center. Who do you believe and why?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** As the real Seer, I know that there are two Villagers in the center, which contradicts Selene's claim of seeing a Werewolf and a Villager. Given this major discrepancy, I believe Selene is lying and could be the Minion or a Werewolf trying to mislead us. By voting for Selene, we can eliminate a potential threat and ensure a higher chance of the village team's victory.
> **Larisa [Seer]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** There is a direct contradiction between Selene and Larisa's claims about the center cards. As a confirmed Mason, I trust Selene's account more because it aligns better with the odds and roles in play. Larisa's insistence on seeing two Villagers in the center seems like a deliberate attempt to mislead us, indicating that she might be the Minion or a Werewolf.
> **Ileana [Mason]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Alexia (thoughts as Mason):*** Given the conflicting claims between Selene and Larisa, Selene's account of seeing a Werewolf and a Villager in the center aligns more with the probabilities and roles in play. Larisa's contradictory claim of seeing two Villagers seems like an attempt to mislead us. Given that Ileana and I are confirmed Masons, it is likely that Larisa is the Minion or a Werewolf trying to protect her ally. Voting for Larisa gives us the best chance to eliminate the threat to the village team.
> **Alexia [Mason]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Selene (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Based on the discussions during the day phase, I believe voting for Larisa is the best play. She has been the most vocal in contradicting my claim of being the Seer and seeing a Werewolf card in the center. By forcefully accusing her of lying and suggesting she is the Minion trying to protect a hidden Werewolf, I was able to discredit her and make the others doubt her claims. Alexia, as a confirmed Mason and trusted player, seemed to believe my arguments over Larisa's and publicly accused her of being the Minion or a Werewolf. Kraven also expressed strong suspicion of Larisa's claims. By directing the conversation to focus on Larisa's contradictions and shady behavior, I was able to deflect attention away from myself as the actual Werewolf. I think I've built enough doubt around Larisa that the others are likely to vote for her. So to increase the chances of her being eliminated instead of me, I should add my vote for Larisa as well.
> **Selene [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Kraven (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's claim of seeing two Villagers in the center directly contradicts Selene's claim of seeing a Werewolf and a Villager. Given that Selene's account seems more consistent with the roles in play and Larisa's repeated insistence on her claim without providing additional convincing evidence, I suspect Larisa is either the Minion or a Werewolf trying to mislead us. Therefore, I believe targeting Larisa for elimination is the best course of action to increase our chances of winning.
> **Kraven [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


The votes were:
* Larisa : Seer : 4
* Selene : Werewolf : 1



>***GAME:*** Larisa was killed. The werewolves win.
