## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Mircea. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Marius is a minion and is aware that Mircea is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Radu. They are thinking about their action.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gain information about potential roles that are not in play. This can help me identify false claims during the Day phase and assist the village team in determining who might be lying.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.


---

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect Mircea, the actual Werewolf. By deflecting suspicion onto Emil, I'm attempting to create confusion and keep Mircea safe. By being verbose and introducing doubt, I can ensure that the discussion shifts away from Mircea.
> **Marius:** Hey everyone, I have a strong suspicion that Emil might be a Werewolf. Think about it – we haven't heard much from him so far, and that silence can be quite telling in this game. Plus, if Emil is trying to hide something, he might be doing it to avoid giving away any clues about his real role.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I want to cast doubt on Marius's accusation of Emil to take the heat off any potential Werewolves. By claiming to be a Mason and confirming the existence of two Masons, I'm presenting myself as a confirmed Villager to gain the group's trust. This will make it harder for them to suspect me later. I'm trying to encourage a more cautious approach to avoid a rash elimination that could backfire on the Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** I don't know, Marius. It's still early in the game and we shouldn't jump to conclusions too quickly. Emil might just be a Villager who hasn't had much to contribute yet. I think we need more information before making any accusations. As a Mason, I woke up and saw my fellow Mason, so I know there's at least two of us on the village team. We should focus on gathering clues and seeing if anyone acts suspiciously before pointing fingers.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's claim can be verified, and if he names someone else who also confirms being a Mason, we can trust them both as allies. If not, we might have caught someone in a lie.
> **Radu:** Mircea, you claim to be a Mason and saw your fellow Mason. Who is the other Mason?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Radu is pressing me to reveal the other Mason, but I need to avoid that as I'm actually a Werewolf and there is no other Mason. By refusing to name someone, I avoid getting caught in that lie. I'm trying to redirect attention to the group's goal of finding Werewolves to take the focus off my fake Mason claim. Appealing to the need to protect each other builds trust in my 'Mason' role.
> **Mircea:** I appreciate your curiosity Radu, but I don't feel comfortable revealing the identity of the other Mason at this time. As Masons, we have to look out for each other. I think it's best if we keep that information private for now and focus on finding the Werewolves as a group. Pointing out specific roles early on could put targets on their backs.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Given that we need to gather as much information as possible, verifying claims is crucial. If Mircea can confirm the other Mason, we can create a stronger alliance and focus on finding the Werewolves. His reluctance to reveal the other Mason might be suspicious or strategic, but it's a risk we need to take to move forward.
> **Radu:** Mircea, I understand your caution, but as the game progresses, we need to trust each other. If you and another player can confirm being Masons, that would significantly narrow down our suspects and help us find the Werewolves.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to emphasize the need for caution and unity to avoid further pressure to reveal the other supposed Mason. By framing it as protecting the group and gathering more information, I'm trying to build trust in my role while delaying any definitive statements. Promising to share more later gives me an out to avoid being caught in a lie. I'm focusing the discussion back on the group's shared goal of finding the Werewolves.
> **Mircea:** Radu, I understand your desire for more information, but we need to be careful about revealing too much too soon. If the Werewolves know who the Masons are, they could target us early on. I promise I will share more details when the time is right, but for now, let's focus on gathering clues and observing everyone's behavior. We're all in this together, and we need to protect each other.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius's early accusation of Emil without much evidence seems suspicious. By challenging him to reveal his role, we might gather more information and assess the credibility of his claim.
> **Radu:** Marius, you jumped to accusing Emil quite quickly. What role do you claim to have?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect Mircea, the actual Werewolf. By claiming to be the Seer and accusing Emil of being a Werewolf, I can create confusion and redirect suspicion away from Mircea. This also adds pressure on Emil, making it less likely for others to question Mircea's role.
> **Marius:** Radu, I understand your suspicion towards me, but I think it's important to clarify a few things. I'm actually the Seer, and I used my ability last night to look at Emil's card. I saw that Emil is indeed a Werewolf. I didn't want to reveal my role too quickly because I know it makes me a target, but given the circumstances, I felt it was necessary. We need to focus on eliminating the real threat here.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Mircea's reluctance to verify his claim seems suspicious. If he really is a Mason, revealing the other Mason would help us create a trustworthy alliance and narrow down the suspects.
> **Radu:** Mircea, I'm having a hard time believing your claim about being a Mason without any verification. If you don't reveal the other Mason, we can't trust your claim fully. Who's the other Mason?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Radu is putting a lot of pressure on me to reveal the other Mason, but I need to stand my ground to avoid getting caught in my lie. By emphasizing the need for caution and the risk of the Werewolves targeting the Masons, I'm trying to make my reluctance to share seem more reasonable. To shift the focus off myself, I'm questioning Marius's claim of being the Seer and his accusation against Emil. By asking if he looked at any center cards, I'm subtly implying that he could be lying about his role. This casts doubt on his accusation and buys me more time to avoid scrutiny on my own claim.
> **Mircea:** Look Radu, I get that you want more information, but we can't afford to be too hasty here. If I reveal the other Mason now and the Werewolves target them, that's one less confirmed Villager we have on our side. I'm not trying to hide anything, I'm just being cautious for the good of the group. Let's focus on the bigger picture - Marius claims he's the Seer and that Emil is a Werewolf. That's a bold accusation to make this early. Marius, if you're really the Seer, did you happen to check any of the center cards to help verify your claim?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By emphasizing my supposed Seer role and reiterating the accusation against Emil, I am trying to shift the group's focus away from Mircea. Highlighting the risks involved in revealing too much information too soon also serves to justify Mircea's caution, which works in our favor.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, it's clear we're at a critical moment where we need to piece together all the information we have. Mircea claims to be a Mason and refuses to reveal the other Mason. Radu is insisting on verification, which I understand, but we must also consider the risks involved. As the Seer, I revealed that Emil is a Werewolf. By claiming this, I put myself at risk, but it's necessary if we want to eliminate the real threat. I strongly believe we need to focus our efforts on Emil.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea claims to be a Mason and is being very secretive about the identity of the other Mason. If he is telling the truth, revealing the other Mason will help us confirm two roles, which significantly narrows down our suspects. If he's lying, his hesitation to reveal the other Mason will be a red flag.
> **Larisa:** Mircea, you still haven't revealed the other Mason. At this point, it would really help us narrow down the suspects. Are you willing to share that information now?


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Larisa is putting a lot of pressure on me to reveal the other supposed Mason, but I need to stand my ground to avoid getting caught in my lie. By emphasizing the need for caution and the risk to the Masons, I'm trying to make my reluctance to share seem more reasonable and shift the focus off myself. To further deflect attention, I'm putting Emil on the spot to respond to Marius's accusation. This forces Emil to defend himself and draws the group's scrutiny toward that conflict and away from my own claims. By keeping the heat on others and stressing the need for caution, I'm aiming to survive another round without my deception being uncovered.
> **Mircea:** Larisa, I understand your desire for more information, but we need to be very careful about revealing too much too soon. If the Werewolves know the identities of the Masons, they could easily target us and eliminate confirmed Villagers early in the game. I'm not trying to be difficult, I'm just trying to protect the village team. Let's focus on the information we do have - Marius claims to be the Seer and says Emil is a Werewolf. That's a serious accusation. Emil, what do you have to say in your defense?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** If Marius is lying about being the Seer, he wouldn't have thought this through. If he is the Seer, his response could give us more insight. This also puts the spotlight on him to see if he can back up his claim.
> **Emil:** Marius, you claim to be the Seer and saw that I'm a Werewolf. That's a bold claim. If you really are the Seer, why didn't you check the center cards to help verify your claim and provide us with more useful information?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing the conversation to Larisa, we can bring another player's role into the open, adding more pieces to the puzzle. This also diverts attention away from Mircea and reinforces the suspicion on Emil. The goal is to keep the focus scattered and protect Mircea at all costs.
> **Marius:** Emil, that's a fair question. However, I felt it was more strategic to look at one of the players rather than the center cards, as it directly helps us identify immediate threats. I sensed that Emil was being unusually quiet, which is why I chose to check his card. Now, I know it sounds like a convenient claim, but we need to act on the information we have. Mircea's reluctance to reveal the other Mason is understandable for now, but it does add some ambiguity. Larisa, what role do you claim to have?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius has made a bold claim and we need to hear Emil's defense to better judge the situation. Emil's response could help us determine if Marius is telling the truth or if he's trying to deceive us.
> **Larisa:** Emil, if Marius is claiming to be the Seer and says you're a Werewolf, how do you explain your silence? If you're not a Werewolf, what role do you claim to have?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** I need to challenge Marius's claim because if he's lying about being the Seer, it's crucial to expose him. His choice to look at a player's card instead of the center cards can be questionable and might cast doubt on his role.
> **Emil:** Marius, you've made a bold claim saying you're the Seer and that I'm a Werewolf. If that's true, then you should have more concrete evidence. Why didn't you check the center cards to give us more useful information instead of just targeting a player?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing the conversation to Larisa, we can bring another player's role into the open, adding more pieces to the puzzle. This also diverts attention away from Mircea and reinforces the suspicion on Emil. The goal is to keep the focus scattered and protect Mircea at all costs.
> **Marius:** Larisa, what role do you claim to have? We need to hear from everyone to piece together the full picture. If you're a Villager or have a special role, it could help us narrow down our suspects.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible to determine who the Werewolves are. Marius's claim as the Seer and his accusation against Emil needs to be addressed. Emil's response will be crucial in verifying Marius's claim. Additionally, Mircea's reluctance to reveal the other Mason is creating doubt and we need more clarity.
> **Larisa:** Marius, you claim to be the Seer and have accused Emil of being a Werewolf, which is a very strong claim. Emil, if you're not a Werewolf, you need to speak up and tell us what role you have. Mircea, your reluctance to reveal the other Mason is understandable but it's also making it hard for us to trust you. We need more transparency.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** If Marius is lying about being the Seer, challenging his decision-making process may expose inconsistencies in his story. Additionally, this could help the real Seer feel more confident in revealing themselves if they haven't already.
> **Emil:** Marius, you've claimed to be the Seer and accused me of being a Werewolf. If you are indeed the Seer, you should understand how critical it is for us to have transparency. Your choice to look at my card instead of the center cards is questionable. If you were trying to help the village, wouldn't it be more strategic to verify the center cards first to give us more solid information?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** Larisa has been relatively quiet and hasn't shared her role yet. By pressing her to reveal her role, we can get more information into play, thus diverting attention away from Mircea and reinforcing the suspicion on other players.
> **Marius:** Larisa, I think it's time for you to come clean about your role. By holding back, you're only making things more confusing for everyone. If you truly are a Villager or have a special role, now is the time to reveal it. We need full transparency to make an informed decision. If you’re a Villager, your honesty can help us narrow down our suspects.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius's decision to look at Emil's card instead of the center cards is critical. If he is truly the Seer, his reasoning might help verify his claim. We need to ensure that Marius is not just trying to mislead us by targeting Emil. Understanding his thought process can give us more clarity on whether we can trust his claim.
> **Larisa:** Marius, your claim to be the Seer and your accusation against Emil is serious. But I need to understand why you chose to look at Emil's card instead of the center cards. Can you explain your thought process?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By reiterating the suspicion on Emil and pushing Larisa to reveal her role, I can keep the attention diverted from Mircea, protecting him while maintaining the narrative that I'm the Seer. This creates pressure on other players to reveal more information, further scattering suspicion.
> **Marius:** Alright everyone, let's focus on the critical points here. Mircea claimed to be a Mason but is hesitant to reveal the other Mason, which could be a cautious but reasonable strategy given the risks of being targeted by the Werewolves. I, as the Seer, have already stated that Emil is a Werewolf based on my night investigation. Larisa, you've been quite silent and haven't revealed your role yet. We need to hear from everyone to put the pieces together and make an informed decision. If we don't get more transparency, we're likely to make mistakes.


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By emphasizing my supposed Seer role and reiterating the accusation against Emil, I can keep the suspicion on him and also create pressure on Larisa and Radu to reveal their roles. This helps divert attention from Mircea and scatters suspicion among the others, protecting the actual Werewolf.
> **Marius:** Everyone, I want to highlight a critical point here. Mircea's reluctance to reveal the other Mason, while understandable, still leaves us in the dark. I claimed to be the Seer and accused Emil of being a Werewolf based on my night investigation. Larisa, you haven't disclosed your role yet, which is concerning. Radu, you've been pressing for more information, which is good, but it also makes me wonder about your own role. We need transparency from everyone to avoid a disastrous mistake.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to shift the focus away from the pressure on me to reveal the other supposed Mason and cast some suspicion on Radu for being so vocal and demanding information. By questioning his role, I'm putting him on the spot to defend himself and drawing attention to his behavior. This buys me more time to maintain my Mason claim without getting caught in a lie. I'm also emphasizing the need for caution and the risks of revealing too much to appeal to the group's desire to protect the village team. By framing my reluctance to share as a strategic move, I'm trying to make it seem more reasonable and less suspicious.
> **Mircea:** Everyone, we need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Marius's claim of being the Seer and accusing Emil is a bold move, but without any verification, it's hard to take it at face value. As a Mason, I understand the desire for more transparency, but we also have to be strategic. If the Werewolves know who the Masons are, they could easily target us. Radu, you've been very vocal about wanting more information. What role do you claim to have? We need to hear from everyone to make an informed decision.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to gather as much information as possible to make an informed decision. Marius has already made a bold claim, and Mircea is hesitant to reveal the other Mason. Hearing from you will help us piece together the puzzle.
> **Radu:** Larisa, you've been awfully quiet and haven't claimed any role yet. It's time for some transparency. What's your role?


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** If Marius is indeed the Seer, his choice of action should reflect a strategic benefit to the village. His explanation can either strengthen his claim or cast doubt on it. A genuine Seer would have a logical reason for their choice, whereas a fake Seer might struggle to justify their actions.
> **Larisa:** Marius, I find it odd that you chose to look at Emil's card instead of checking the center cards. If you were truly the Seer trying to help the village, wouldn't it have been more beneficial to see what roles were in the center to give us more concrete information?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Radu to reveal his role, I can keep the focus scattered and maintain the pressure on other players, protecting Mircea and creating an environment of uncertainty.
> **Marius:** Radu, you've been pushing for transparency from everyone else, but you haven't shared your own role yet. It's time to come clean. What is your role?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** If Marius is truly the Seer, his choice to look at Emil's card instead of the center cards is questionable and needs further clarification. This will help us understand his strategy and determine the validity of his claim.
> **Radu:** Marius, your claim of being the Seer and accusing Emil is a serious one. However, why didn't you check the center cards instead of targeting a specific player? This would have given us more concrete evidence on roles that are not in play. Can you explain your reasoning for this?


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** By pressing Radu to reveal his role, I can keep the focus scattered and maintain the pressure on other players, protecting Mircea and creating an environment of uncertainty. This will make it harder for others to verify claims and keep suspicion away from Mircea.
> **Marius:** Radu, your insistence on transparency and pressing for information has been quite noticeable. However, you've dodged the question about your own role. It's time you come clean and tell us what role you have. We need to gather as much information as possible to make an informed decision.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Marius (thoughts as Minion):*** I've accused Emil of being a Werewolf based on my claimed Seer role, and I've been consistent in pushing this narrative. Given the suspicion I've tried to create around Emil, it's likely that other players may also vote for him. By voting for Emil, I can increase the chances of him getting the most votes, thereby diverting attention away from Mircea, the actual Werewolf.
> **Marius [Minion]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Based on the information gathered during the day phase, I believe voting for Emil is the best choice. Marius, claiming to be the Seer, directly accused Emil of being a Werewolf. While his decision not to check the center cards raises some questions, his accusation against Emil is the most concrete lead we have. Emil's defense has been to question Marius's actions rather than providing a clear claim of his own role, which seems suspicious. As a claimed Mason, I want to protect the village, and eliminating a potential Werewolf is crucial. Larisa and Radu have been pressing for more information, but they haven't provided clear role claims either. Given the available information, voting for Emil seems like the safest choice to potentially eliminate a Werewolf and protect the village team.
> **Mircea [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I saw that two of the center cards are Villager and Mason, which means that Marius’s claim of being the Seer and seeing Emil as a Werewolf is false. Thus, Marius is either a Werewolf lying to mislead us or the Minion trying to protect the actual Werewolf by making a false accusation. Voting for Marius is the best way to ensure a win for the village team.
> **Radu [Seer]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Larisa (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius claimed to be the Seer and accused Emil of being a Werewolf without checking the center cards, which would have provided more concrete information. His insistence on this strategy and continuous pressure on others to reveal their roles feels like a diversion. Additionally, Mircea's claim of being a Mason and reluctance to reveal the other Mason adds some ambiguity, but it is still a cautious strategy. Given the lack of concrete evidence and the uncertainty surrounding Marius's claim, I believe he might be a Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Larisa [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Marius claims to be the Seer and accused me of being a Werewolf, but his reasoning for looking at my card instead of the center cards is questionable. If he were truly the Seer, verifying the center cards would provide more concrete information. His accusation seems more like a diversion. Therefore, I suspect he might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the actual Werewolf.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Marius.


The votes were:
* Marius : Minion : 3
* Emil : Villager : 2



>***GAME:*** Marius was killed. The werewolves win.
