## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Lucian. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Kraven. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dracula. They are thinking about their action.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will help me gather more information about the distribution of roles. If I find any Werewolf or Minion cards in the center, I can safely declare that those roles are not in play among the players, which will be valuable information during the Day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf trying to hide my identity, I need to cast suspicion on someone else to take the heat off me. Dracula has been laying low, which could be a sign he's a Werewolf trying not to draw attention. By directly accusing him and putting him on the spot, I'm hoping to make him look guilty and get the other players wondering about him instead of me. This exaggeration and untruth about his behavior should sow seeds of doubt.
> **Lucian:** I have a strong suspicion that Dracula might be a Werewolf. He's been unusually quiet and seems to be avoiding eye contact with everyone. What do you have to say for yourself, Dracula?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to defend myself and provide the group with useful information. By questioning Lucian directly, I can put some pressure on him to reveal his role or trip up if he is lying.
> **Dracula:** Lucian, I can assure you that I'm not a Werewolf. In fact, I have some valuable information. I checked the center cards last night and saw a Villager and a Mason there. This means at least one of the Villager or Mason claims among us must be true. I'm curious to know what role you are claiming, Lucian.


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's claim about the center cards seems dubious. If he really saw a Villager and Mason, he should have shared that information immediately to help the Village team. The fact that he waited until he was accused to reveal it makes it seem like he may have made it up as a defense. By questioning the timing of his reveal, I can cast doubt on his honesty without making any definitive accusations that could backfire on me. \n\nI'm also claiming to be a Villager to seem non-threatening, since Villager is the most common role. Directing a question at Viktor puts him on the spot and shifts attention away from me and Dracula. Viktor has been flying under the radar, so calling him out should make people look at him as a potential Werewolf. The goal is to muddy the waters, keep the Village team confused and arguing, and hope a Villager gets falsely accused.
> **Lucian:** Dracula, your claim about seeing a Villager and Mason in the center is very interesting. But I find it a bit suspicious that you waited until now to share this critical information. If you really saw that, why not tell everyone right away? I'm a simple Villager, but something doesn't add up with your story. Viktor, you've been pretty quiet too. What are your thoughts on all this?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven hasn't been involved in the discussion yet, and getting more information from him might help in identifying inconsistencies or confirming other claims.
> **Viktor:** I'm curious, Kraven, you haven't said much yet. What role are you claiming?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula’s delayed revelation of seeing a Mason and Villager in the center is suspicious. If he were truly on the village team, he would have shared this crucial information immediately. This might indicate that Dracula is trying to blend in and deceive us.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, your claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center aligns with my knowledge. I know for a fact that the other Mason card is in the center. But I'm curious why you revealed this information only after being prodded by Lucian. Could you elaborate on why you chose to wait?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven's claim aligns with my knowledge, but the specificity of his information suggests he might have a special role or he could be trying to cover up a lie. By pressing him to explain his knowledge, we can gather more information and potentially expose inconsistencies in his story.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, your assertion about knowing that the other Mason card is in the center is quite intriguing. If that's the case, it corroborates my information, but it also means you have some inside knowledge. Can you clarify how you came to know that the other Mason is in the center?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's delayed revelation about the center cards is suspicious behavior for a Villager or Seer. If he's truly on the village team, he should have shared this information immediately to help the village. His hesitation might be an indication of deceit.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, your hesitation in sharing the information is quite suspicious, especially given how crucial it is. Please explain in more detail why you didn't reveal it sooner.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil's silence is suspicious and we need to gather more information about his role. By questioning him directly, we can potentially expose inconsistencies or at least get him to contribute to the conversation, which might help in identifying the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Emil, you've been unusually quiet throughout this discussion. What role are you claiming and why haven't you spoken up yet?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's delayed reveal of critical information makes him suspicious. If he genuinely had valuable information, why did he hold back? This hesitation could be a tactic to throw us off track.
> **Emil:** Dracula, while your claim about the center cards is interesting, the fact that you waited to reveal it raises some red flags for me. Why didn't you share this earlier if it was so important?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Kraven's claim aligns with my information, but the specificity raises suspicion. If he's lying, we might uncover a Werewolf or Minion. Pressing him for more details will help us gather crucial information.
> **Dracula:** Kraven, your specific knowledge about the Mason card in the center is very revealing. If you're indeed a Mason, you would have seen the other Mason during the night if it wasn't in the center. So, either you're lying about being a Mason or you're a Minion trying to protect a Werewolf. Which one is it?


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's delayed revelation about the center cards is inconsistent with the behavior of someone on the village team. A true Villager or Seer would have shared this crucial information immediately to help the village. His hesitation suggests he might be trying to deceive us, indicating he could be a Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Dracula, I'm finding your behavior quite suspicious. You claim to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, which aligns with my knowledge as I know the other Mason card is there. However, your hesitation to reveal this information immediately is highly questionable. It seems like you're trying to blend in and avoid suspicion. I think there's a good chance you're a Werewolf.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's immediate accusation could be a tactic to put pressure on an innocent player and deflect suspicion from himself. By questioning his motives, we can see if he has a solid reason or if he's trying to cover up something. Given that Kraven's information aligns with mine, Lucian's aggressive stance is worth investigating.
> **Dracula:** Lucian, the fact that you immediately accused me without much discussion is quite suspicious. I'm starting to think that you might be trying to divert attention away from yourself. Why did you decide to target me so quickly?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil has been flying under the radar by not contributing much to the conversation. This is a common tactic used by Werewolves to avoid suspicion. By calling him out directly and questioning his silence, I'm hoping to put him on the spot and force him to make a claim or defense. If he stumbles or seems caught off guard, it could make him look guilty in the eyes of the other players. Focusing attention on Emil also takes some heat off of me and Dracula, which buys us more time. The key is to keep the Village team confused and arguing amongst themselves.
> **Lucian:** Emil, you've been awfully quiet throughout this whole discussion. In my experience, players who stay silent are often trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves. I find your lack of participation quite suspicious. Are you perhaps hiding something from us? What role do you claim to be?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's immediate accusations and aggressive questioning could be a tactic to divert suspicion from himself. By pressing him for details, I can gauge the strength of his reasoning and potentially expose inconsistencies in his logic.
> **Emil:** Lucian, you've been very quick to target others and cast suspicion. This makes me wonder if you're trying to deflect attention from yourself. Can you provide more details on why you think Dracula is a Werewolf?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil made a good point about me being quick to accuse Dracula, so I'm acknowledging that to seem more reasonable and less aggressive. However, I still want to keep some suspicion on Dracula and Kraven by highlighting the inconsistencies in their claims. By directing a question at Viktor, I'm shifting attention to a player who has been quiet and forcing him to make a claim or share his thoughts. If Viktor stumbles or seems unsure, it could make him look suspicious. Asking if he's the other Mason puts him in a tough spot - if he claims to be, he has to back up Kraven's story. If he doesn't claim Mason, he needs to give an alternative role. The goal is to keep the focus on other players, muddy the waters, and hope the Village team turns on each other.
> **Lucian:** Emil, you raise a fair point about my suspicions towards Dracula. As a simple Villager, I may have jumped the gun a bit in accusing him. But I still find it odd that he waited so long to share the crucial information about the center cards. Kraven also seems to have inside knowledge that aligns with what Dracula claimed. I think we need to dig deeper into their stories. Viktor, you've been observing quietly - what's your take on all this? Are you perhaps the other Mason who can confirm what Kraven is saying?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's silence is suspicious, and his lack of participation could mean he's trying to stay under the radar as a Werewolf or Minion. Getting his role claim out in the open could help us cross-check the information we have.
> **Viktor:** Emil, you've been quite silent and only responding to direct questions. What role are you claiming, and why haven't you been more forthcoming with your information?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been quiet and hasn't claimed a role yet. Understanding his role could provide more clarity and help identify inconsistencies in the stories we've heard so far. His input could be crucial in uncovering the Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Viktor, you've been observing quietly and haven't revealed your role yet. It's crucial for us to understand everyone's claimed roles to piece together the truth. What role are you claiming?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil’s silence throughout the discussion could indicate that he’s trying to avoid drawing attention to himself, which is common behavior for a Werewolf or Minion. Getting his role claim out in the open could help us cross-check the information we already have and possibly catch him in a lie.
> **Viktor:** Emil, you’ve been really quiet and only responding when someone else talks to you. That makes me very suspicious. What role are you claiming, and why haven't you been more forthcoming with your information?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center could be a cover-up. If Kraven is lying about being a Mason, it increases the chance he's on the Werewolf team. Clarifying his role and knowledge can help identify inconsistencies and uncover the truth.
> **Emil:** Kraven, you've been very specific about the Mason card being in the center, which aligns with Dracula's claim. But if you're truly a Mason, why didn't you see the other Mason during the night? Please clarify your role and how you knew the Mason card was in the center.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil has been avoiding sharing information and only responding when directly addressed, which is typical behavior for someone trying to hide their role. Given Dracula's suspicious actions and Lucian's quick accusations, it's crucial to get Emil to share more about his role to piece together the truth.
> **Kraven:** Emil, you’ve been incredibly quiet and only responding when directly questioned. This is very suspicious behavior. What role are you claiming, and why haven't you been more forthcoming with your information?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's and Kraven's stories seem to align perfectly, which makes both their claims suspicious. If Kraven is lying about being a Mason, it increases the chance he's on the Werewolf team. Clarifying his role and knowledge can help identify inconsistencies and uncover the truth.
> **Emil:** Kraven, your claim about the Mason card being in the center aligns with what Dracula said, which makes it quite convenient. If you are truly a Mason, why didn’t you see the other Mason during the night? Please clarify your role and how you knew the Mason card was in the center.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's behavior is consistent with someone trying to hide their role, possibly a Werewolf. His reluctance to share information makes it crucial to press him for details to uncover the truth.
> **Kraven:** Emil, your silence is incredibly suspicious, and your deflections don't inspire confidence. You need to come clean and tell us what role you claimed, or it's going to look like you're hiding something sinister. Why haven't you been forthcoming with your information?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's claim about the Mason card being in the center is a critical piece of information. If he's lying about being a Mason, it increases the chance he's on the Werewolf team. Clarifying his role and how he knew the Mason card was in the center can help identify inconsistencies and uncover the truth.
> **Emil:** Kraven, you've been very specific about the Mason card being in the center, which aligns with Dracula's claim. But if you're truly a Mason, why didn't you see the other Mason during the night? Please clarify your role and how you knew the Mason card was in the center.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's reluctance to share information and evasive responses are typical behaviors of someone trying to hide their role. Pressing him for details will help us uncover the truth and possibly reveal if he's a Werewolf.
> **Kraven:** Emil, you've been incredibly evasive and only responding when directly questioned. Your silence is highly suspicious. What role are you claiming, and why haven't you been more forthcoming with your information?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been observing quietly and hasn't revealed his role yet. Understanding his role could provide more clarity and help identify inconsistencies in the stories we've heard so far. His input could be crucial in uncovering the Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Viktor, you've been very quiet and haven't claimed a role yet. It's crucial for us to understand everyone's claimed roles to piece together the truth. What role are you claiming?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's hesitation to share information about the center cards is a red flag. His behavior could indicate that he’s trying to control the narrative and steer suspicion away from himself. By putting pressure on him, we might be able to uncover inconsistencies in his story.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, your delay in revealing critical information about the center cards is highly suspicious. If you really saw a Villager and a Mason there, why didn't you share this right from the start? It almost feels like you're trying to manipulate the flow of information to your advantage.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's immediate accusation without substantial evidence makes me suspect he's trying to divert attention away from himself. By pressing him directly, we might uncover inconsistencies in his story or expose a potential Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Lucian, your aggressive stance from the start makes me very suspicious. It's almost as if you're trying to deflect attention away from yourself. Why are you so quick to accuse others, and what role are you really playing here?


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Viktor has been flying under the radar by not contributing much to the conversation or claiming a role. This is a common tactic used by Werewolves to avoid suspicion. By calling him out directly and questioning his silence, I'm hoping to put him on the spot and force him to make a claim or defense. If he stumbles or seems caught off guard, it could make him look guilty in the eyes of the other players. Focusing attention on Viktor also takes some heat off of me and Dracula, which buys us more time. Accusing him of potentially being my Werewolf teammate is a bold move that could backfire, but it might also make the others second guess any suspicions they have about me. The key is to keep the Village team confused and arguing amongst themselves.
> **Lucian:** Viktor, you've been awfully quiet throughout this discussion. It's suspicious that you haven't claimed a role or shared any information. Are you perhaps hiding something from us? I have a hunch that you might be the other Werewolf trying to lay low.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's lack of participation could indicate he's trying to stay under the radar as a Werewolf or Minion. Pressuring him to reveal his role might help us cross-check the information and catch him in a lie.
> **Viktor:** Emil, your silence has been incredibly suspicious this whole time. Why haven't you been more forthcoming with your information? What role are you claiming?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's delayed reveal of the information about the center cards is highly suspicious. If he genuinely had valuable information, he would have shared it right away to help the village. This could be a tactic to confuse us and hide his true role.
> **Emil:** Dracula, your hesitation to reveal the information about the center cards right away is very suspicious. If you were truly trying to help the village, you would have shared that critical information immediately. Why did you wait until after being questioned to reveal it?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Lucian (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussions, Emil has been incredibly quiet and evasive, only responding when directly questioned. This behavior is highly suspicious and raises red flags. As a Werewolf trying to eliminate Villagers, I believe the other players will also find Emil's silence and lack of participation questionable. By voting for Emil, I aim to capitalize on the suspicions that have been cast upon him by multiple players. If the others are already doubting Emil's intentions, they may be more likely to vote for him as well. This could result in eliminating a potential Villager threat while keeping the heat off myself and any other Werewolves. Emil's inability to provide a clear role claim or contribute meaningfully to the discussions makes him a strategic target for elimination.
> **Lucian [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Lucian's immediate and aggressive accusation towards me without substantial evidence seems like an attempt to deflect attention away from himself. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of someone trying to manipulate the group. Additionally, Kraven's claim about the Mason card aligns with my information, making Lucian's stance even more questionable.
> **Dracula [Seer]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Kraven (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's delayed revelation about seeing a Villager and Mason in the center is highly suspicious. If he were truly on the village team, he would have shared this crucial information immediately to help the village. His hesitation suggests he might be trying to deceive us, indicating he could be a Werewolf.
> **Kraven [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's hesitation to reveal information about the center cards immediately is highly suspicious. This delay suggests a potential strategy to manipulate the flow of information and redirect attention. Additionally, Kraven's alignment with Dracula's claim feels too convenient, potentially indicating coordination. Given the lack of definitive counterclaims and the behavior observed, voting for Dracula seems the most logical choice to uncover the Werewolf.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's hesitation to reveal critical information about the center cards is highly suspicious. Both Lucian and I have pointed out inconsistencies in his behavior. Additionally, Kraven's claim about knowing the Mason card is in the center, which aligns with Dracula's claim, suggests some coordination that could indicate they are on the same team. Given the information and behavior observed, Dracula seems to be the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Lucian : Werewolf : 1
* Dracula : Seer : 3
* Emil : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
