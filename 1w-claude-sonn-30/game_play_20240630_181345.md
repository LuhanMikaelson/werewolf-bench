## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Andrei. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Vladimir is a minion and is aware that Andrei is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Dragos. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Semira. They are thinking about their action.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can potentially reveal two roles that are not in play, providing valuable information to the village team. This also reduces the chances of false claims by the werewolves or the minion.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming to be the Seer and revealing supposed center cards, I can steer the conversation and control the narrative. I'm also targeting Andrei to make sure he doesn't get suspicious of me and to subtly guide the discussion away from him being a werewolf.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, everyone, let's get this started. I've noticed something interesting. I am actually the Seer, and I decided to check two cards in the center last night. What I found is that one of the cards in the center is a Villager, and the other is a Mason. That means our Werewolves are among us. Let's start figuring out who they are. Andrei, what role do you claim to have?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Vladimir's claim of being the Seer and seeing two center cards that make him look innocent is highly suspicious. As a Werewolf, I want to cast doubt on his story and make him look untrustworthy, to take the heat off of myself. By aggressively questioning his claim and motives, I can make the other players second guess if he's telling the truth. This puts Vladimir on the defensive and makes me look like I'm trying to root out deception for the good of the village, when in reality I'm just trying to save my own skin as a Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** I am just a simple Villager, Vladimir. I don't have any special powers or information. But I find it very suspicious that you claim to be the Seer and conveniently saw two center cards that clear you of being a Werewolf. How do we know you're not lying to cover for yourself? I think we need to dig deeper into your claims.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Andrei on the spot, I can gauge his reaction and see if he slips up. It also helps to subtly steer the conversation away from making him seem suspicious, which is my goal as the Minion.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, Andrei, you seem pretty defensive. It's understandable, given how tense this game can get. But if you're just a simple Villager, then surely you won't mind sharing who you think could be the Werewolf among us? We need to work together to root out the Werewolf, and we can't do that without everyone pitching in their thoughts.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to continue casting doubt on Vladimir's story to make him look untrustworthy, while also shifting attention to another player like Semira who has been quiet. By questioning why Vladimir waited to share his information, I'm implying he may have ulterior motives. And by calling out Semira's silence, I'm subtly suggesting she could be hiding something too, to take the heat off myself. I'll claim to be a Villager to seem more innocent and concerned with finding the truth for the good of the group.
> **Andrei:** I hear what you're saying Vladimir, but I'm still not convinced. If you really are the Seer, why wait until now to reveal this critical information? You could have spoken up right away and helped us narrow down the suspects. The fact that you waited makes me think you might be trying to mislead us. I'm just a simple Villager, but even I know that the Werewolves will say anything to avoid suspicion. We need to be very careful about who we trust. Semira, you've been awfully quiet so far. What do you make of Vladimir's claims?


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** If Vladimir is indeed lying about being the Seer, it would help us identify him as a potential Werewolf or Minion, given the information I know as the real Seer.
> **Semira:** Vladimir, I'm finding it very interesting that you claim to be the Seer and conveniently saw the same two center cards that I saw. If you were truly the Seer, and you saw those same center cards, what's your reasoning for revealing this information now? It seems like a convenient cover-up.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** By shifting the attention to Dragos, I'm involving another player and drawing suspicion away from Andrei. At the same time, I'm subtly casting doubt on Semira's claim without making it too obvious.
> **Vladimir:** Alright, Semira, your claim is quite interesting. But let's think logically here. If both of us supposedly saw the same two center cards and they are indeed a Villager and a Mason, that means both of us are either telling the truth or one of us is lying. Since I know what I saw, it’s clear to me that you might be the one trying to mislead everyone. However, I'm open to discussing this further. Dragos, you haven't said much yet. What do you have to say about all this? Any thoughts on who might be lying?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's claim of being the Seer was the first one made, making it more believable. Semira's delayed claim seems like a cover-up, and we need to press her for more details to see if her story holds up or falls apart.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's break this down step by step. If Vladimir and Semira both claim to have seen the same center cards, but only one of them can be the real Seer, it's likely one of them is lying. If Andrei is a Villager, like he says, we need to focus on the odd one out. Semira, your claim seems pretty convenient considering the timing. Why didn't you reveal your information earlier?


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** It's important to gather more information from everyone, especially from those who have been quiet. Dragos' response could help us determine his alignment and provide more context for understanding the truth between Vladimir and myself.
> **Semira:** Dragos, you've been quite neutral so far, but we need to hear more from you. What role do you claim to have and why did you choose to stay quiet until now?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira's delayed claim as the Seer is highly suspicious, especially since it mirrors Vladimir's claim. Confronting her might reveal inconsistencies in her story and help us identify the real Werewolf.
> **Dragos:** Alright, let's get to the bottom of this. Semira, you're claiming to be the Seer now, but your timing is suspicious. Why did you wait so long to reveal your role and the information about the center cards? Was it because you needed time to fabricate your story?


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** It's important to gather more information from everyone, especially from those who have been quiet. Dragos' response could help us determine his alignment and provide more context for understanding the truth between Vladimir and myself.
> **Semira:** Dragos, you've been quite neutral so far, but we need to hear more from you. What role do you claim to have and why did you choose to stay quiet until now?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's early claim gives him more credibility. Semira's delayed identical claim seems like a cover-up attempt. Focusing on her to expose inconsistencies could help in identifying the Werewolf.
> **Dragos:** Semira, your claim of being the Seer comes way too late and seems like a desperate move. Vladimir mentioned those center cards first, which makes his claim more credible. Why would two different Seers check the exact same cards? That doesn't add up. I think you're trying to cover for the Werewolves.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to see if Andrei’s defensiveness is a tactic to throw suspicion off himself. If he is a Villager, he should be cooperating more openly to find the Werewolves. His reaction to this direct question could reveal more about his true role.
> **Semira:** Andrei, you've claimed to be a simple Villager, but you seem very quick to cast doubt on Vladimir’s claims. If you truly are a Villager, you should be trying to help us figure out who the Werewolves are. Why are you so defensive?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Semira is now claiming to also be the Seer who saw the same center cards as Vladimir, which is extremely unlikely and convenient. As a Werewolf, I want to aggressively question Semira's motives for suddenly making this claim that contradicts Vladimir. By putting the focus on her suspicious timing and the improbability of two Seers checking the exact same cards, I can make her look untrustworthy and like she's grasping at straws. This deflects attention away from me and sows doubt about Semira, to increase my own chances of survival.
> **Andrei:** Semira, you're quick to turn the spotlight on me, but I think we need to take a closer look at your claims. You say you're the Seer and saw the same center cards as Vladimir, but why should we believe you over him? He spoke up first with that information. It seems like you might be trying to piggyback on his claim to look innocent. If you were really the Seer, why wait so long to share something so important? I'm just a simple Villager trying to sniff out deception, and right now, your story is not adding up.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** Dragos' neutrality and late involvement are suspicious. Andrei's reaction to this question might reveal more about their alignment. Since Andrei has been defensive, pushing him might force him to reveal more information or slip up.
> **Semira:** Andrei, considering you claim to be a simple Villager, what is your take on Dragos' unusually neutral stance? Do you think his reluctance to share earlier could indicate he might be hiding something?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dragos has been suspiciously neutral and quiet for most of the discussion, only chiming in to cast doubt on Semira's claim without offering much substance of his own. As a Werewolf, I want to shift the focus to his odd behavior and press him to reveal his role. By putting him on the spot and questioning his motives, I can make him look untrustworthy and like he's hiding something. This takes the heat off of me and sows further confusion and doubt among the group, which only benefits me as a Werewolf trying to avoid detection.
> **Andrei:** Dragos, I understand your skepticism towards Semira's claim, but your own neutrality is starting to raise some red flags for me. As a simple Villager, I've been trying my best to help root out the Werewolves by questioning inconsistencies. But you've been awfully quiet and noncommittal. It makes me wonder if you're trying to lay low and avoid drawing attention to yourself. So let me ask you directly - what role do you claim to have, and why have you been so hesitant to share your thoughts until now when our lives are on the line?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira's delayed claim and identical information to Vladimir's makes her story highly suspect. If she were truly the Seer, she would have revealed her information earlier to help us. Instead, she waited until Vladimir made his claim, which looks like she's trying to align her story with his. This inconsistency points to her being a Werewolf attempting to deceive us.
> **Dragos:** Everyone, we need to focus on the fact that Semira's claim is highly suspicious. She waited too long to reveal her Seer role and her information conveniently matches Vladimir's earlier claim. This timing is just too convenient, and it feels like she's trying to cover for herself. I think we should seriously consider the possibility that Semira is one of the Werewolves.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Both Vladimir and Semira can't be the Seer. Since Vladimir mentioned the center cards first, it makes Semira's claim dubious and potentially a cover-up.
> **Alexandra:** Semira, your claim of being the Seer seems very suspect to me. Vladimir was the first to mention the center cards, and your timing feels too convenient.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** If Vladimir is lying about being the Seer, it's highly probable he is on the Werewolf team. My role as the true Seer gives me the confidence to accuse him and try to gather support from the other players to vote him out.
> **Semira:** Vladimir, your claim of being the Seer is highly suspicious to me. You were quick to share the same center cards that I saw, which makes me believe you might be trying to cover up your true role. The timing of your revelation seems too convenient. I think it's very likely that you are a Werewolf.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** I need to keep the spotlight on Semira and Dragos while subtly casting doubt on Andrei without making it too obvious that I'm protecting him. By questioning Andrei's defensiveness, I can stir the pot and keep everyone from focusing too much on any one person, especially Andrei.
> **Vladimir:** Everyone, let's consider the facts carefully. Semira's claim as the Seer came suspiciously late, right after I already mentioned the center cards. Why would two Seers check the same center cards? It's clear that one of us is lying, and it seems more likely that Semira is trying to create confusion. Also, Dragos has been quite neutral and only started pointing fingers when he was pressured. This could be a tactic to avoid drawing attention. We should be wary of those who are too quiet and those who suddenly jump in with convenient counterclaims. Andrei, you seem quite defensive for a Villager. Do you have any solid reasoning for suspecting someone, or are you just trying to shift the suspicion away from yourself?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Alexandra has been suspiciously quiet, only speaking up briefly to side with Vladimir against Semira without providing much additional insight. As a Werewolf, I want to put her on the spot and pressure her to reveal her role and reasoning. By questioning her motives and lack of engagement, I can make her look untrustworthy and like she's hiding something. This shifts the focus away from me and sows further doubt and confusion among the group, which increases my own chances of survival.
> **Andrei:** Alexandra, you've been quite reserved so far, only chiming in to cast doubt on Semira without offering much of your own perspective. It makes me wonder if you're trying to fly under the radar and avoid drawing too much attention to yourself. In a game where our lives are on the line, we need everyone to be actively engaged in rooting out the Werewolves. So let me ask you directly - what role do you claim to have, and why have you been so selective with your contributions? As a simple Villager, I'm just trying to get to the truth.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos has been quiet and only started accusing when attention was on him, which seems suspicious. We need to understand his role better to determine his true motives.
> **Alexandra:** Dragos, your stance has been quite neutral, but now you're pointing fingers at Semira just when suspicions were directed at you. Why have you been so quiet until now, and why are you suddenly so sure that Semira is suspicious?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's defensive behavior and constant questioning without offering substantial information raises red flags. As a Mason knowing there’s no other Mason, I need to focus on finding inconsistencies in players who seem to be dodging direct answers.
> **Dragos:** Andrei, you’ve been quite vocal and defensive throughout this discussion, which makes me suspicious. You keep questioning Vladimir and Semira’s claims without offering any solid information of your own. If you’re truly a Villager, you should be helping us figure out who the Werewolves are. Why are you so quick to cast doubt on others while staying vague about your own role?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Alexandra has been suspiciously quiet and uninvolved in the discussion, only briefly siding with Vladimir against Semira without offering any substantive arguments of her own. As a Werewolf, I want to put her on the spot and demand that she reveal her role and reasoning. By aggressively questioning her motives and lack of participation, I can make her look untrustworthy and like she's hiding something nefarious. This shifts the focus away from me and sows further doubt and confusion among the group, which increases my own chances of survival as a Werewolf trying to avoid detection.
> **Andrei:** Alexandra, your lack of engagement is concerning. You've only spoken up to agree with Vladimir without providing any new information or insights. If you're truly a Villager trying to help us find the Werewolves, why have you been so passive? It feels like you're just trying to avoid drawing attention to yourself. I think it's time for you to step up and tell us clearly - what role do you claim, and what evidence do you have to support your innocence? Because right now, your behavior is looking very suspicious to me.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Dragos' behavior is highly suspicious. His neutrality and sudden accusations suggest that he might be hiding something. We need to get more information from him to determine his true motives.
> **Alexandra:** Dragos, you're being very neutral and only started pointing fingers when you were questioned. If you truly are a Villager or an innocent role, why have you been so passive until now? What role do you claim to have, and why did you decide to speak up only when the spotlight was on you?


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Semira's timing feels too convenient, and the odds of two Seers checking the same center cards are very slim. Vladimir's early claim makes him more believable, and Semira's delayed response looks like a desperate attempt to align her story with his. This inconsistency makes me believe that Semira is likely a Werewolf.
> **Dragos:** Alright, everyone, it's clear we need to make a decisive move here. Semira's delayed claim of being the Seer is highly suspicious to me. Vladimir was the first to mention the center cards, which gives his claim more credibility. Semira, why would two Seers look at the same center cards, and why did you wait so long to share this information? This doesn't add up. I think Semira is trying to cover for herself and possibly the Werewolves.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dragos has been conspicuously quiet and neutral for most of the discussion, only jumping in to accuse Semira once the heat was on him. As a Werewolf, I want to aggressively question his motives for this sudden change in stance and press him to reveal his role. By putting him on the defensive and making him look untrustworthy, I can sow further doubt and confusion, which takes the target off my own back. Dragos' wishy-washy behavior and selective participation are red flags I want to call out to make him seem like the one with something to hide.
> **Andrei:** Dragos, you raise a good point about Semira's suspicious timing. But I find it interesting that you're only now speaking up to accuse her, after being so neutral and passive earlier. It feels like you're trying to deflect attention away from yourself now that you're under scrutiny. I think it's time for you to come clean - what role do you actually claim to have? Because right now, your sudden shift in behavior is looking mighty suspicious to me.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's early claim and the matching center cards he mentioned make his story more credible. Semira's delayed claim looks like a desperate attempt to align her story with his, which is highly suspicious.
> **Dragos:** Alright everyone, let's think this through step by step. Semira's claim to be the Seer after Vladimir's initial reveal feels too convenient to be true. The odds of two Seers looking at the same center cards are incredibly slim, which makes me believe that Semira is trying to cover for herself. I think we need to focus on her and consider her as the primary suspect.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** Given that I am the real Seer and saw the same center cards, Vladimir's claim is highly dubious. His timing and the information he provided match mine too perfectly, indicating he might be lying to throw us off. The village team needs to focus on eliminating the potential Werewolf, and Vladimir's behavior points strongly in that direction.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's break this down logically. Vladimir's early claim of being the Seer and seeing the same two center cards as I did is highly suspicious. The odds of two Seers checking the exact same center cards are incredibly low, and the timing of his reveal seems too convenient. I strongly believe Vladimir is trying to cover for himself and possibly a Werewolf. We need to consider him as our primary suspect.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Alexandra's reluctance to share information and her passive behavior is raising red flags. If she's truly a Villager, she should be more actively involved in the discussion to root out the Werewolves. Her lack of engagement makes her a prime suspect, and we need to hear more from her to determine if she's hiding something.
> **Dragos:** Alexandra, you've been very reserved throughout this discussion. You only chimed in to cast doubt on Semira without offering much of your own perspective. If you're truly a Villager, why haven't you been more engaged in helping us identify the Werewolves? What role do you claim to have, and why have you been so passive?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir mentioned the center cards first, which makes his claim more credible. Semira's delayed claim seems like a cover-up. The odds of two Seers checking the same center cards are very low, so it’s likely she’s fabricating her story.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, everyone, let's think about this logically. Vladimir was the first to reveal the center cards, which gives his claim more credibility. Semira's delayed claim of being the Seer is highly suspicious. Why would two Seers look at the same center cards? This doesn't add up. I think there's a good chance that Semira is trying to cover for herself and possibly a Werewolf.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Vladimir (thoughts as Minion):*** Semira's late claim of being the Seer and seeing the same center cards as Vladimir is highly suspicious. The odds of two Seers checking the exact same center cards are incredibly low, and her timing seems like a desperate attempt to cover for herself. By aligning with the suspicions raised by Dragos and Alexandra, voting for Semira increases the likelihood of the village focusing on her instead of Andrei, who I know is a Werewolf.
> **Vladimir [Minion]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir was the first to reveal the center cards and Seer information, which gives his claim more credibility. Semira's delayed claim of being the Seer is highly suspicious and feels like an attempt to cover for herself and possibly a Werewolf. The odds of two Seers looking at the same center cards are very low.
> **Alexandra [Villager]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Based on the discussion, I believe voting for Semira is the best play. Her claim of being the Seer and seeing the same center cards as Vladimir is highly suspicious and seems like a desperate attempt to appear innocent. The timing of her claim, coming only after Vladimir revealed the center cards first, makes it seem like she was just piggy-backing on his information to avoid suspicion. It's extremely unlikely that two Seers would check the exact same cards, so her story doesn't add up. Additionally, several other players like Alexandra and Dragos have expressed doubts about Semira's credibility. By voting for Semira, I can cast suspicion off myself and side with the majority of the group. If she turns out to be a Werewolf or Minion, it will make me look like I was genuinely trying to help the Village. And if she's not, I can use that to sow further doubt and confusion to keep myself safe in future rounds. Overall, voting for Semira seems like the smartest move to blend in with the group and increase my own chances of survival as a Werewolf.
> **Andrei [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** Vladimir’s claim of being the Seer and seeing the same two center cards as I did is highly suspicious. The timing of his reveal and the fact that he provided identical information to mine indicate he might be lying to cover for himself and possibly a Werewolf. Given that I am the real Seer, Vladimir's behavior strongly points to him being the Werewolf. Voting for him aligns with my goal of eliminating the Werewolf and winning the game for the village team.
> **Semira [Seer]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Vladimir's claim as the Seer was the first one made, which gives it more credibility. Semira's delayed identical claim seems like a cover-up attempt. Additionally, the odds of two Seers checking the same center cards are very low, making her story highly suspicious. This points to Semira possibly being a Werewolf trying to deceive us.
> **Dragos [Mason]:** I am voting for Semira.


The votes were:
* Vladimir : Minion : 1
* Semira : Seer : 4



>***GAME:*** Semira was killed. The werewolves win.
