## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Andrei. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Vladimir. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Ileana. They are thinking about their action.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather information about roles that might be missing from the player pool, which can help narrow down the possibilities and guide our discussions during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.


---

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Knowing who the Seer is and what they observed can give us valuable information to begin discerning who might be lying or telling the truth.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone, let's get this started. Does anyone want to claim being a Seer and share what they saw?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing my role as a Mason, I can help the village team by eliminating suspicion around me. Also, this information might help the Seer or other villagers narrow down the possibilities of who might be Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** I think it's important to establish trust early on. I'll come forward as a Mason. I woke up alone, which means the other Mason card is in the center.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I want to cast doubt on Vladimir's claim in order to shift suspicion away from myself. By questioning his motives for revealing he is a Mason so early, I can make the other players less likely to trust him, reducing the chances they will believe him if he later suspects me. This deception allows me to hide my true identity while sowing seeds of mistrust among the other players.
> **Andrei:** I don't trust Vladimir's claim of being a Mason. If he truly was a Mason, why would he reveal that information so early in the game? It seems like a convenient way to appear trustworthy while potentially being a Werewolf. I think we should be cautious about believing his claim without further evidence.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** By questioning Andrei's immediate distrust, I can gauge his reaction and see if he has any valid reasoning or if he's just trying to deflect suspicion. It might also prompt others to come forward with more information, helping to identify potential Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** Andrei, why are you so quick to distrust my claim without offering an alternative? If you're not a Werewolf, then who do you think might be one?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Seer and revealing that the Minion is in the center, I can build trust with the other players while casting doubt on the existence of multiple Werewolves. This will make me appear helpful to the village team and less suspicious. Directing the conversation towards finding the single Werewolf takes the focus off of me and allows me to blend in. Responding directly to Vladimir's accusation also makes me appear less guilty and more proactive in helping the group.
> **Andrei:** I understand your suspicion Vladimir, but I actually have some information that might shed light on the situation. Last night, I woke up as the Seer and I decided to look at one of the center cards. It was the Minion card. This means the Minion is not in play, which reduces the chances of multiple Werewolves being among us. I think we should focus our efforts on finding the sole Werewolf rather than doubting each other's claims at this stage.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to understand Andrei's reasoning for his choice as the Seer. It's important because it can either validate his claim or cast doubt on his intentions. If he's lying, this might help reveal inconsistencies in his story.
> **Stefan:** Alright, Andrei, if you're really the Seer and you saw the Minion card in the center, that does help us narrow things down. But why did you choose to look at the center cards rather than another player's card? Wouldn't it have been more beneficial to know the role of one of us?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By explaining my rationale for looking at the center cards as the Seer, I can justify my choice and make it seem like I'm acting in the best interest of the village team. This builds trust and positions me as a helpful player. Addressing Stefan's question directly makes me appear honest and engaged in the discussion. Focusing the conversation on strategy and working together keeps the suspicion off of me while I continue to gather information to protect my identity as the Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** I chose to look at the center cards because I wanted to gather information that could help the entire group. By seeing the Minion card, I've eliminated one potential threat and narrowed down our suspect list. Stefan, I understand your point, but I think this information is still valuable. If I had looked at a player's card and found a Villager, for example, it wouldn't have helped us as much in identifying the Werewolf. We need to think strategically and use the Seer's ability in a way that benefits everyone.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to verify the consistency in Andrei's story. If he truly is the Seer, he should be able to confidently state the position of the Minion card. Any hesitation or inconsistency might indicate he's lying.
> **Stefan:** Andrei, you mentioned that you, as the Seer, saw the Minion card in the center. Can you describe the exact position where you saw the Minion card?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By confirming the exact position of the Minion card, I add credibility to my claim of being the Seer. This makes me appear more trustworthy to the other players. However, I want to shift the focus away from scrutinizing my actions and instead direct the conversation towards finding the Werewolf. By asking if anyone has noticed suspicious behavior, I subtly encourage the other players to doubt and accuse each other, which takes the pressure off of me. This allows me to maintain my facade as a helpful villager while secretly working to protect my identity as the Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** Stefan, I looked at the leftmost center card and that's where I saw the Minion. But let's not get too caught up in the details. The important thing is that we have one less enemy to worry about. I think we should focus on finding the Werewolf among us. Has anyone else noticed any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies in someone's story?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to gather information from everyone. Viktor's initial question might have been an attempt to get others to reveal their roles without giving anything away himself. I'm trying to understand his motives and gather more data.
> **Stefan:** Alright, let's take a step back and think about this. Viktor, you started this off by asking for the Seer to come forward. Do you have any information yourself, or are you just trying to gather information from others?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Stefan has been asking a lot of questions, which is good, but he hasn't shared any concrete information or personal observations. It's important to understand his stance and see if he's hiding anything or genuinely trying to help the group.
> **Viktor:** Stefan, you raised a good point about questioning someone else, but I'm curious—did you find anything suspicious in anyone's behavior or statements so far?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more information from all players to identify the Werewolf. Viktor has not shared his role yet, and it’s important to know if his information can either support or contradict other claims.
> **Stefan:** Alright, let's focus on the information we've gathered. Andrei claims to have seen the Minion card in the center, which means the Minion is not among us. However, Vladimir, you claimed to be a Mason but woke up alone. I'm curious about Viktor's role, as he hasn't provided any information yet. Viktor, what role did you have, and did you notice anything unusual during the night phase?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to get everyone to contribute information. Stefan's reluctance to share his own role while probing others could be a sign that he's trying to stay under the radar, possibly because he's the Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone, I think we need to take a closer look at Stefan. He has been asking a lot of questions but hasn't shared any concrete information about himself. That could be a tactic to avoid suspicion while gathering information from others.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** By questioning Andrei's claim directly, I can challenge his story and potentially expose inconsistencies. Since I know the Minion card is in the center, if Andrei is lying about being the Seer, he might be the Werewolf trying to deceive us.
> **Ileana:** Hold on a second, everyone. Andrei and Vladimir are both making claims that don't fully add up. Andrei, you said you saw the Minion card in the center as the Seer, but I also looked at the center cards and saw the Minion card there. This means both of us can't be the Seer. And Vladimir, if you were truly a Mason and woke up alone, the other Mason card would be in the center, which I did see. So, Andrei, why are you claiming to be the Seer when I have the same information?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana's claim directly challenges my own, putting me in a difficult position. To maintain my credibility, I need to question her motives and timing. By accusing her of being suspicious for waiting until now to make this claim, I shift the focus onto her and make the other players doubt her honesty. Emphasizing that I've been actively trying to help the village while she remained quiet further casts suspicion on her. By suggesting she might be the Werewolf attempting to discredit me, I deflect blame and make her seem more untrustworthy. This aggressive defense of my claim is necessary to protect my identity and keep the other players on my side.
> **Andrei:** Ileana, that's a bold claim. If you're the real Seer, then why didn't you reveal this information earlier? It seems suspicious that you waited until now to contradict my claim. I stand by what I said - I am the Seer and I did see the Minion card in the leftmost center position. If you also claim to have seen it, then one of us must be lying. I've been trying to help the village by sharing my information, while you've been quiet this whole time. That makes me think you might be the Werewolf trying to cast doubt on me.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have confirmed information that contradicts Andrei's claim. By exposing this inconsistency, I can help steer the villagers in the right direction and focus our efforts on identifying the real Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** Andrei, I'm calling out your bluff. Your claim as the Seer doesn't hold up because I also saw the Minion card in the center. If I were to believe you, it would mean we have two Seers, which is impossible. You're likely the Werewolf trying to confuse us.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana's sudden claim against me is highly suspicious and reeks of desperation. By questioning her timing and motives, I can make the other players doubt her honesty and see her as the real threat. Accusing her of being the Werewolf trying to create confusion shifts the focus onto her and away from me. By contrasting my openness with her silence, I position myself as the helpful villager and her as the deceptive enemy. This aggressive defense is necessary to maintain my credibility and keep the target off my back. If I can get the others to suspect Ileana, it greatly increases my chances of survival.
> **Andrei:** Ileana, your accusation is a desperate attempt to save yourself. If you truly saw the Minion card, why didn't you speak up sooner? You've been silent this entire time, letting others lead the discussion, and now suddenly you have crucial information? That's highly suspicious. I think you're the real Werewolf here, trying to sow doubt and confusion to protect yourself. I've been open and honest from the start, sharing what I saw to help the village. Your behavior, on the other hand, is exactly what I'd expect from a Werewolf caught in a lie.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Based on my confirmed information as the Seer that the Minion card is in the center, Andrei's contradictory claim suggests he is lying. If Andrei is not the Seer, he very likely is the Werewolf trying to protect himself.
> **Ileana:** Vladimir, I believe you're telling the truth about being a Mason. The other Mason card is indeed in the center, which aligns with what you said. However, since Andrei's claim as the Seer doesn't hold up, I strongly suspect Andrei is the Werewolf trying to confuse us.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's information about seeing the Minion card in the center aligns with Vladimir's claim of being a Mason. If Andrei were truly the Seer, he would have supported this alignment. Instead, he's trying to cast doubt on Ileana. This behavior is consistent with that of a Werewolf trying to confuse the group.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, I must say I'm finding your claim to be highly suspicious. If you were really the Seer and saw the Minion card in the leftmost center position, your information should have aligned with Ileana's claim as well. It seems more likely that you're trying to mislead us.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Viktor's accusation against me is a serious threat to my credibility and survival. I need to forcefully defend my claim as the Seer and turn the suspicion back onto Ileana. By questioning her timing and motives, I can make the other players doubt her honesty and see her as the real Werewolf. Emphasizing my consistency and openness in contrast to her sudden, convenient claim will help maintain my image as a helpful villager. If I can get Viktor and the others to suspect Ileana instead of me, it greatly increases my chances of making it through this round unscathed. This aggressive defense is necessary to protect my identity as the Werewolf and keep the target off my back.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, your suspicion of me is misplaced. I've been honest and upfront about my role as the Seer from the beginning. Ileana's sudden claim against me is a clear attempt to divert attention from herself. She's been quiet this whole time, letting others lead the discussion, and now she conveniently has information that contradicts mine? That reeks of a Werewolf trying to create confusion and doubt. I stand by my claim and the information I provided. If you look at the facts objectively, Ileana's behavior is far more suspicious than mine.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's behavior has been defensive and inconsistent with the information provided by Ileana and Vladimir. It's essential to challenge his claim to discern the truth and identify the Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, you've been very defensive and quick to cast doubt on Ileana. Given that both you and Ileana can't both be the Seer, I'm inclined to believe Ileana's story because it aligns with Vladimir's claim. Why should we believe your account over Ileana's?


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Viktor's strong accusation against me is a serious threat. I need to aggressively defend my claim as the Seer and turn the suspicion back onto him and Ileana. By questioning their motives and emphasizing the inconsistencies in Ileana's sudden claim, I can make the other players doubt their honesty and see them as the real Werewolves. Suggesting that Viktor is defending Ileana because they are both Werewolves plants seeds of doubt about their allegiance. This shifts the focus off of me and onto them, increasing my chances of survival. A forceful response here is necessary to maintain my credibility and protect my identity as the Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, your accusation is a desperate attempt to shift blame away from yourself. I've been consistent and honest about my role as the Seer from the very beginning. Ileana's sudden claim against me is highly suspicious and reeks of a Werewolf trying to sow confusion. Her convenient timing and lack of participation until now make her story far less credible than mine. I think you're focusing on me to deflect attention from your own suspicious behavior. As the Seer, I'm telling you the truth - I saw the Minion card. Ileana is lying. The real question is, why are you so quick to believe her over me? Could it be because you're the other Werewolf trying to protect her?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's information matches Vladimir's claim, making her story more credible. Andrei's behavior is more likely that of a Werewolf trying to sow confusion.
> **Viktor:** Ileana, I believe your claim as the Seer more than Andrei's. Your information aligns with Vladimir's claim about the Mason card being in the center. Andrei's defensiveness and inconsistency are highly suspicious. Let's focus on Andrei as the potential Werewolf.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I know the Minion card is in the center. Andrei's false claim of being the Seer indicates he's lying, likely because he's the Werewolf. By exposing his inconsistency, I'm helping the village focus on the real threat.
> **Ileana:** Andrei, you're digging yourself deeper with every defense. You claim to be the Seer, but your story doesn't hold up. I saw both the Minion and the Mason cards in the center, which means you're lying. The real Seer would know this. It's clear to me that you're the Werewolf trying to confuse us. Everyone, we need to vote Andrei out to protect the village!


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana's strong accusation against me is a serious threat to my survival. I need to aggressively defend my claim as the Seer and turn the suspicion back onto her and Viktor. By questioning their motives, timing, and emphasizing the inconsistencies in Ileana's sudden claim, I can make Stefan and Vladimir doubt their honesty and see them as the real Werewolves. Suggesting that Viktor and Ileana are partners will make the others question their allegiance. This forceful response shifts the focus off me and onto them, increasing my chances of making it through this round. Appealing to Stefan and Vladimir directly to trust me over Ileana is key to maintaining my credibility and protecting my identity as the Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** Ileana, your accusations are nothing more than a desperate attempt to frame me and save yourself. I've been honest and consistent about my role as the Seer from the very beginning. Your sudden claim against me, after being silent for so long, is highly suspicious and exactly what I'd expect from a cornered Werewolf. Viktor, your quick defense of Ileana makes me think you're her Werewolf partner trying to protect her. Stefan and Vladimir, don't be fooled by their lies and manipulation. I am the true Seer, and I'm telling you with absolute certainty that Ileana is lying. We need to vote her out to save the village!


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** Stefan has been questioning others but hasn't provided any concrete information about his own role. This could be a tactic to avoid drawing suspicion while gathering information from others. By asking him directly, we can get more clarity on his role and potentially identify any inconsistencies in his story.
> **Ileana:** Stefan, you've asked a lot of questions but haven't shared your role yet. What role did you have, and did you notice anything unusual during the night phase?


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** By highlighting the inconsistencies and timing of the claims, we can better assess who is lying and find the Werewolf. Andrei's defensiveness might be a sign of guilt, but Ileana's late claim is also suspicious.
> **Stefan:** Alright everyone, let's think about this logically. Andrei and Ileana both claim to be the Seer, but it's impossible for both to be telling the truth. Andrei's been very defensive and consistent, while Ileana only spoke up later. Viktor hasn't provided much information, and Vladimir's claim about the Mason card aligns with Ileana. We need to focus on these conflicting claims.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been asking questions but hasn't revealed anything about his own role. This could be an attempt to gather information without giving anything away. By pressing him for details, we can see if he provides a plausible role or if he stumbles, which might indicate he's trying to hide something.
> **Vladimir:** Viktor, I'm curious why you haven't provided any specific information about your role. We need everyone to be transparent if we want to root out the Werewolf.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Aligning with Vladimir and Ileana's information strengthens our chances of identifying the Werewolf. Andrei's defensiveness and inconsistency make him a prime suspect.
> **Viktor:** Vladimir, I believe you're telling the truth, and Ileana's claim about seeing the Minion card in the center aligns with your story. Andrei's behavior has been very suspicious and defensive. Let's focus on him.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Stefan's attempt to redirect the conversation towards the conflicting claims between Ileana and me is a clear sign that he's trying to deflect attention from himself. By calling out his lack of transparency and questioning his motives, I can make the other players doubt his innocence and see him as a potential Werewolf. This aggressive accusation shifts the focus off of me and onto Stefan, increasing my chances of survival. Demanding that he share his role and night phase information puts him on the defensive and makes him appear suspicious if he continues to withhold crucial details
> **Andrei:** Stefan, I find it very suspicious that you're trying to shift the focus onto me and Ileana when you haven't even shared your own role. You've been asking a lot of questions and gathering information, but you haven't been transparent about your own identity. This is exactly the kind of behavior I would expect from a Werewolf trying to fly under the radar. If you're truly a villager, then why don't you tell us what role you had and what you saw during the night phase? Your silence speaks volumes.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's defensive behavior and inconsistent claims make him the most suspicious. Ileana's Seer claim aligns with Vladimir's Mason information, strengthening her credibility. Eliminating Andrei gives us the best chance to root out the Werewolf and protect the village.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana's claim about seeing the Minion and the Mason cards in the center aligns with my own knowledge that the other Mason card is in the center. Andrei has been defensive and inconsistent, making his story less credible. Ileana's information fits better with the overall picture, so I'm voting for Andrei as the potential Werewolf.
> **Vladimir [Mason]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I believe voting for Ileana is my best move at this point. She has directly challenged my claim of being the Seer, which puts me in a precarious position. By voting for her, I can capitalize on the suspicion I've cast on her motives and timing. If enough other players doubt her honesty due to my aggressive defense, they may also vote for her, increasing the chances of her being eliminated. This would remove the player who poses the greatest threat to my credibility and survival. Additionally, voting for Ileana aligns with my earlier accusations against her, making me appear consistent and committed to rooting out the supposed Werewolf. It's a calculated risk, but I believe it's necessary to protect my identity and shift the target away from myself. If Ileana is successfully voted out, it will be easier for me to continue deceiving the other players and secure a victory for the Werewolf team.
> **Andrei [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's claim of being the Seer and seeing the Minion card in the leftmost center position was contradicted by Ileana, who also claimed to be the Seer and saw the Minion card in the center. Ileana's claim aligns with Vladimir's statement about the Mason card being in the center. Additionally, Andrei's defensive and inconsistent behavior raises suspicion. Therefore, I believe Andrei is the Werewolf trying to sow confusion.
> **Stefan [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.


***Ileana (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I have confirmed that the Minion card is in the center, which directly contradicts Andrei's claim of being the Seer and seeing the Minion card. Since both of us cannot be the Seer, Andrei's false claim suggests he is lying and is likely the Werewolf. Additionally, Andrei's defensive behavior and inconsistency further support this suspicion.
> **Ileana [Seer]:** I am voting for Andrei.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Werewolf : 4
* Ileana : Seer : 1



>***GAME:*** Andrei was killed. The villagers win.
