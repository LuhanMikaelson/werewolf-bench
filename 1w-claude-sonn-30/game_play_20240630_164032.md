## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Kraven. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Radu. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Cristina. They are thinking about their action.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I increase the chances of identifying unused roles and can better understand what roles are likely to be in play among the other players. This would help in making more informed decisions during the Day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible. If someone claims to be a Mason or Seer, it helps narrow down the possibilities and allows us to better identify potential Werewolves.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's get things started. Does anyone want to claim being a Mason or Seer? It's important for the village to get some early information.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene initiated the conversation, so it's worth seeing if she has any concrete information or if she is just prompting others to speak.
> **Emil:** Alright, I'm just a regular Villager here, but I think it's important to get some clarity early on. Selene, since you brought up the Masons and Seer, do you have any information to share, or were you just trying to get the conversation started?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to collect information from all players. This helps identify potential Werewolves and narrows down who can be trusted.
> **Selene:** I don't have any specific information, Emil. I just wanted to get the conversation started so we can gather as much information as possible. Does anyone have any leads on who might be the Werewolves?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I want to deflect suspicion away from myself and onto someone else. Radu has been quiet so far, so calling him out might make me look less suspicious in comparison. If I can get the group to focus on and eliminate Radu, that improves my chances of surviving to the end. I'll claim to be a Villager to seem more trustworthy.
> **Kraven:** I'm just a simple Villager, but I have a feeling that Radu might be hiding something. He's been awfully quiet so far. Radu, do you have any information to share with the group? We need to figure out who the Werewolves are before it's too late!


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's sudden accusation of me seems suspicious, especially since he didn't provide any reasoning. This could be a classic tactic of a Werewolf trying to deflect suspicion.
> **Radu:** Alright everyone, it's clear that we need to make some moves here. I believe that Kraven is trying to divert attention away from himself by accusing me without any solid evidence. We need to focus on finding the real Werewolves.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene started the conversation but didn't provide any useful information. As a Mason, I need to gather as much information as possible to identify the Werewolves. By pressing Selene to share any information she might have, we can either clear her as a Villager or put suspicion on her if she’s being evasive.
> **Radu:** Alright, everyone, I think it's important we get some concrete information to work with. Selene, you initiated the conversation but didn't reveal anything about yourself. Do you have any information that can help us identify the Werewolves?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven made an accusation without providing any evidence. It's important to understand if he has any real information or if he's trying to divert attention.
> **Selene:** Kraven, you seem quite eager to accuse Radu without any solid evidence. Why do you think Radu might be hiding something? Do you have any specific information or are you just trying to deflect suspicion?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene called me out for accusing Radu without evidence, so I need to explain myself to avoid further suspicion. By apologizing and framing my accusation as an attempt to get information and protect the village, I can appear more innocent and shift the focus back to Selene. Asking if she's the Seer or Mason pressures her to reveal something or look suspicious herself. This distracts from me and might bait useful information for the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Selene, you're right, I don't have any concrete evidence against Radu. But as a simple Villager, I'm just trying to get the conversation moving and gather information. Since you kicked things off, I assumed you might have some insights as the Seer or a Mason. If not, my apologies. I'm just eager to root out the Werewolves before they can strike!


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** By asking Emil for more information, we can either confirm his claim or catch any inconsistencies in his story. Gathering concrete details will help us identify the Werewolves more effectively.
> **Selene:** Emil, you claimed to be a Villager without any evidence. If we want to find the Werewolves, we need more concrete information. Can you tell us if you saw or heard anything during the night that might help us?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been quiet and defensive so far, which could indicate he is hiding something. Pressing him for information might reveal contradictions or useful insights.
> **Emil:** Alright, I think it's time we focus on getting some concrete information. Radu, you haven't revealed anything about yourself yet. Given that Selene and Kraven have been vocal, can you tell us what your role is or if you have any information that might help us identify the Werewolves?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Emil's insistence on getting me to reveal my role without providing any concrete information himself is suspicious. If he were truly a Villager, he would be focusing on finding the Werewolves rather than pressing me. This makes me think he might be hiding something, possibly even being a Werewolf.
> **Radu:** Emil, you seem awfully keen on getting information from me, but you've only claimed to be a regular Villager without any proof. If you were truly a Villager, you'd be more concerned about finding the Werewolves rather than trying to get me to reveal my role. Why don't you tell us more about what you did last night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been quiet and defensive, which could indicate he is hiding something. Pressing him for information might reveal contradictions or useful insights.
> **Emil:** Radu, you seem to be deflecting a lot and not giving us any new information. Everyone else has at least tried to get the conversation moving, but you're playing very defensively. What role are you claiming?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's initial accusation seemed like a deflection tactic. If he is a Werewolf, pressing him to explain his reasoning might reveal inconsistencies or force him to make a mistake.
> **Radu:** Kraven, you were quick to accuse me earlier without any solid evidence. This kind of behavior is very suspicious and typical of a Werewolf trying to shift the blame. Why did you choose to target me specifically?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Radu called me out for accusing him, so I need to apologize and justify my actions to seem less suspicious. By framing it as an attempt to get information and protect the Village, I look more innocent. Putting the focus on Cristina's silence pressures her to speak up and possibly reveal something useful, while making me appear proactive in solving the mystery. This distracts from me as a Werewolf and might yield information to help our team.
> **Kraven:** Radu, I only accused you because you were being so quiet and not contributing much to the discussion. As a concerned Villager, I'm just trying to gather information and get a dialogue going to root out the Werewolves. I apologize if it seemed like I was targeting you unfairly. Cristina, you've been quite silent as well. Do you have any thoughts on who might be a Werewolf? We could really use your input.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing the roles I saw in the center, I can help narrow down the possible roles that the other players could be. This information is critical for us to identify who might be lying about their role and thus might be a Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Everyone, I think it's important to consider that I saw the Minion and a Villager in the center. This means that those roles are not in play among us. We should focus on identifying the Werewolves based on what roles are left.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene started the discussion but has been evasive about her role. By asking her directly, we can get more specific information to help identify possible Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Selene, you initiated the conversation but haven't claimed a specific role. Given the importance of gathering accurate information, can you tell us what role you are claiming?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's information helps narrow down the possibilities, but we need more details to identify the Werewolves accurately. By asking for more concrete information, we can piece together the puzzle better.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's focus on gathering solid information. Cristina mentioned that she saw the Minion and a Villager in the center, which is useful. I want to know if anyone has any more concrete information from the night. Did anyone see any Werewolves or any other crucial details?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been deflecting and not contributing much to the discussion, which is suspicious behavior. Pressing him to reveal his role might give us more information or expose inconsistencies.
> **Selene:** Radu, your responses have been very defensive and you haven't provided any solid information. What role are you claiming?


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's behavior fits the classic pattern of a Werewolf trying to deflect suspicion. By accusing me without any justified reasoning, he might be attempting to divert attention away from himself. Since I am the only Mason and know that the other Mason card is in the middle, I need to focus on identifying the Werewolves. This makes Kraven a prime suspect.
> **Radu:** Everyone, I think we need to take a closer look at Kraven. He was quick to accuse me without any solid evidence and that kind of behavior is extremely suspicious. If he were truly a Villager, he would have been more focused on gathering information rather than pointing fingers randomly.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Cristina has provided some crucial information about the center cards, clarifying the exact positions of these cards could help us significantly in deducing the remaining roles and identifying the Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Cristina, you mentioned seeing the Minion and a Villager in the center. Could you tell us which specific cards you saw, and in which positions? This might help us narrow down the remaining roles.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil has been very vocal about others providing information but hasn't given us any concrete evidence or useful insights himself. Pressing him for specifics might help us determine if he's being truthful or trying to mislead us.
> **Cristina:** Emil, you claimed to be a regular Villager, but we need more than just claims to make decisions. Can you give us any specific information or insights you gathered during the night?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Understanding the exact positions of the center cards that Cristina saw will help us deduce which roles are still in play among us. This information is critical in identifying the Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Cristina, you mentioned seeing the Minion and a Villager in the center. Could you tell us which specific cards you saw, and in which positions? This might help us narrow down the remaining roles.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil's been pressing others for information without offering any concrete details himself. By asking him directly, we might be able to determine if he's being truthful or trying to mislead us.
> **Cristina:** Emil, you've been pretty vocal about wanting to gather information from others, but you haven't given us any concrete details yourself. What exactly did you do during the night, and can you provide any specific insights?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina's claim about the center cards is potentially key information. By getting her to specify the exact cards and their positions, we can better determine which roles are in play and identify inconsistencies in others' claims. This clarity could help us catch the Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Cristina, you've been quite reserved with your information despite claiming to have seen crucial cards in the center. Can you specify which exact cards and their positions? The more details we have, the better we can narrow down who might be the Werewolves.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil has been very vocal in asking for details from others but hasn't shared any significant information himself. Pressing him for specifics might help reveal if he's hiding something or if he's genuinely a Villager.
> **Cristina:** Emil, you've been pushing everyone for information but haven't given us anything concrete yourself. What exactly did you do during the night, and can you provide any specific insights?


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Knowing the exact positions of the Minion and Villager cards in the center will help us determine which roles are still in play among us. This critical information can uncover inconsistencies in other players' claims and help us catch the Werewolves.
> **Emil:** Cristina, you mentioned seeing a Minion and a Villager in the center, but you haven't specified which positions those cards were in. We really need this information to narrow down our suspicions and identify the Werewolves. Can you tell us exactly where you saw those cards?


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil has been very vocal about wanting information from others, but hasn't shared anything specific himself. Pressing him for details might help reveal if he's hiding something or if he's genuinely a Villager.
> **Cristina:** Emil, you've been quite persistent in asking for specific details from others, but you haven't given us any concrete information yourself. What exactly did you do during the night, and can you provide any specific insights? It's important for us to know your actions to narrow down who might be the Werewolves.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's initial eagerness to accuse Radu without evidence and subsequent silence could indicate he's trying to deflect suspicion. Pressing him for his role might reveal inconsistencies or useful information.
> **Emil:** Kraven, you've been quite vocal about accusing Radu without any solid evidence, and now you're being quiet. This kind of shift in behavior is suspicious. What role are you claiming?


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil has been pressuring others, particularly Cristina, for detailed information without providing any himself. This aggressive pursuit of information while being evasive is suspicious behavior that could indicate he's a Werewolf trying to gather intel while avoiding scrutiny. By calling out his lack of contribution and demanding he share his night actions, I can paint him as suspicious and put him on the defensive, which takes the heat off of me. It also makes me look more like an innocent Villager trying to get to the truth.
> **Kraven:** Emil, you've been pushing hard for information from others, especially Cristina, but you haven't shared anything concrete yourself. As a simple Villager, I find that quite suspicious. Why don't you tell us exactly what you did during the night? We're all trying to gather information to find the Werewolves, so it's only fair that you contribute too.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene initiated the conversation but hasn't revealed her role. Since she's been leading the discussion, it's crucial to know her role to ensure she's not trying to manipulate the conversation as a Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Selene, you've been guiding the conversation quite a bit but haven't given us any solid information about your role. Can you tell us what role you are claiming and any insights you gathered during the night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been suspiciously deflective throughout the discussion, not providing any solid information or claiming a role. This behavior is consistent with someone trying to avoid detection, such as a Werewolf. Combined with the fact that Cristina provided useful information and Radu continued to act defensively, it makes sense to vote for Radu in hopes of eliminating a Werewolf.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Emil (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been very defensive and hasn't provided any concrete information about his role. This kind of behavior is suspicious and suggests he might be hiding something. Additionally, his reluctance to reveal his role when asked repeatedly makes him the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf.
> **Emil [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Kraven (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Based on the discussions, Emil has been aggressively pushing others for detailed information, especially Cristina, without providing any concrete details about his own role or actions. This evasive behavior while demanding specifics from others is suspicious and could indicate that he is a Werewolf trying to gather intel while avoiding scrutiny himself. By pressuring Cristina for the exact positions of the center cards and not sharing his own night actions, Emil has drawn attention to himself. As a Werewolf, I want to capitalize on this suspicion and cast my vote for Emil. This has a good chance of aligning with the other players' votes, increasing the likelihood of voting out a non-Werewolf. It also helps maintain my facade as a Villager concerned with finding the truth.
> **Kraven [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Radu (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's initial accusation of me seemed like a deflection tactic typical of a Werewolf. He was quick to accuse without evidence and provided no concrete information. This behavior is highly suspicious and fits the pattern of a Werewolf trying to divert attention. Additionally, he has not offered any new insights or roles, making him the prime suspect.
> **Radu [Mason]:** I am voting for Kraven.


***Cristina (thoughts as Seer):*** Emil has been very vocal about asking for information from others but has not provided any specific details or insights himself. This behavior is suspicious and suggests that he might be hiding something, possibly as a Werewolf. Additionally, his persistent focus on gathering information without reciprocating could be an attempt to deflect suspicion away from himself. Given these observations, voting for Emil seems like the best choice to identify and eliminate a potential Werewolf.
> **Cristina [Seer]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Emil : Villager : 2
* Kraven : Werewolf : 1
* Radu : Mason : 2



>***GAME:*** There was a tie between Emil, Radu. The werewolves win.
