## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Semira. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Minion.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Emil. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Kraven. They are thinking about their action.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gain information about which roles are not in play. This will help narrow down the possibilities of who might be on the werewolf team and assist the village in determining the truth during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Mason, I can cast suspicion off myself as being a Werewolf. If anyone else falsely claims to be a Mason, I can say they are lying since I would know if I actually saw them or not. This puts pressure on the real Mason (if there is one) to reveal themselves, which could help draw out information. At the same time, by not revealing who I saw, I avoid others from being able to definitively contradict my claim
> **Semira:** I'm pretty sure I'm a Mason. I woke up last night and saw someone else, but I don't want to say who just yet. What I can say is that if you're also a Mason, you should know who I saw. So if anyone wants to claim Mason, I'll be able to verify if they're telling the truth.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to clear up potential misinformation and guide the group towards identifying the true Werewolves. By revealing what I saw, I am providing valuable information that can help the village team.
> **Kraven:** Listen up, everyone! I checked the center cards last night and saw the Mason and Minion. This means Semira cannot be a Mason. I suspect she's either confused or trying to mislead us.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's claim about seeing the Mason card in the center aligns with my knowledge as the only Mason. This makes me suspect that Semira might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive us.
> **Emil:** Semira, I think you're lying about being a Mason. I know that I'm the only Mason and the other Mason card is in the center.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Emil directly accused me of lying, so I need to defend myself and cast suspicion back on him. By challenging him to reveal the other Mason if he's telling the truth, I put him in a bind. If he can't name the other Mason, it will look like he's lying. This could make others suspect he's a Werewolf trying to frame me. Kraven's claim about seeing the Mason and Minion cards in the center also contradicts Emil, so drawing attention to that inconsistency helps my defense. I want to sow enough doubt about Emil's accusation to avoid the village uniting against me.
> **Semira:** Emil, I understand your suspicion, but I assure you I am a Mason. I clearly remember waking up and seeing another player's card. If you are truly the only Mason as you claim, then you should have no problem revealing who the other Mason is. The fact that you haven't makes me question your claim. I suspect you might be a Werewolf trying to cast doubt on me to protect yourself.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's claim about seeing both the Mason and Minion in the center aligns with what I know about my role as the only Mason. However, understanding his motivation for checking the center cards might help us determine if he's genuinely a Seer or if he's trying to deceive us. If he's lying, it could indicate he's a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Emil:** Kraven, I'm interested in what made you decide to check the center cards rather than someone else's card. Can you explain your reasoning for that choice?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to clarify the conflicting Mason claims to avoid being misled. If Emil can identify the other Mason, it will help us determine the truth.
> **Kraven:** Emil, you're claiming to be a Mason, and Semira is also claiming to be a Mason. Since I saw the Mason card in the center, one of you must be lying. If you're really the Mason, reveal who the other Mason is, because Semira's claim doesn't add up.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's claim aligns with my knowledge as the only Mason, but understanding his motivation for checking the center cards will help us determine if he's genuinely a Seer or if he's trying to deceive us. If he's lying, it could indicate he's a Werewolf or Minion. We need to clarify his intentions.
> **Emil:** Kraven, you said you saw the Mason and Minion in the center. That lines up with my knowledge since I'm the only Mason. But I'm curious, why did you choose to look at the center instead of another player's card? Were you trying to catch someone lying?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By pushing Emil to reveal the other Mason, we can verify his claim. If he hesitates or doesn't provide a valid answer, it casts more suspicion on him and helps us identify the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Emil, you're asking why I chose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card. The reason is simple: by checking the center, I could eliminate possibilities and know for sure which roles are out of play. That immediately helps us narrow down our options and catch any liars. Now, Emil, if you're really the Mason, tell us who the other Mason is or admit you might be mistaken.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's claim of seeing the Mason and Minion in the center aligns perfectly with my knowledge as the only Mason in play. Semira's claim of being a Mason is contradictory and suspicious, making her a prime candidate for being on the Werewolf team.
> **Emil:** Semira, your story doesn't add up. If you were truly a Mason, you would know that I'm the only Mason and the other Mason card is in the center, just like Kraven said. You're either a Werewolf or a Minion trying to deceive us.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene hasn't said much so far, which seems odd if she is the Seer. By directly questioning her and pressuring her to reveal what she saw, I'm trying to force her to either share real information that could expose my deception, or make a claim that others can poke holes in. If she stumbles or says something contradictory, it will make her look suspicious and take the heat off of me. Plus, by implying she's hiding something, I subtly suggest she could be a Werewolf, further shifting suspicion away from myself.
> **Semira:** Selene, you've been awfully quiet. As a Seer, I would expect you to have some valuable information to share. What did you see last night? Your insights could really help us figure out who the Werewolves are. Unless of course, you have something to hide...


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Given the conflicting claims between Semira and Emil, and Kraven's convenient verification of Emil's story, there seems to be a coordinated effort to cast doubt on Semira. If Emil and Kraven are working together, they could be the Werewolf and Minion duo.
> **Selene:** Emil, something doesn't add up. If you truly were the Mason, you wouldn't have hesitated to reveal who the other Mason is. And Kraven, your decision to look at the center feels oddly convenient. This kind of coordination between the two of you is suspicious.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's silence is concerning, especially given the claims made so far. If she truly has valuable information, her insights could help us identify the Werewolves. Pressing her to reveal her role and findings can either confirm or deny her alignment with the village team.
> **Emil:** Selene, you're being awfully quiet. As someone who could have valuable information, I find it suspicious that you haven't shared anything meaningful yet. What was your role and what did you see last night?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's decision to check the center cards instead of a player's card is suspicious. It could be a strategy to create confusion and support a false narrative. By questioning him directly, we might get more insight into whether he's telling the truth or trying to deceive us.
> **Selene:** Kraven, your explanation for checking the center cards just doesn't sit right with me. If you were genuinely trying to eliminate possibilities, wouldn't it have made more sense to check a player's card directly, especially since it would have given us a clearer idea about who might be lying among us?


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Selene's reluctance to share information is suspicious and we need to clarify her role to determine if she is hiding something or if she's genuinely confused. This will help us piece together the truth and identify the Werewolves.
> **Kraven:** Selene, I couldn't help but notice that you haven't shared any information about your role or what you saw last night. Given the confusion around Emil and Semira's claims, it's crucial that we have all the information on the table. Can you please tell us what your role was and what you saw during the night?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** If Semira truly is a Mason and saw another Mason, revealing the other Mason would help us determine who is lying. This could either help us clear her name or expose her as a Werewolf or Minion if no one else steps up.
> **Selene:** Semira, I believe you might be telling the truth about being a Mason. But why haven't you named the other Mason you saw? If you give us that information, we can cross-check and validate your claim.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene raised a valid question about why I hadn't revealed the other Mason, so I need to address that directly to maintain my credibility. By naming Mircea as the other Mason, I'm taking a calculated risk. If Mircea is the Minion, they may go along with my claim to avoid exposing themselves. If Mircea is a Villager, they will contradict me, but it will seem like an honest mistake rather than a malicious lie. Regardless, it shifts the focus to Mircea and buys me more time to push suspicion onto others, especially Emil who is claiming to be the sole Mason
> **Semira:** Selene, you make a fair point about me not revealing the other Mason. The truth is, I wanted to avoid putting a target on their back in case there was a Minion in play. But you're right, the group deserves to know. The other Mason I saw was Mircea. Mircea, can you please confirm this? If we have two Masons validating each other, that should clear up a lot of the confusion and help us identify the real threats.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** If Mircea confirms Semira's claim, it strengthens the credibility of Semira's Mason claim and casts more doubt on Emil and Kraven, who might be coordinating a false narrative.
> **Selene:** Mircea, can you confirm that Semira saw you as the other Mason? This information is crucial for us to determine who is telling the truth here.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene has not provided any concrete information about her role or what she saw during the night, which is crucial for us to piece together the truth. Pressing her for this information may help clear up the confusion and identify who is lying.
> **Mircea:** Selene, you've been very quiet about your role and what you saw last night. If you really have valuable information, now is the time to share it with us. What was your role and what did you see?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Given the conflicting claims between Semira and Emil, we need to validate Semira's statement to identify who is lying. If Mircea confirms Semira's claim, it will strengthen Semira's credibility and cast more doubt on Emil and Kraven.
> **Selene:** Mircea, it's time for you to confirm or deny Semira's claim. Are you the other Mason she saw last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** There is a contradiction between Semira and Emil's claims of being a Mason, and Kraven's observation that the Mason card is in the center. I need to challenge Semira's assertion to clarify the situation.
> **Mircea:** Semira, I can't confirm your claim because I am not the Mason you saw. This makes me question both your claim and Emil's claim. Since Kraven stated he saw the Mason and Minion in the center, it seems like the real Werewolves might be trying to confuse us by claiming Mason.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea's denial of my Mason claim directly implicates him as being deceptive. By suggesting he is either the Minion or a Werewolf collaborating with Emil, I'm painting them both as the main threats, which takes the heat off of me. If I can get Kraven and Selene to focus their suspicions on Mircea and Emil, they'll be less likely to scrutinize my claims. Pitting the other players against each other is key to avoiding detection myself.
> **Semira:** Mircea, your denial of being the other Mason is very suspicious. If you're not the Mason I saw, and Emil claims to be the only Mason, then it seems likely that you're either the Minion trying to protect Emil, or a Werewolf yourself. I suspect you and Emil might be working together to deceive us. Kraven, Selene, we need to seriously consider the possibility that Mircea and Emil are the real threats here.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's claim about seeing the Mason and Minion in the center is crucial. If we can understand his reasoning better, we might be able to determine whether he's telling the truth or trying to deceive us. This will also help us assess the conflicting Mason claims made by Semira and Emil.
> **Mircea:** Kraven, it seems like there's a lot of confusion around your claim of seeing the Mason and Minion in the center. Can you tell us exactly which cards you saw in the center and why you didn't choose to look at a player's card? This could help us understand your reasoning and verify your claim.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** By focusing on Mircea's role, we can eliminate some confusion and potentially identify the Werewolves. Given the false Mason claims, we need clarity from Mircea to make an informed decision.
> **Kraven:** Semira, Emil, and Mircea, this back-and-forth is getting us nowhere. We need to focus on real evidence. I saw the Mason and Minion in the center, so that should clear up the false Mason claims. Semira and Emil, you're both suspect now. Mircea, since you denied being the Mason, can you tell us what role you actually have?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Getting a better understanding of Kraven's choice can help us determine whether he's telling the truth and eliminate confusion around the conflicting Mason claims.
> **Mircea:** Kraven, your claim about checking the center cards and seeing the Mason and Minion is pretty convenient. Why didn't you choose to look at another player's card directly? This would have given us more concrete information about who's lying.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** We need to clarify Mircea's role to resolve the conflicting Mason claims and identify the true Werewolves. If Mircea is hiding something, it could indicate deception.
> **Kraven:** Mircea, your reluctance to share your role is suspicious. Semira's claim about seeing you as the other Mason doesn't add up if I saw a Mason card in the center. What was your role last night?


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's lack of information is a major gap in our understanding. If she is indeed the Seer or has some other crucial role, her input could help resolve the conflicting claims.
> **Mircea:** Selene, you've been very quiet about your role and what you saw last night. If you really have valuable information, now is the time to share it with us. What was your role and what did you see?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Kraven's choice to look at the center cards rather than a player's card seems like a calculated move to create confusion. This fits the behavior of someone who might be a Werewolf or a Minion trying to protect their team.
> **Selene:** I'm convinced that Kraven is trying too hard to push a false narrative. His explanation about checking the center cards instead of a player's card feels too convenient.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** If Semira is truly a Mason, revealing the other Mason would have helped us a lot earlier. Her reluctance makes me suspect she's either a Werewolf or a Minion trying to protect the real Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Semira, your claim about seeing another Mason and not revealing their identity initially is suspicious. If you're truly a Mason, why didn't you reveal that sooner? I think you're trying to mislead us.


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene's persistent attempts to cast doubt on my claims, despite the evidence pointing to Mircea and Emil as the real deceivers, makes her motives highly suspect. By aggressively challenging her and suggesting she could be a Werewolf herself, I aim to put her on the defensive and make the others question her credibility. This should take some of the pressure off me and allow me to continue pushing the narrative that Mircea and Emil are the true threats. If I can get Kraven to side with me against them, we may be able to eliminate one of the village team members, bringing us closer to victory.
> **Semira:** Selene, your accusation against me is baseless. I had a clear reason for not revealing the other Mason immediately - I wanted to protect them from being targeted by the Werewolves or the Minion. But now that Mircea has denied being that Mason, it's obvious that he's lying to cover for Emil. The real question is, why are you so fixated on discrediting me instead of focusing on the glaring inconsistencies in Mircea and Emil's claims? Could it be that you're trying to protect them because you're on the Werewolf team yourself?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Mircea's reluctance to confirm or deny specific roles and his failure to provide clear information is highly suspicious. If he's a Werewolf or Minion, his strategy might be to create confusion and protect his team. Pressuring him to reveal his role will help us gather more concrete information and identify inconsistencies.
> **Selene:** Mircea, you're being very evasive and have not provided any useful information so far. If Kraven's claim about seeing the Mason and Minion in the center holds any weight, you should clarify your role right now. What was your role last night?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Semira (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Based on the discussions, I believe the village is most likely to vote for Emil. He claimed to be the only Mason, which directly contradicts my claim of seeing Mircea as the other Mason. Since Kraven stated he saw the Mason and Minion cards in the center, Emil's claim appears to be a lie. Additionally, Mircea denied being the Mason I saw, further casting suspicion on Emil. By voting for Emil, I can capitalize on the doubts surrounding his claims and increase the chances of eliminating a village team member. This vote also aligns with my strategy of shifting focus away from myself and onto other players who have made contradictory or suspicious statements.
> **Semira [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Kraven (thoughts as Seer):*** Based on the information, I saw the Mason and Minion in the center, so Semira and Emil's claims of being Masons are suspicious. Emil's reluctance to name the other Mason and his continuous questioning of others without providing concrete evidence makes him the most likely candidate for being a Werewolf. Mircea's denial of being the Mason seen by Semira also adds to the confusion, but Emil appears to be the most deceptive.
> **Kraven [Seer]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Emil (thoughts as Mason):*** As the only Mason, I know for a fact that there is no other Mason in play besides myself. Kraven's claim about seeing the Mason and Minion in the center aligns with my understanding of the game state. Semira's insistence on being a Mason and then naming Mircea, who denied her claim, further strengthens the suspicion that she's trying to deceive us. Given the evidence, I believe Semira is either a Werewolf or a Minion trying to sow confusion.
> **Emil [Mason]:** I am voting for Semira.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's claim of being the only Mason conflicts with Semira's claim of seeing another Mason. Kraven's assertion that he saw a Mason and Minion in the center also contradicts Emil's claim. Emil has been evasive and has not provided clear information about who the other Mason is, despite being repeatedly asked. This inconsistency makes him the most likely candidate to be a Werewolf or a Minion trying to protect a Werewolf.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


***Mircea (thoughts as Villager):*** The conflicting claims between Semira and Emil about being the Mason, along with Kraven's assertion of seeing the Mason and Minion in the center, suggest Emil might be lying. Kraven's decision to check the center cards provides a logical basis for eliminating the false Mason claims. Semira's reluctance to reveal the other Mason initially could be seen as cautious gameplay. Selene's role and information remain unclear, but the strongest inconsistency appears to be with Emil's claim. Therefore, voting for Emil seems to be the best choice to eliminate a potential werewolf.
> **Mircea [Villager]:** I am voting for Emil.


The votes were:
* Semira : Werewolf : 1
* Emil : Mason : 4



>***GAME:*** Emil was killed. The werewolves win.
