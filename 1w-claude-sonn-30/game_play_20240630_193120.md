## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Ileana. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Michael is a minion and is aware that Ileana is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are no masons in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Radu. They are thinking about their action.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can potentially identify multiple roles that are not in play, which will help narrow down the possibilities and make it easier to identify the werewolves or other roles. This will provide more information to share during the day phase.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** If we can identify the Masons, they are definitely on our side. This will help us narrow down who the Werewolves and Minion might be.
> **Cristina:** I'd like to know if there are any Masons who can confirm each other.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing the center cards I saw will help narrow down the possibilities and might prompt Cristina to reveal crucial information, especially since she asked about Masons.
> **Radu:** I saw two cards in the center: one Villager and one Mason. That means we should have one Mason among us if the other Mason card is in play. Cristina, do you have any other information to share?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** If Radu can specify which card he saw as Mason, it might help us verify his claim. Additionally, if anyone else has seen anything contrary to Radu's statement, it could help us determine if he's lying.
> **Cristina:** Radu, if you saw a Mason in the center, can you specify which card it was? And has anyone else seen anything to confirm or refute what Radu saw?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing the center cards I saw will help narrow down the possibilities and might prompt Cristina to reveal crucial information, especially since she asked about Masons.
> **Radu:** I saw two cards in the center: one Villager and one Mason. That means we should have one Mason among us if the other Mason card is in play. Cristina, do you have any other information to share?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather as much information as possible. Ileana hasn't spoken yet, and she might provide crucial insights that could help us identify the Werewolves or confirm Radu's statement.
> **Cristina:** Ileana, do you have any information about other roles or what you might have seen during the night phase?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to cast suspicion off myself by claiming to have possibly seen a Villager card, even though I actually saw the other Werewolf card. This makes me look more innocent. By questioning Marius who has been quiet, I'm trying to put the spotlight on him and make him seem suspicious for not contributing. This takes the heat off me and onto another player.
> **Ileana:** I think I may have seen a Villager card in the center during the night phase. But I'm not entirely sure... it was hard to make out the card in the dark. Radu, you said you saw a Mason and a Villager, right? That would mean there should be a Mason among us. Marius, you've been pretty quiet - do you have any information to share that could help us figure out who the Werewolves might be?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to clarify the information Ileana provided because her uncertainty could mean she's either genuinely unsure or trying to deceive us. This could give us more insights into her role or intentions.
> **Marius:** Ileana, you mentioned that you might have seen a Villager card in the center, but you're not sure. Can you be more specific about what you saw and why you might be uncertain?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to address Marius's question but also cast a bit of doubt on what I claimed to see, to make my 'Villager' claim seem more believable. By emphasizing the uncertainty, it explains why a Werewolf might have 'accidentally' seen a Villager card. I'm then trying to shift the focus onto the Mason, to take the spotlight off of me and onto finding out if we have a confirmed Mason. The more I can get the others talking and looking at other players, the less suspicious I will seem.
> **Ileana:** Marius, you make a good point. I did think I saw a Villager card in the center, but it was hard to be certain in the darkness. The card looked like it had the Villager symbol on it, but I couldn't swear to it. I just wanted to share what I thought I saw in case it could be helpful, even if I'm not 100% sure. But going back to Radu's comment - if he definitely saw a Mason card in the center, then we should have a Mason player among us. Has anyone claimed to be the Mason yet? It would be really useful if they spoke up.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's claim could be very important, but we need more clarity. If he's being truthful, it would mean there is a Mason among us, which none of us have claimed yet. If he's lying, he could be a Werewolf or Minion trying to sow confusion. Ileana's uncertainty makes me suspicious, so we need to pinpoint solid information.
> **Marius:** Radu, I'm a little confused. You said you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, but Ileana seems uncertain about what she saw. Can you tell us which specific card you saw as the Mason?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Getting input from Marius could help us gather more information or possibly catch a lie. His silence needs to be addressed, and pressing for his details might reveal something useful for identifying the Werewolves.
> **Radu:** Marius, you've been quiet for a bit. Do you have any information to share about your role or something you might have seen during the night phase?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been vague and repetitive about the center cards, which could mean he's trying to deceive us. Clarifying his information can help us determine his trustworthiness and possibly identify the Werewolves.
> **Marius:** Radu, you've been repeating the same information, but you haven't specified which exact card you saw as the Mason. Can you clarify which card in the center was the Mason?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana's uncertainty might be a cover for something, and getting her to clarify could help us verify or debunk her claim. Plus, it might shed light on whether she's being honest or not.
> **Radu:** Ileana, you've been quite uncertain about what you saw in the center. Can you think back carefully and give us more details about why you think you saw a Villager card? Were there any specific symbols or elements that made you lean towards it being a Villager?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Radu has repeatedly mentioned seeing a Mason card in the center but hasn't given the specific card position. By calling out his vagueness and suggesting it seems suspicious, I'm trying to cast doubt on his claim and make him look untrustworthy, which takes the heat off of me. If I can get the others questioning Radu's motives, they'll be less likely to suspect me. Poking holes in his story is a way to make my own uncertain claim seem more believable in comparison.
> **Ileana:** Radu, you keep mentioning the Mason card but haven't specified exactly which center card it was. That seems a bit suspicious to me. If you're the Seer and actually saw those cards, you should be able to tell us clearly which position the Mason card was in. The fact that you're being vague about it makes me wonder if you're trying to hide something.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius has been deflecting and questioning others without providing any useful information himself. This could be a stalling tactic or an attempt to keep suspicion off of him. Pressing him for his own details could reveal more information or catch him if he's lying.
> **Radu:** Marius, you're being quite insistent on the details about the center cards. Why haven't you shared any information about your own role or what you might have seen during the night phase?


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina hasn't provided enough information after initially asking about the Masons. If she has a special role or more insights, it could help us clarify the current confusion and identify the Werewolves.
> **Marius:** I think it's time we hear from Cristina again. Cristina, you started by asking about the Masons but haven't shared any new information since then. Can you tell us more about your role or any observations you have?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's vagueness about the specific position of the Mason card is suspicious, and I want to press him for clarity. If he's the Seer, he should have no problem specifying which card was the Mason. If he's lying, this might expose him as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Cristina:** You know, Radu, you've mentioned seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center multiple times, but you still haven't specified exactly which card was the Mason. That seems suspicious to me. Why aren't you being clear about this? Are you hiding something?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's insistence on the specific position of the Mason card feels like a deflection. I need to understand her motives and whether she has more information or is trying to mislead us.
> **Radu:** Cristina, why are you so fixated on the exact position of the Mason card? It seems like you're trying to distract us from the real issue. Are you hiding something from us?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's vagueness and repetition without specifying the exact position of the Mason card make his claim seem dubious. If he is lying, this could help us identify him as a Werewolf or Minion. It's crucial to press for details to verify his claim.
> **Cristina:** Radu, I'm finding it really suspicious that you've repeated seeing a Mason and Villager in the center multiple times but still haven't specified which exact card was the Mason. If you are the Seer, you should be able to tell us clearly. Are you hiding something? What was the exact position of the Mason card in the center?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's focus on the Mason card's position seems like a deflection tactic to avoid sharing her own role. This suspicion needs to be addressed head-on to understand her motives and gather more useful information.
> **Radu:** Cristina, you've been fixated on the exact position of the Mason card and haven't shared any useful information about your own role or what you might have seen during the night. Why are you being so evasive? What exactly is your role, and why are you pushing so hard on this specific detail?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu's repeated vagueness and refusal to specify the exact position of the Mason card in the center seem like he might be lying about being the Seer. This makes me suspect he could be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** I think Radu is being suspicious by not clarifying the exact position of the Mason card he claims to have seen. If he were truly the Seer, he should be able to give us that detail without hesitation.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning both Radu and Ileana, I'm sowing seeds of doubt and confusion among the villagers while appearing to seek clarity. This helps protect Ileana as the werewolf and diverts attention away from me as the Minion.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, let's think this through carefully. Radu mentioned seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center, but hasn't specified the exact positions. Ileana said she might have seen a Villager card in the center but isn't sure. To me, this sounds like we have some inconsistencies we need to clear up. Ileana, are you absolutely certain you might have seen a Villager card, or is there a chance you could be mistaken? And Radu, can you finally tell us exactly which card in the center you saw as the Mason? Specific positions matter here because it affects our trust in your claim.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to address Michael's points to seem cooperative, while still allowing some uncertainty around my Villager claim to avoid getting caught in a lie. By reiterating that I'm not completely sure, it gives me an out if the card I named turns out to be wrong. I'm also joining the others in pressuring Radu on his vagueness, to make him seem more untrustworthy in comparison. Questioning his motives takes the heat off of me and keeps the group's suspicions on him instead.
> **Ileana:** Michael, you make a good point that we need to clear up these inconsistencies. I want to reiterate that I thought I might have seen a Villager card, but it was dark and I couldn't be 100% certain. The shape looked like it could be the Villager symbol, but there's a chance I could be mistaken given the lighting. Radu, I agree with the others that if you're sure about seeing that Mason card, you should tell us exactly which position it was in. Otherwise, it does seem a bit suspicious that you're avoiding that specific detail.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing suspicion towards Cristina, I can shift the focus away from Ileana and myself. Cristina's insistence on specific details without sharing her own role creates an opportunity to accuse her of being deceptive, potentially making her a target for the villagers' votes.
> **Michael:** Cristina, I think your fixation on Radu's specific card positions seems quite suspicious. It's almost as if you're trying to divert attention away from yourself. If you're so confident that Radu is being shady, then why haven't you shared any concrete information about your own role? What exactly are you hiding?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** If Radu is genuinely the Seer, he should be able to provide the specific position of the Mason card without hesitation. His continued vagueness makes me suspect he could be lying, which would help us identify him as a potential Werewolf or Minion.
> **Cristina:** Radu, you've been asked multiple times about the exact position of the Mason card you saw, but you keep dodging the question. This makes me really suspicious of you. Are you hiding something? If you are the Seer, then you should be able to tell us clearly. So, for one last time, where exactly was the Mason card in the center?


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's behavior has been evasive and overly focused on discrediting me rather than contributing useful information. Pressing her for details might reveal whether she's a Werewolf or hiding another role.
> **Radu:** Cristina, I find it highly suspicious that you keep pressing me on the exact position of the Mason card without offering any useful information about your role. You've been evading questions and seem to be trying to divert attention from yourself. So, Cristina, what exactly is your role and what did you see during the night phase?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's limited participation and only pointing out inconsistencies without providing new information make him a potential suspect. It's important to gather more details from him to help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, I think it's time we start narrowing things down. Michael, you've been pretty quiet this whole time and only chimed in to point out inconsistencies. Do you have any information about your role or something you might have seen during the night phase?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Cristina's insistence on specific details from Radu without sharing her own role makes her look suspicious. By directing the focus on her, I can divert attention away from Ileana and myself, creating doubt among the villagers.
> **Michael:** Alright Cristina, you're pressing Radu hard about the positions of the cards, but we haven't heard anything concrete from you about your own role. If you're so sure that Radu is suspicious, why don't you tell us what you did or saw during the night? It feels like you're deflecting. So, Cristina, what exactly is your role and what did you see?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's limited participation and only pointing out inconsistencies without providing new information make him a potential suspect. It's important to gather more details from him to help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Michael, you still haven't provided any concrete information about your role or what you saw during the night. Given that you've pointed out inconsistencies without offering new information, it's time you share your role and any observations you've made.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Cristina's repeated focus on Radu's specific details without providing her own information raises suspicion. By pressing her to reveal her role, we might expose inconsistencies that can help protect Ileana and shift the attention away from us, making it easier to manipulate the village's votes.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, we've been going around in circles a bit here, but I think it's time we address something that's been bothering me. Cristina has been very insistent on getting specific details from Radu about the Mason card, yet she hasn't disclosed anything concrete about her own role or observations. This deflection tactic is highly suspicious. Cristina, you need to come clean and tell us exactly what your role is and what you saw during the night phase.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's deflection tactics and lack of concrete information are making him highly suspicious. We need to know more about his role to determine if he could be a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Cristina:** Michael, you've been pointing out inconsistencies and calling people out, but you haven't provided any concrete information about your own role or what you saw during the night. Can you finally tell us what your role is and what you observed?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu repeatedly claimed to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center but refused to specify the exact position of the Mason card. This vagueness and avoidance of a simple detail make his claim highly suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, he should have no problem providing that information. This behavior suggests he might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to protect the real Werewolves. Voting for Radu seems like the best choice to identify and eliminate a potential threat to the village team.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Radu (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina has been excessively fixated on the exact position of the Mason card I saw without offering any useful information about her own role. This behavior appears to be a deflection tactic, which is often indicative of someone trying to hide something. Given her evasiveness and lack of concrete contributions, it is highly suspicious and suggests she may be a Werewolf trying to mislead the group.
> **Radu [Seer]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Marius (thoughts as Villager):*** Radu has been repeating the same information without specifying the exact position of the Mason card, which raises suspicion. If he were truly the Seer, he should be able to provide that detail. His evasiveness suggests he might be a Werewolf or Minion trying to confuse us.
> **Marius [Villager]:** I am voting for Radu.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Cristina has been pressing hard on Radu for specific details without sharing any concrete information about her own role or observations. This deflection tactic is highly suspicious and raises doubts about her intentions. By voting for Cristina, I align with the general suspicion and increase the chances of diverting attention away from Ileana, the werewolf, and myself, the minion.
> **Michael [Minion]:** I am voting for Cristina.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I'm voting for Radu because he has been consistently suspicious throughout the discussions. He claimed to have seen specific cards in the center as the Seer, but refused to provide the exact positions of those cards when pressed multiple times. This evasiveness and unwillingness to clarify his claims makes him seem untrustworthy. Additionally, multiple other players like Cristina and Michael pointed out Radu's vague responses and found his behavior suspicious. By voting for the player that others are already doubting, I reduce the chance of them looking closely at my own uncertain claims. It's safer for me to go along with the group's suspicions and vote out Radu, rather than risk them turning on me for defending him. With the inconsistencies in Radu's story, I believe the other players are most likely to vote for him, so that's my best play to avoid suspicion myself.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Radu.


The votes were:
* Cristina : Villager : 2
* Radu : Seer : 3



>***GAME:*** Radu was killed. The werewolves win.
