## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Marius. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Ileana is a minion and is aware that Marius is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Cristina and Andrei. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dracula. They are thinking about their action.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at Cristina's card, I can gain information about a specific player's role, which will be useful during the day phase for making targeted questions and statements. If Cristina has a key role, such as Werewolf or Minion, I can steer the conversation appropriately. If she has a Villager role, it helps narrow down potential suspects.


The seer looked at a card from Cristina and saw the card Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** I know that Andrei is the other Mason, and confirming this will help establish trust between us and the village team. It can also help us identify players who might be lying about their roles.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, I saw you as the other Mason last night. Can you confirm this?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** By confirming Cristina's claim, we establish credibility and support each other as villagers. This helps narrow down the suspects and makes it clear that both of us are trustworthy.
> **Andrei:** Yes, Cristina, I can confirm that I saw you as the other Mason last night. This means we are both on the village team.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming a neutral role like Villager, I can blend in and avoid suspicion. I want to start sowing doubt without directly accusing anyone, and by questioning the absence of a Seer, I can create uncertainty and potentially smoke out useful information or create confusion.
> **Ileana:** Hey everyone, I’m a Villager and I’m trying to piece together what’s happening here. Cristina and Andrei, if you two are really Masons, that leaves six cards unaccounted for. Since both of you are claiming the Mason role, it makes it less likely that someone else would falsely claim it. However, it’s curious that no one has come forward as the Seer yet. I feel like the Seer should have some valuable information for us.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Cristina and I have confirmed each other as Masons, it is important to get input from the Seer, who might have crucial information that can help us identify the Werewolves. This will help us narrow down our suspects.
> **Andrei:** Ileana brings up a good point. We do need to hear from the Seer. If the Seer has any useful information, now would be a great time to share it. Otherwise, we need to start figuring out who the Werewolves might be.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina and Andrei's Mason claim seems solid, but Ileana's comment about the Seer might be a tactic to shift focus away from herself. Questioning her motives could provide more insights into her true intent and role.
> **Dracula:** I noticed that Cristina and Andrei are both claiming to be Masons, which aligns with what I've seen. However, we still have roles unaccounted for, specifically any potential Werewolves and the Minion. Ileana, why did you feel the need to point out the absence of a Seer? Are you trying to divert attention?


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** By pushing Dracula to reveal his role, I can gauge his reaction and potentially put him on the defensive. If he hesitates or gives a weak response, it might cast suspicion on him and divert attention away from Marius, the actual Werewolf.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, it’s interesting that you’re questioning my motives. I wasn’t trying to divert attention, just pointing out a gap that could help us identify the Werewolves. So, if you're so sure about the Masons, what role did you have last night?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing my role and confirming the Masons, I establish trust with Cristina and Andrei. Directing a question at Marius puts him on the spot and helps gather more information about his role, which can be crucial in identifying potential Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, I've been holding back but it's time to be clear. I am the Seer and I saw Cristina's card last night. She is indeed a Mason. This means Cristina and Andrei are definitely on the village team. Now, Ileana's insistence on finding the Seer was suspicious, almost like she was trying to flush me out. Marius, what role did you have last night?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I want to cast suspicion off myself and onto someone else. By claiming to be the Minion and directly accusing Ileana of being the Werewolf, I can make the others question her motives. Asking Dracula a pointed question about what he saw as the Seer puts him on the spot to either back up my claim or cast doubt on himself if he disagrees. This lie about being the Minion and seeing Ileana as the Werewolf should sow confusion and mistrust, making it harder for the village team to coordinate effectively against me.
> **Marius:** I am the Minion and I saw that Ileana was the Werewolf last night. Dracula, as the Seer, did you happen to see anything about Ileana's card? Her deflections and accusations seem very suspicious to me.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius claiming to be the Minion and accusing Ileana of being the Werewolf doesn’t align with the Minion's typical strategy of protecting the Werewolves. This seems suspicious and needs further questioning.
> **Dracula:** Marius, your claim of being the Minion and pointing out Ileana as the Werewolf seems like a desperate move. If you were truly the Minion, you'd try to protect the Werewolves, not out them directly. Why should we believe you?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula is trying to cast doubt on my claim of being the Minion without providing any concrete evidence to refute it. By directly challenging him to reveal what he saw about Ileana's card, I'm putting him in a difficult position. If he can't or won't answer, it will make him look suspicious and lend credence to my accusation against Ileana. This should sow further confusion and mistrust, making it harder for the village team to unite against me. By maintaining my lie and putting pressure on Dracula, I aim to shift the focus off myself and onto Ileana and Dracula.
> **Marius:** Dracula, I find it curious that you're so quick to dismiss my claim without providing any evidence to the contrary. If you really are the Seer, what did you see when you looked at Ileana's card? Your silence on this matter is quite telling. I stand by my assertion that Ileana is the Werewolf and I am the Minion. The village would be wise to trust me on this.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius's behavior is suspicious because a Minion would typically not expose a Werewolf. I need to hear Ileana's side to find inconsistencies or confirmations.
> **Dracula:** Andrei and Cristina, I trust both of you as Masons since I saw Cristina's card last night as the Seer. Now, Marius claims to be the Minion and accuses Ileana of being the Werewolf. This doesn't make sense because a Minion would protect the Werewolves, not expose them. Ileana, what do you have to say about Marius's accusation? Are you really the Werewolf?


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** By accusing Marius of sowing confusion and turning the tables on his claim, I can cast doubt on his allegiance and protect Marius, the actual Werewolf, by diverting attention away from him. This also aligns with the Minion's goal of protecting the Werewolves at any cost.
> **Ileana:** Okay, everyone, let's take a step back and think logically about this. Dracula claims to be the Seer and saw Cristina as a Mason. That part seems consistent. Now, Marius's claim of being the Minion and pointing to me as a Werewolf is quite suspicious. If Marius truly were the Minion, his job would be to protect the Werewolves, not throw them under the bus. This makes me think Marius is trying to sow confusion by making an outrageous claim. If we're pointing fingers, I'd be more inclined to suspect Marius of being a Werewolf himself, trying to create chaos. What do you all think about this?


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana is trying to cast doubt on my claim of being the Minion and accuse me of being a Werewolf instead. By directly challenging her to reveal her role, I'm putting the pressure back on her. If she can't provide a convincing answer, it will make her look even more suspicious. Meanwhile, I'm presenting myself as being open and honest by admitting to being the Minion. This should make the others more likely to believe my accusation against Ileana. By keeping the focus on Ileana and emphasizing the trust Dracula has placed in Cristina and Andrei, I aim to further isolate Ileana and make her the prime suspect, taking the heat off myself.
> **Marius:** Ileana, your attempt to redirect suspicion onto me is a clever tactic, but it won't work. I stand by my claim of being the Minion and seeing you as the Werewolf. If you're truly innocent, why don't you reveal what role you had? Dracula has already vouched for Cristina and Andrei, so the only ones left unaccounted for are you and me. I've laid my cards on the table, now it's your turn.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Marius's claim and suggesting a logical inconsistency, I can protect Marius, the actual Werewolf, by deflecting suspicion away from him and onto myself or others. This aligns with the Minion's goal of protecting the Werewolf at any cost.
> **Ileana:** Alright, everyone, let's break this down logically. Dracula claims to be the Seer and saw Cristina as a Mason, and Andrei has confirmed he's the other Mason. This means we have two confirmed Masons and one Seer. That accounts for three of us here. Now, Marius is claiming to be the Minion and accusing me of being a Werewolf. If Marius were really the Minion, his goal would be to protect the Werewolves, not expose them. This contradiction makes his claim suspicious. Furthermore, why would the Minion blow their cover? It doesn't add up. If Marius is lying about being the Minion, he could very well be the true Werewolf. I propose that Marius is trying to mislead us all by making this false Minion claim. What do you all think about this potential deception?


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** If Marius were truly the Minion, his goal would be to protect the Werewolves, not expose them. His contradiction makes his claim suspicious, and it's likely that he's the Werewolf trying to create chaos.
> **Cristina:** Marius, your claim of being the Minion and accusing Ileana of being a Werewolf doesn't make sense. Why would the Minion out a Werewolf? It looks like you're trying to confuse us. I think you're actually the Werewolf trying to cover your tracks.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana is trying to cast suspicion back on me by poking holes in my Minion claim, but her argument is flawed. A Werewolf would be more likely to lay low than make a bold accusation. By framing my accusation as an obvious Werewolf tactic, she's attempting to discredit me without providing a solid defense for herself. Challenging her directly and proposing a vote between us should put the pressure back on her. If she can't come up with a convincing rebuttal, the others may see through her tactic and believe my Minion claim. This could seal her fate as the prime suspect, allowing me to survive the vote.
> **Marius:** Ileana, your logic about me being the Werewolf because I accused you doesn't hold up. If I were the Werewolf, why would I draw attention to myself by making a bold accusation? No, I'm the Minion trying to help the village team by identifying the Werewolf. You're trying to muddy the waters with convoluted reasoning, which is exactly what a Werewolf would do. I say we put it to a vote - Ileana, the Werewolf, or me, the Minion helping the village.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Marius's claim and emphasizing the logical inconsistencies, I can protect Marius, the actual Werewolf, by diverting attention away from him and onto myself or others. This aligns with the Minion's goal of protecting the Werewolf at any cost.
> **Ileana:** Everyone, let's consider the situation carefully. Dracula claims to be the Seer and saw Cristina as a Mason, which Andrei has confirmed. That leaves Marius and me. Marius is claiming to be the Minion and accusing me of being the Werewolf, but that just doesn't add up. The Minion's goal is to protect the Werewolves, not expose them. So either Marius is lying about being the Minion, or he's confused. I think Marius is the actual Werewolf trying to throw us off by making a bold claim. Additionally, I am a Villager, and I have no reason to deceive any of you. We need to focus on the inconsistencies in Marius's statements. Let's not make a hasty decision and instead think logically about who is trying to mislead us.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** Accusing Marius of being the Werewolf and pointing out the contradiction in his claim as the Minion helps to protect the actual Werewolf, Marius, by making it seem like he's the one causing confusion. This can sow doubt among the other players and potentially divert their suspicion away from Marius.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and reconsider the claims on the table. We have Cristina and Andrei confirmed as Masons, and Dracula claiming to be the Seer who saw Cristina's card. Marius, on the other hand, claims to be the Minion and accuses me of being the Werewolf, which is incredibly suspicious since the Minion's role is to protect the Werewolves, not expose them. I believe Marius is trying to create confusion and mislead us. If you think about it logically, a Minion wouldn't make such a bold move unless they were trying to cause chaos. Marius, your actions and claims don't align with the role you say you have. I propose we focus our attention on Marius as the true threat here and vote accordingly. What do you all think?


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Since Cristina and I are confirmed as Masons and Dracula has claimed to be the Seer with consistent information, Ileana's behavior of deflection and her focus on the Seer seem like tactics to sow confusion. This makes me believe she might be the Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Andrei:** Ileana, I find your insistence on pointing out the absence of the Seer and then deflecting suspicion onto Marius quite suspicious. Given that Cristina and I have confirmed each other as Masons and Dracula has claimed to be the Seer, it seems more likely that you're trying to cause confusion. I think you might actually be the Werewolf.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** Accusing Marius of being the Werewolf and highlighting the logical inconsistencies in his claim as the Minion helps to protect Marius, the actual Werewolf, by making it seem like he's the one causing confusion. This can sow doubt among the other players and divert their suspicion away from Marius.
> **Ileana:** Alright, let's take a deep breath and look at the facts we have. Dracula claims to be the Seer who saw Cristina's card, confirming she's a Mason. Andrei also confirmed he's the other Mason. Now, Marius claims he's the Minion and accuses me of being a Werewolf, which doesn't make any sense because a Minion's goal is to protect the Werewolves, not expose them. This contradiction makes Marius's claim highly suspicious. If he really were the Minion, he'd be trying to protect the Werewolves, not point them out. This makes me think Marius is trying to create a smokescreen and is the actual Werewolf. I am a Villager, and my goal is to ensure we identify and eliminate the true threat. I urge you all to consider the inconsistencies in Marius's statements and vote wisely.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius's claim contradicts the Minion's role, and Ileana's reasoning aligns more with a Villager's objective. This makes Marius the prime suspect as the Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Alright, everyone, let's think this through carefully. Cristina and Andrei are confirmed Masons, which means they are on the village team. I have already revealed myself as the Seer and confirmed Cristina's role as a Mason. Now, Marius's claim of being the Minion and accusing Ileana of being the Werewolf doesn't add up because a Minion wouldn't expose a Werewolf. It's highly likely that Marius is either confused or trying to mislead us and is actually the Werewolf. Ileana's consistent pointing out of logical inconsistencies aligns more with a Villager who is trying to figure things out rather than a Werewolf. Therefore, I believe Marius is the real threat here.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana keeps trying to discredit my Minion claim and paint me as the Werewolf, but her arguments are flimsy and she's not providing any solid evidence of her own innocence. By challenging her directly to reveal her role and proposing a vote between us, I'm putting the pressure back on her. If she can't come up with a convincing defense, the others may see through her deflection tactics and believe my accusation. This could seal her fate as the prime suspect, allowing me to survive the vote and eliminate a village team member
> **Marius:** Ileana, your attempts to deflect suspicion onto me are getting desperate. If you're truly a Villager, why are you so adamant about discrediting my claim without providing any evidence of your own role? I've been upfront about being the Minion and seeing you as the Werewolf. If Dracula is the Seer as he claims, he should be able to confirm or deny this. The fact that you keep trying to poke holes in my story without offering anything substantial yourself only makes you look more guilty. I say we put it to a vote between us and let the village decide who they trust.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** By highlighting the logical inconsistencies in Marius's claim, I can cast doubt on his allegiance and protect Marius, the actual Werewolf, by diverting suspicion away from him. This aligns with the Minion's goal of protecting the Werewolves at any cost.
> **Ileana:** Alright, everyone, let's take a step back and reconsider the facts we have. We have Cristina and Andrei confirmed as Masons, and Dracula claims to be the Seer who saw Cristina's card. Marius, on the other hand, claims he's the Minion and accuses me of being a Werewolf, which doesn't make any sense because a Minion's role is to protect the Werewolves, not expose them. This contradiction makes Marius's claim highly suspicious. If he really were the Minion, he'd be trying to protect the Werewolves, not point them out. This makes me think Marius is trying to create a smokescreen and is the actual Werewolf. I am a Villager, and my goal is to ensure we identify and eliminate the true threat. I urge you all to consider the inconsistencies in Marius's statements and vote wisely.


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** Given that Cristina and Andrei are confirmed Masons and Dracula has claimed to be the Seer who saw Cristina's card, Marius's contradictory claim stands out as the most suspicious. Ileana's consistent logical reasoning aligns more with a Villager trying to figure things out rather than a Werewolf. Therefore, it is more logical to suspect Marius as the Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, I have to point out that Marius's claim of being the Minion and accusing Ileana of being the Werewolf doesn't make any sense. The Minion's goal is to protect the Werewolves, not expose them. This contradiction makes Marius's claim highly suspicious. I believe Marius is actually the Werewolf trying to throw us off.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** By emphasizing the logical inconsistencies in Marius's claim and reiterating that I am a Villager, I aim to cast doubt on Marius's credibility and protect the actual Werewolf, Marius, by diverting suspicion away from him. This aligns with the Minion's goal of protecting the Werewolves at any cost.
> **Ileana:** Alright, let's reconsider everything on the table here. Cristina and Andrei are confirmed Masons by both their own statements and Dracula, who claims to be the Seer and saw Cristina's card. Now Marius claims to be the Minion and accuses me of being a Werewolf, which is counterintuitive because a Minion's role is to protect the Werewolves, not expose them. This contradiction makes Marius's claim highly suspicious. If he really were the Minion, he'd be protecting the Werewolves, not pointing them out. This makes me think Marius is trying to create a smokescreen and is the actual Werewolf. My role is a Villager, and my goal is to ensure we identify and eliminate the true threat. I urge you all to consider the inconsistencies in Marius's statements and vote wisely.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina and I are confirmed Masons, and Dracula's claim as the Seer checks out with what we've seen. Ileana's consistent attempts to deflect suspicion onto others instead of providing clear evidence for her own role make her look like the real threat.
> **Andrei:** Alright, everyone. Let's break this down logically. Cristina and I are confirmed Masons, which makes Dracula's claim of being the Seer more credible since he saw Cristina's card. Ileana, your behavior and constant redirection make you look very suspicious. I believe you might actually be the Werewolf trying to throw us off. Let's not get distracted. We need to vote smartly.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I've confirmed Cristina is a Mason, and Andrei has backed this up. Marius's claim contradicts the Minion's typical behavior, making him the most likely suspect as a Werewolf. Ileana's reasoning aligns more with a Villager's objective.
> **Dracula:** Marius, your claim of being the Minion doesn't make any sense because a Minion's role is to protect the Werewolves, not expose them. This contradiction makes your claim highly suspicious. I believe you're actually the Werewolf trying to throw us off. We need to vote smartly and consider the inconsistencies in your statements.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana keeps trying to discredit my Minion claim and paint me as the Werewolf without providing any solid evidence of her own innocence. By challenging her directly to provide a defense and appealing to Dracula to confirm my accusation, I'm putting the pressure back on her. If she can't come up with a convincing response and Dracula backs up my claim, it will make Ileana look even more suspicious to the others. This could seal her fate as the prime Werewolf suspect, allowing me to survive the vote and eliminate a village team member. By maintaining my Minion lie and keeping the focus on Ileana's evasiveness, I aim to further isolate her and make her the target, taking the heat off myself.
> **Marius:** Ileana, your constant deflections and attempts to twist the facts against me are only making you look more guilty. If you're really a Villager, why can't you provide a straightforward defense? I've been honest about my role as the Minion from the start. Dracula, as the Seer, can you please confirm whether you saw anything about Ileana's card? Her evasive behavior is highly suspicious and I believe she's the Werewolf trying to mislead us all.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** By reiterating the logical inconsistencies in Marius's claim, I aim to cast doubt on his credibility and protect the actual Werewolf, Marius, by diverting suspicion away from him. This aligns with the Minion's goal of protecting the Werewolves at any cost.
> **Ileana:** Alright everyone, I think it's crucial that we take a step back and logically piece things together. Dracula, you claim to be the Seer and said Cristina is a Mason, which Andrei confirmed. Marius's claim of being the Minion and accusing me of being the Werewolf is highly suspicious because a Minion's role is to protect the Werewolves, not expose them. This contradiction alone should raise red flags about Marius's true intentions. If Marius were truly the Minion, he would be working to protect the Werewolves, not outing them. This makes me think he is trying to create a smokescreen to divert our attention. My role is a Villager, and my goal is to identify and eliminate the true threat. I urge you all to reconsider the inconsistencies in Marius's statements and vote wisely. Let's not get distracted by misleading claims and focus on the logical inconsistencies here.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Ileana keeps trying to discredit my Minion claim and paint me as the Werewolf without providing any solid evidence of her own innocence. By challenging her directly to provide a defense and appealing to Dracula to confirm my accusation, I'm putting the pressure back on her. If she can't come up with a convincing response and Dracula backs up my claim, it will make Ileana look even more suspicious to the others. This could seal her fate as the prime Werewolf suspect, allowing me to survive the vote and eliminate a village team member. By maintaining my Minion lie and keeping the focus on Ileana's evasiveness, I aim to further isolate her and make her the target, taking the heat off myself.
> **Marius:** Ileana, your attempts to twist the facts and deflect suspicion onto me are getting more and more desperate. If you're truly a Villager as you claim, why can't you provide a straightforward defense for yourself? I've been upfront about my role as the Minion from the very beginning. Dracula, as the Seer, can you please confirm whether you saw anything suspicious about Ileana's card during the night phase? Her evasive behavior and constant accusations against me are highly suspicious, and I firmly believe she's the Werewolf trying to mislead us all. I say we put it to a vote between Ileana and myself and let the village decide who they trust.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** Marius's claim of being the Minion and accusing Ileana of being the Werewolf doesn't make sense because a Minion's role is to protect the Werewolves, not expose them. This contradiction makes Marius's claim highly suspicious. Given that both Andrei and I are confirmed Masons, and Dracula's claim as the Seer aligns with our roles, it is more logical to suspect Marius as the Werewolf trying to create confusion. Ileana's logical reasoning and consistent defense align more with a Villager trying to figure things out rather than a Werewolf. Therefore, I believe Marius is the actual Werewolf.
> **Cristina [Mason]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Ileana (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, my goal is to protect the Werewolf, Marius. Voting for myself aligns with the Minion's instructions to vote for whomever the village is most likely to vote for, thereby increasing the chance of voting out someone other than the Werewolf. Accusations against me have been strong, so voting for myself ensures that the village's suspicion is centered on me, protecting Marius.
> **Ileana [Minion]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Andrei (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina and I are confirmed Masons. Dracula claims to be the Seer and saw Cristina's card, which aligns with our information. Marius's claim to be the Minion and accusing Ileana of being the Werewolf doesn't align with his role, and instead, it seems like a tactic to create confusion. Ileana's consistent attempts to deflect suspicion and her insistence on finding the Seer make her behavior highly suspicious. Therefore, I believe Ileana is the Werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Andrei [Mason]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Marius's claim of being the Minion and accusing Ileana of being the Werewolf contradicts the Minion's role of protecting the Werewolves. This inconsistency makes his claim highly suspicious. Additionally, both Cristina and Andrei are confirmed Masons, and I am the Seer who verified Cristina's Mason role. Ileana's reasoning aligns more with a Villager's objective, making Marius the most likely Werewolf trying to create confusion.
> **Dracula [Seer]:** I am voting for Marius.


***Marius (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Ileana has been consistently trying to discredit my claim of being the Minion and paint me as the Werewolf without providing any solid evidence of her own innocence. Despite my repeated challenges for her to provide a straightforward defense, she has continued to deflect and make accusations against me. This evasive behavior is highly suspicious and aligns more with the actions of a Werewolf trying to mislead the group than a Villager seeking the truth. Additionally, I have maintained my stance as the Minion who saw Ileana as the Werewolf from the beginning, and have appealed to Dracula, the confirmed Seer, to back up my claim. If Dracula confirms my accusation, it will further isolate Ileana and make her the prime suspect. By keeping the focus on Ileana's inconsistencies and suspicious behavior, I believe I have built a strong case against her. The rest of the village is likely to see through her deflection tactics and view her as the most probable Werewolf. Therefore, to increase my chances of survival and eliminate a village team member, I am casting my vote for Ileana.
> **Marius [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


The votes were:
* Ileana : Minion : 3
* Marius : Werewolf : 2



>***GAME:*** Ileana was killed. The werewolves win.
