## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Cristina. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Michael is a minion and is aware that Cristina is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Mircea. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Selene. They are thinking about their action.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather valuable information about the roles that are not in play. This will help identify potential claims from other players during the Day phase and detect any inconsistencies in their statements, aiding the village team.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Mason


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming to be a Villager, I can blend in and divert attention away from Cristina, the Werewolf. Encouraging everyone to reveal their roles early can create confusion and potential slip-ups that I can use to my advantage.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, let's get this started. I'm curious about what roles everyone had. I'll start: I'm a Villager. We need to be careful about false claims, especially those made early on. Let's hear from everyone and see if we can spot any inconsistencies.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Revealing the roles I saw in the center can help us narrow down potential lies and identify inconsistencies in others' statements. It's crucial to share this information early to guide our discussions.
> **Selene:** I have some valuable information to share. Last night, I checked two cards in the center, and they were Villager and Mason. This means we have one less Villager and one less Mason in play than we might have expected. Keep this in mind when evaluating claims.


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's information seems plausible, but it's imperative to gather more data to ensure she's not bluffing or hiding something. By expressing skepticism, I can encourage others to provide their insights.
> **Mircea:** I'm a bit skeptical of Selene's claim. If she truly is the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, it aligns with what I know, as I'm the only Mason here. However, I want to know more from others before jumping to conclusions.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to clear up the confusion between Selene's claim of being the Seer and seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center, and Mircea's claim of being the only Mason. This will help us identify potential werewolves.
> **Semira:** Selene, I find your claim interesting, but I have some doubts. If you are really the Seer and saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, that would mean we have less certainty about the roles here. Michael claims to be a Villager, but if there are supposed to be three Villagers and one is in the center, then all three Villagers would be accounted for if Michael and I are telling the truth. Mircea, you claimed to be the only Mason, but your claim aligns more with Selene's statement. This creates a potential contradiction. Can you clarify any further, Mircea?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to scrutinize the claims closely to find any inconsistencies or contradictions. If Semira is lying about being a Villager, it could mean she's either a Werewolf or Minion trying to mislead us.
> **Mircea:** Semira, I'm curious about your claim of being a Villager. We already have Michael claiming to be a Villager, and according to Selene, there's one Villager card in the center. If she's telling the truth, that leaves only one Villager role unaccounted for. Can you provide more details or evidence to support your claim?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** I need to clarify Selene's claim about the center cards to understand the distribution of roles better. If she is truthful, it could help us narrow down the possibilities and identify inconsistencies in other players' claims.
> **Semira:** Selene, I'm having trouble understanding your claim as the Seer. If you really saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, that means we have only one Villager role left in play. Michael claims to be a Villager and so do I, which would account for all Villager roles. Can you provide more details about your night action or any other observations?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira's insistence on being a Villager when both Michael and Mircea have also claimed roles that align with my Seer vision is suspicious. Pressing her might reveal inconsistencies or force a clearer explanation.
> **Selene:** Semira, you've been questioning a lot of things, but you haven't really told us much about your role. Given Michael and Mircea's claims, and the fact that I saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, it's getting harder to believe there are more Villagers out here. Can you explain why you think you're a Villager, or are you just trying to confuse us?


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to get more clarity on Mircea's position and see if his reasoning for doubting Selene aligns with my observations. This will help in identifying inconsistencies in their claims.
> **Semira:** Mircea, you mentioned that you are the only Mason. If Selene is telling the truth about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center, that means there's one less Mason role in play, which supports your claim. But I can't help but feel that something is off. Can you tell us why you think Selene might be lying about being the Seer?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** Given the information so far, there's a contradiction in the Villager claims. If Selene is telling the truth, then either Michael or Semira must be lying, which means one of them could be a Werewolf or Minion. This needs to be addressed directly.
> **Mircea:** Alright, Michael and Semira, I think we need to clarify a few things here because this game is all about finding inconsistencies. Michael, you claimed to be a Villager. Semira, you also claimed to be a Villager. But based on Selene’s claim of seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center, this leaves only one Villager role in play. This setup makes it mathematically impossible for both of you to be telling the truth. So, one of you is definitely lying. Michael, why should we believe you over Semira?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Mircea's claim, I'm creating more confusion and diverting attention away from Cristina, the real Werewolf. This helps in ensuring that Cristina doesn't get voted out while also potentially causing friction amongst the Villagers.
> **Michael:** Mircea, you seem quite eager to pin the blame on me or Semira. What if you're actually the Werewolf trying to throw us off? Can you explain why we should trust your claim of being the only Mason over Semira's claim of being a Villager?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene's claim of seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center matches with my knowledge of being the only Mason. Since only one Villager role is left unclaimed, either Michael or Semira is lying. This contradiction needs to be addressed to find the Werewolf or Minion among us.
> **Mircea:** Okay everyone, let's break this down. We have Michael and Semira both claiming to be Villagers, but Selene has seen a Villager and a Mason in the center. This means one of these two is definitely lying. I'm inclined to believe Selene since her information aligns with what I know about the Mason card. So, one of you two, Michael or Semira, is not telling the truth. We need to figure out who the liar is.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Mircea seems overly confident in Selene's claim, even though it contradicts the roles claimed by other players. By questioning his readiness to believe Selene and dismiss the Villager claims, I can cast doubt on his motives and potentially shift suspicion away from myself. If I can get the others to consider the possibility that Selene is lying and Mircea is supporting her, it may protect me from being voted out.
> **Cristina:** Mircea, you raise a good point about the inconsistency between Selene's claim and the number of Villagers. But I find it odd that you're so quick to dismiss Michael and I. If Selene is lying, then it's entirely possible for both Michael and I to be Villagers. I think we need to consider the possibility that Selene might be a Werewolf trying to sow confusion. Why are you so eager to believe her over the rest of us?


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina's doubt about Selene being a Werewolf is valid, but based on the information we have, it's Michael and Semira's claims that create a direct contradiction. By addressing Cristina's concern and refocusing on the key contradiction, we can narrow down the possible Werewolf or Minion.
> **Mircea:** Cristina, I understand your concern, but let's think logically. Selene's claim of seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center aligns with what I know as the only Mason. This means there's one less Villager in play. Michael and Semira both claiming to be Villagers contradicts this information. One of them must be lying, and that's where we should focus our attention.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Selene directly and expressing doubt about her claim in a non-confrontational way, I can cast suspicion on her without seeming too aggressive. If I can get the others to doubt her story, it will take the focus off me and the inconsistencies in the Villager claims. I want to plant the seed that Selene might be mistaken or lying, which would mean Michael and Semira could both be telling the truth about being Villagers. This will hopefully muddy the waters and make it harder for them to pinpoint me as the Werewolf.
> **Cristina:** Selene, your claim about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center is very interesting. If that's true, it would mean there's only one Villager among the rest of us. But both Michael and Semira claim to be Villagers, which doesn't add up. I'm not saying you're lying, but it's a bit confusing. Can you explain how you're so sure about what you saw? Because if you're wrong, it changes everything.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina seems genuinely confused and trying to piece things together. Addressing her directly helps her understand my perspective and reinforces the logical reasoning behind my claim. This might also help create more pressure on Michael and Semira to reveal any inconsistencies.
> **Selene:** Cristina, I understand your confusion, but let me clarify why I'm so confident about what I saw. As the Seer, I had the ability to look at two cards in the center, and I saw a Villager and a Mason there. This means there's only one Villager role left in play. Since both Michael and Semira claim to be Villagers, one of them must be lying. If we can figure out who the liar is, we'll likely find a Werewolf.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly questioning Michael and pointing out the inconsistency between his claim and Selene's information, I can put pressure on him to defend himself. If he struggles to provide a convincing explanation, it will make him look more suspicious and take the focus off me. At the same time, I'm expressing support for Selene's claim, which should make me appear more trustworthy in her eyes. My goal is to create doubt around Michael's role and make him the primary target for elimination, protecting myself and any other Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Michael, you've been pretty quiet so far. As a claimed Villager, what are your thoughts on the inconsistencies between the number of Villager roles and the claims made? It seems like either you or Semira must be lying, or Selene is mistaken. I'm leaning towards trusting Selene since her information fits with what Mircea has said. Can you provide any evidence or reasoning to support your claim of being a Villager?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By asking Cristina to reveal her role, I'm subtly putting pressure on her to come up with a plausible claim. Since I know she's the Werewolf, this will help me gauge how well she's handling the situation and help me support her more effectively.
> **Michael:** Cristina, you've raised some valid points, but I want to know more about your role. If you believe Selene might be lying, then what role do you claim to have? We need to have all the cards on the table to figure out who the Werewolf is.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Minion, I can provide an alternative explanation for the inconsistencies in the claimed roles. If I say I saw there was only one Werewolf, it casts doubt on Selene's claim of seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center, since that would leave no room for a Seer. This should take the pressure off Michael and Semira, and make Selene look like the odd one out. Claiming Minion is risky, but it's a bold move that could shake up the discussion and buy me more time to figure out who I can trust.
> **Cristina:** Michael, you make a fair point about my role. Since I'm questioning Selene's claim, it's only right that I share what I know. The truth is, I'm the Minion. I woke up and saw that there was only one Werewolf in play, and the other Werewolf card was in the center. This means if we have two Villagers and a Mason accounted for, the last player must be the Seer. So either Selene is confused about what she saw, or she's deliberately misleading us.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Cristina on the spot, I can gauge how well she handles her claim of being the Minion. This will help me support her more effectively while diverting suspicion away from her as the real Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Cristina, if you're truly the Minion and woke up knowing that there's only one Werewolf in play, your information doesn't necessarily contradict Selene's claim about the center cards. But why did you wait until now to reveal your role? Are you trying to buy time or confuse us further?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly challenging Selene's claim and providing an alternative explanation based on my supposed Minion role, I can cast doubt on her information and make her look suspicious. If I can get the others to question her credibility, it will take the focus off any inconsistencies in the Villager claims and buy more time for the Werewolves to avoid detection. Claiming to be the Minion is a bold move, but it allows me to steer the conversation and put pressure on Selene to defend herself.
> **Cristina:** Selene, I understand your confidence in what you saw, but consider this: if I'm the Minion and I saw only one Werewolf, that means the other Werewolf card is in the center. This would leave no room for a Seer card, since we already have two Villagers and a Mason claimed. So either you're mistaken about what you saw, or you're deliberately trying to mislead us. I'm not saying I don't believe you, but your information doesn't quite add up with what I know.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's claim of being the Minion seems to be an attempt to sow confusion and protect the real Werewolf. If she truly is the Minion, she should provide more specific information about who she saw as the Werewolf to help us narrow down the suspects.
> **Selene:** Cristina, your claim of being the Minion is highly suspicious since it aligns with the Werewolf team's goal. If you're really the Minion, you would know the Werewolf, and we need to identify them. Can you tell us who you saw as the Werewolf?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By aggressively questioning Selene's motives and challenging her to name the Werewolf, I can put her on the defensive and make her look suspicious for accusing me. If she struggles to give a convincing answer, it will undermine her credibility and make the others doubt her claim of being the Seer. This should take the pressure off me and the other Werewolves, and buy us more time to avoid detection. Pushing Selene to make an accusation could also reveal valuable information about who she suspects, which I can use to strategize moving forward.
> **Cristina:** Selene, I find it very strange that you're accusing me of being suspicious just for sharing what I know as the Minion. If I wanted to help the Werewolves, I could have easily stayed silent. Instead, I'm trying to point out the inconsistencies in your story. You claim to have seen a Villager and a Mason in the center, but that doesn't leave room for a Seer card if we account for the other claimed roles. I think you're trying to cast doubt on me to protect yourself. If you're so sure about what you saw, why don't you tell us who you think the Werewolf is?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's claim of being the Minion seems like an attempt to protect the real Werewolf. If she's really the Minion, she should help us identify the Werewolf to clear up this confusion.
> **Selene:** Cristina, your claim of being the Minion seems convenient and suspicious. If you truly are the Minion, you should know who the Werewolf is. Why haven't you provided that critical information yet?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By turning Selene's accusation back on her and challenging her to explain the inconsistencies in her claimed Seer role, I can shift the focus away from my supposed Minion role and make her look more suspicious. If she struggles to provide a convincing explanation for why her information doesn't align with the other claimed roles, it will undermine her credibility and make the others question whether she's telling the truth about being the Seer. This should take the pressure off me and buy more time for the Werewolves to avoid detection, while also revealing valuable information about who Selene might suspect.
> **Cristina:** Selene, you're putting me in a tough spot by demanding I name the Werewolf. As the Minion, I know there's only one Werewolf, but I didn't see their specific identity. What I do know is that your claim about the center cards doesn't add up with the other roles claimed. You're trying to pressure me to make an accusation, but I think you're the one who needs to explain the inconsistencies in your story. If you're not the Seer, then who are you really?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's claim aligns with the Werewolf team's strategy of sowing confusion and protecting the Werewolf. Pressing her to reveal who she thinks the Werewolf is might expose her deception or force her to provide more clarity.
> **Selene:** Cristina, I'm finding your claim of being the Minion very suspicious. If you're really the Minion, you would know which player is the Werewolf. You're deflecting and causing confusion, which is exactly what a Minion would do to protect their Werewolf. So, I have to ask, who do you think the Werewolf is?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By aggressively questioning Selene's motives and challenging her to name the Werewolf herself, I can put her on the defensive and make her look suspicious for accusing me without evidence. If she struggles to give a convincing answer or make a direct accusation, it will undermine her credibility and make the others doubt her claim of being the Seer. This should take the pressure off me and the other Werewolves, and force Selene to either make a risky guess or admit that she's uncertain. Either way, it will buy us more time to avoid detection and cast doubt on the person most likely to identify us.
> **Cristina:** Selene, I understand your suspicion, but you're putting me in an unfair position. As the Minion, I know there's only one Werewolf, but I don't know their specific identity. What I do know is that your claim about the center cards contradicts the other roles that have been shared. You're trying to pressure me to make an accusation to deflect from the inconsistencies in your own story. If you're so confident in what you saw as the Seer, why don't you tell us who you think the Werewolf is?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Cristina's evasiveness and the lack of concrete information from her claim as the Minion seem designed to protect the real Werewolf. By pressing her for an answer, we might expose her deception or at least gain more clarity on her motives.
> **Selene:** Cristina, I find your claim of being the Minion very suspicious, especially since you haven't provided any insight into who you think the Werewolf might be. If you're truly the Minion, your primary goal should be to protect the Werewolf by sowing confusion, which is exactly what you're doing. So let me ask you directly: who do you think is the Werewolf?


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By aggressively questioning Selene's motives and challenging her to name the Werewolf herself, I can put her on the defensive and make her look suspicious for accusing me without proof. If she can't give a convincing answer or make a direct accusation, it will damage her credibility and make the others doubt her claim of being the Seer. This should take the heat off me and the other Werewolves, and force Selene to either make a risky guess or admit that she's uncertain. Either way, it will buy us more time to avoid detection and cast serious doubt on the person most likely to identify us.
> **Cristina:** Selene, I understand your suspicion, but you're putting me in a very difficult position by demanding I name the Werewolf. The truth is, I don't know their specific identity. What I do know is that your claim about the center cards contradicts the other roles that have been shared. You're trying to pressure me to make an accusation without any concrete evidence, which seems like a tactic to deflect attention from the holes in your own story. If you're so sure about what you saw as the Seer, why don't you tell us who you think the Werewolf is?


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's silence and the inconsistency between the number of Villager roles and the claims made suggest that he might be lying. Pressing him for more details can help expose inconsistencies or reveal his true role.
> **Selene:** Michael, you have been pretty quiet throughout this discussion, and I'm starting to think you might be hiding something. If there is only one Villager role left and Semira and Cristina are both claiming roles that align with my vision, your claim of being a Villager is highly suspicious. Can you provide any more details or evidence to support your claim of being a Villager?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Selene's claim and questioning her decision to look at center cards, I'm trying to shift suspicion away from Cristina and create confusion among the Villagers. This will help protect Cristina and increase our chances of winning.
> **Michael:** Listen everyone, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated here. We have Selene claiming to be the Seer and having seen a Villager and a Mason in the center. That leaves one Villager role unaccounted for. Cristina claims to be the Minion and somehow knows there's only one Werewolf. Meanwhile, Semira and I are both claiming Villager, which logically, doesn't add up if Selene's information is accurate. Mircea, you claim to be the only Mason, which aligns with Selene. But here's the thing: if Selene is really the Seer, why didn't she look at a player's card instead of two center cards? It seems like a safer bet to confirm an actual player's role rather than adding confusion with center cards. Something's fishy. I'm starting to believe that Selene might actually be the Werewolf here, trying to mislead us with false Seer information. We need to think about this logically.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Selene's claim of being the Seer and checking two center cards has created more confusion than clarity. Her information about seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center contradicts the roles claimed by others. By casting doubt on her, we can create enough uncertainty to protect Cristina, the Werewolf. Additionally, Selene's insistence on questioning everyone else while providing potentially misleading information makes her a good target to divert attention away from the real Werewolf.
> **Michael [Minion]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Selene (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's claim to be a Villager is highly suspicious given the information I provided as the Seer. I saw a Villager and a Mason in the center, which means there can only be one Villager role left in play. Both Michael and Semira are claiming to be Villagers, which is mathematically impossible if my information is correct. Michael has also been relatively quiet and did not provide strong evidence to support his claim of being a Villager. Therefore, I believe Michael is more likely to be lying and may be the Werewolf.
> **Selene [Seer]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Mircea (thoughts as Mason):*** Based on the information we have, Selene's claim of seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center aligns with my knowledge as the only Mason. This makes Selene's claim more credible. With only one Villager role left unaccounted for, and both Michael and Semira claiming to be Villagers, one of them must be lying. Cristina's claim to be the Minion adds another layer of complexity, but Michael has been less consistent and more defensive, which raises suspicion. Therefore, I believe Michael is likely the Werewolf trying to sow confusion.
> **Mircea [Mason]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Semira (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's claim of being the Seer and seeing a Villager and a Mason in the center doesn't align with the claims of other players. If Selene's information were accurate, there would be inconsistencies with the number of Villager roles claimed. Additionally, Cristina's claim of being the Minion and knowing there's only one Werewolf adds further doubt to Selene's Seer claim. Michael's point about the Seer typically checking a player's card rather than two center cards also raises suspicion. Given the available information, voting for Selene as potentially the Werewolf seems the most logical choice.
> **Semira [Villager]:** I am voting for Selene.


***Cristina (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Based on the discussion, I believe Selene is the most suspicious player and the one most likely to be voted out by the others. Her claim of being the Seer and seeing a Villager and Mason in the center has caused a lot of confusion and inconsistencies with the other claimed roles. If her information is true, it would mean that either Michael or Semira is lying about being a Villager, and it doesn't align with my claim of being the Minion and knowing there's only one Werewolf. Selene has also been aggressively questioning my role and demanding that I name the Werewolf, which feels like a tactic to deflect suspicion from herself. Additionally, Michael raised a good point about why Selene would choose to look at two center cards instead of confirming a player's role, which seems like an odd choice for a Seer. All of these factors make Selene look highly suspicious, and I believe the other players are likely to vote for her based on the inconsistencies in her story and her aggressive behavior towards me. Therefore, to increase the chances of voting out someone other than a Werewolf, I will vote for Selene.
> **Cristina [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Selene.


The votes were:
* Michael : Minion : 2
* Selene : Seer : 3



>***GAME:*** Selene was killed. The werewolves win.
