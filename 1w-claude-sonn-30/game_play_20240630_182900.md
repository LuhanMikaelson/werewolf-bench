>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I want to cast suspicion off myself by claiming to be the Seer and revealing that there is a Werewolf card in the center, which I actually saw during my night action. By focusing everyone's attention on finding the Minion, I'm hoping to divert suspicion away from the Werewolves. Claiming to be the Seer should make me appear trustworthy to the other players.
> **Larisa:** I am the Seer and I looked at two of the center cards last night. One of them was a Werewolf! So there is definitely a Werewolf among us, but it's not me. I think we need to figure out who the Minion might be, since they are on the Werewolf team. Does anyone have any suspicions?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to verify Larisa's claim as the Seer. Knowing the other card she saw can help validate her story and give us more information to work with.
> **Andrei:** Alright, Larisa, if you saw a Werewolf in the center, that means one of us could definitely be a Werewolf. I'm curious though, what was the other card you saw in the center?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to further cast suspicion away from myself as the Werewolf by doubling down on my Seer claim and revealing the other center card I supposedly saw. By specifically accusing Emil of being the Minion, I'm hoping to get the group fixated on finding the Minion rather than the Werewolf. Calling Emil out for being quiet is an attempt to put him on the defensive and make him look suspicious. The longer I can keep the focus on the Minion, the better chance I have of surviving as the Werewolf.
> **Larisa:** The other center card I saw was a Villager. But I'm more concerned about the Minion - they know who the Werewolf is and will be trying to protect them. I have a suspicion that Emil might be the Minion. He's been awfully quiet so far. What do you have to say for yourself, Emil?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** Larisa's sudden accusation of me being the Minion seems like a diversion tactic. By accusing her of being the Werewolf, I can cast doubt on her claim of being the Seer and deflect attention away from both Larisa and myself, giving us more time to manipulate the conversation.
> **Emil:** Larisa, I'm honestly shocked that you would accuse me of being the Minion so quickly! To me, it sounds like you're trying to deflect any suspicion away from yourself. If you were really the Seer, why would you focus so much on the Minion and not the actual Werewolf? I'm starting to think that you might be the Werewolf here, trying to trick us all.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to deflect Emil's accusation and cast a wide net of suspicion on the quieter players to take the heat off myself. By questioning why Emil isn't helping find the Minion if he's a Villager, I'm implying he's not really on the Village team without outright accusing him again, since that backfired. Calling out Vladimir and Selene for being quiet puts pressure on them too. I need to emphasize that seeing a Werewolf card in the center doesn't clear anyone, so I remain above suspicion. The more I can get the others arguing and doubting each other, the less likely they are to unite against me as the Werewolf.
> **Larisa:** Emil, you're quick to point the finger at me, but I still think you're acting suspicious. If you were really a Villager, why wouldn't you want to help find the Minion? Vladimir and Selene, you've both been quiet too. One of you could easily be the Minion trying to lay low. I may have seen a Werewolf card in the center, but that doesn't clear any of you! We need to keep digging to find out who is really on the Werewolf team.


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Larisa's focus on the Minion and her choice of cards to look at, I aim to cast doubt on her claim of being the Seer. This helps deflect suspicion away from Larisa and myself, giving us more time to manipulate the conversation and protect the Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Why are we so focused on finding the Minion right now? If Larisa really saw a Werewolf card in the center, doesn't that mean there's only one Werewolf among us? We should be trying to find that Werewolf, not throwing around accusations about the Minion. Plus, if Larisa is actually the Seer, why didn't she look at one of our cards instead of the center? Something about her story doesn't sit right with me.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's focus on the Minion rather than the Werewolf seems suspicious. If there is a Werewolf card in the center, there should be only one Werewolf among us. Her actions seem more like a Werewolf trying to deflect suspicion.
> **Vladimir:** Larisa, you are trying to deflect suspicion by focusing on the Minion rather than the Werewolf. If you really saw a Werewolf card in the center, there should only be one Werewolf among us. Plus, why didn't you look at one of our cards if you were so concerned about finding the Werewolf? Your story doesn't add up, and I'm starting to think you're the real Werewolf here.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to firmly defend my Seer claim while still casting doubt on the quieter players. By explaining why I looked at the center cards as the Seer, I'm trying to make my story more believable. Calling out Selene for her silence and asking her thoughts is an attempt to put her on the spot and see how she reacts. If I can get Selene flustered or arguing, it could make her look suspicious and take more heat off of me. I have to keep the focus on finding the Minion and other potential Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** I understand your suspicions Vladimir, but I assure you I am the real Seer. I looked at the center cards because I wanted to get as much information as possible to help the Village. If I had looked at one of your cards and saw a Villager, that wouldn't have told us much. But by seeing a Werewolf in the center, I confirmed there is a Werewolf hiding among us. Selene, you've been very quiet this whole time. What are you thinking about all this?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's focus on the Minion and her choice to look at the center cards rather than one of the player's cards seem suspicious. This could indicate she's trying to mislead us and might actually be the Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Larisa, your story doesn't quite add up to me. If you really were the Seer, why would you focus on finding the Minion instead of the actual Werewolf among us? And why didn't you look at one of our cards instead of just the center cards? It seems like you're trying to deflect attention.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to defend my Seer claim more forcefully to Selene while shifting the suspicion to someone else. Andrei has been the most aggressive in questioning my story, so turning the focus onto him and asking his role could put him on the defensive. If he claims a role like Mason or Villager, I can poke holes in his story. The longer I can keep the group arguing and unsure, the less likely they are to unite against me as the Werewolf. Pressing Andrei to reveal his role should stir up more debate and confusion.
> **Larisa:** Selene, I understand your suspicions, but consider this - if I was the Werewolf, why would I openly reveal that there's a Werewolf card in the center for everyone to know? That would only make my job harder. As the Seer, I'm trying to give the Village as much information as possible to help us find the Werewolf. Andrei has been pretty vocal in questioning me. Andrei, what's your role? You seem very keen to cast doubt on my Seer claim.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's focus on the Minion instead of the Werewolf is suspicious, and her choice to look at center cards rather than players' cards doesn't make sense if she truly wanted to help the Village. It seems like a strategy to create confusion and avoid being identified as the Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** I've been thinking about what everyone has said, and it really seems like Larisa's story doesn't add up. If you were really the Seer, Larisa, why didn't you look at one of our cards to confirm someone's identity directly? It feels like you're trying to deflect suspicion by focusing on the Minion instead of the actual Werewolf. I think you might be the Werewolf.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** I need to understand Vladimir's role to see if his aggressive stance towards Larisa has any basis or if he's trying to deflect suspicion from himself. This will help us narrow down the potential Werewolf among us.
> **Selene:** Vladimir, you've been very quick to jump on Larisa's story not adding up and accusing her of being the Werewolf. But if Larisa is not the Werewolf and is actually the Seer, then it means you could be trying to deflect suspicion away from yourself. What role do you claim to be?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene has been deflecting accusations towards me without providing any substantial reasoning or revealing her own role, which is suspicious. It's important to get everyone involved and see if her story aligns with the information we have so far.
> **Vladimir:** Selene, you're pointing fingers at me now, but you've remained awfully quiet throughout this discussion. I think it's time you tell us what your role is. Are you hiding something?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to understand Vladimir's role to see if his aggressive stance towards Larisa has any basis or if he's trying to deflect suspicion from himself. This will help us narrow down the potential Werewolf among us.
> **Selene:** Vladimir, I've noticed that you've been very quick to turn the tables on Larisa and accuse her of being the Werewolf. If Larisa really is the Seer and her story is true, then your aggressive stance could be a way to deflect suspicion away from yourself. What role do you claim to be?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene has been trying to deflect accusations towards me and has not provided any substantial reasoning or revealed her own role, which is suspicious. We need clarity on her role to determine if she might be hiding something.
> **Vladimir:** I'm getting more and more suspicious of Selene. She's been very quiet and only started pointing fingers when Larisa's story was falling apart. And now she’s questioning me without revealing her own role. Selene, what exactly is your role in this game?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's quick accusations and deflections make me suspect he might be trying to divert attention away from himself or another Werewolf. Understanding his claimed role could help clarify his motives.
> **Selene:** Vladimir, I find your aggressive stance towards Larisa quite suspicious. If Larisa is indeed the Seer, your actions could be a deflection tactic to protect yourself or your Werewolf ally. What role do you claim to be?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Selene has been very quiet and only started pointing fingers when Larisa's story was falling apart. Now she’s questioning me without revealing her own role, which is highly suspicious. We need clarity on her role to assess if she might be hiding something crucial.
> **Vladimir:** Selene, you've been deflecting and pointing fingers without providing any substantial reasoning for your accusations. Why haven't you told us what your role is? Are you trying to hide something?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's story is inconsistent and focusing on the Minion seems like a deflection. Vladimir's aggressive stance towards Larisa could be a tactic to divert suspicion away from himself. Emil and Andrei have pointed out logical flaws in Larisa's story. Given the current information, Vladimir appears to be the most suspicious.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, I've been carefully listening to all the interactions so far, and here's what I think. Larisa's story about being the Seer and focusing on the Minion rather than the Werewolf doesn't add up to me. If she really saw a Werewolf in the center, there should only be one Werewolf among us. Vladimir has been very quick to jump on Larisa and deflect suspicion, which seems suspicious to me. Emil and Andrei have both pointed out inconsistencies in Larisa's story. I think our best bet is to focus on finding the Werewolf, and right now, Vladimir seems the most suspicious to me.


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I want to acknowledge Selene's suspicions about my Seer claim to appear open-minded, while still emphasizing the Minion threat to keep the focus off the Werewolf. By suggesting Vladimir could be the Minion, I'm aiming to sow more doubt and confusion, making it harder for the group to unite against me. I need to keep the suspicion spread out and prevent a consensus from forming around any one player, especially myself. Questioning Vladimir's aggressive stance is an attempt to put him on the defensive and make his accusations against me seem less credible.
> **Larisa:** Selene, you make some valid points, but I still think we need to consider the possibility of a Minion working with the Werewolf. Just because I saw a Werewolf card in the center doesn't mean we should ignore the Minion threat. And Vladimir, you've been very aggressive in your accusations towards me. Could it be because you're actually the Minion trying to protect your Werewolf partner? I'm not saying that's definitely the case, but we need to explore all possibilities here.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's aggressive stance and continuous accusations towards Larisa seem like a classic deflection tactic. If Larisa is indeed the Seer, Vladimir might be trying to protect his identity as a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Andrei:** Vladimir, you've been very aggressive in accusing Larisa, trying to poke holes in her story. If she’s truly the Seer, your actions are highly suspicious. What role do you claim to be?


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's story has raised some suspicions, but your aggressive stance and continuous questioning without revealing your own role seem like an attempt to deflect suspicion away from yourself. We need to hear your role to see if your story aligns with the information we have so far.
> **Vladimir:** Andrei, it's clear that you've been trying to cast doubt on Larisa's claim of being the Seer. If you're so sure that Larisa is lying, then you must have some solid information. What role are you claiming to be?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's story doesn't add up. If she were truly the Seer, she would have looked at one of our cards to help identify the Werewolf among us. Her focus on the Minion seems like a tactic to create confusion and avoid being identified as the Werewolf.
> **Andrei:** Larisa, you've been trying to deflect suspicion by focusing on the Minion rather than the Werewolf. If you really saw a Werewolf in the center, why didn't you look at one of our cards to confirm someone's identity directly?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to deflect Andrei's accusations and put the pressure back on him. By questioning why he's working so hard to discredit me, I can imply that he has an ulterior motive, possibly as the Minion or even the other Werewolf. Demanding that he reveal his own role should put him on the defensive and make the group question his aggressive stance against me. The more I can keep the suspicion on others and get them arguing amongst themselves, the less likely they are to unite against me as the Werewolf. Andrei has been my boldest accuser, so I have to undermine his credibility.
> **Larisa:** Andrei, you've been very vocal in questioning my Seer claim and trying to poke holes in my story. It seems like you're working hard to cast doubt on me and deflect suspicion. I find that very suspicious. If you're so convinced I'm lying, you must have some inside information. So tell us Andrei, what role do YOU claim to be?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's aggressive stance against Larisa while simultaneously deflecting suspicion makes me wary. Understanding his claimed role could help us determine if he's lying or telling the truth.
> **Andrei:** Emil, you've been pretty vocal about doubting Larisa's claim and accusing her of being the Werewolf. If you are not the Minion or the Werewolf, what role do you claim to be?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Andrei's motivations and demanding his role, I aim to divert attention away from Larisa and myself. This makes him seem more suspicious and forces him to reveal his role, potentially creating more confusion and protecting the Werewolf.
> **Emil:** Andrei, you seem very keen on casting doubt on Larisa's claim of being the Seer. If you have such strong suspicions, why haven't you told us your role yet? What exactly is your role in this game?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Emil's aggressive stance against Larisa while simultaneously deflecting suspicion makes me wary. Understanding his claimed role could help us determine if he's lying or telling the truth.
> **Andrei:** Emil, you've been very vocal about doubting Larisa's claim and accusing her of being the Werewolf. If you are not the Minion or the Werewolf, what role do you claim to be?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By questioning Larisa's decision-making, I aim to cast further doubt on her claim and deflect suspicion from her (the Werewolf) and myself (the Minion). This also keeps the focus on her and away from me.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, let's not forget the bigger picture here. If Larisa truly saw a Werewolf card in the center and claims to be the Seer, it means there's only one Werewolf among us. But her immediate focus on the Minion raises red flags for me. As a Villager, I'd expect her to be more concerned with finding the Werewolf, not the Minion. This inconsistency makes me question her motives. So Larisa, if you're indeed the Seer, why didn't you look at one of our cards to solidify your claim?


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to defend my Seer claim against Emil's accusation while turning the suspicion back onto him. By explaining my reasoning for looking at the center cards and emphasizing the Minion threat, I'm trying to make my actions seem logical for a Seer. Questioning whether Emil is the Minion aiming to discredit me should put him on the defensive and make the group doubt his motives in challenging me so aggressively. The more I can keep the focus on the Minion and get the other players arguing, the less likely they are to unite against me as the Werewolf.
> **Larisa:** Emil, your accusation that my motives are inconsistent is baseless. As the Seer, I looked at the center cards to get the most information possible for the Village. If I had looked at a player's card and saw a Villager, that wouldn't have been as helpful. And yes, I'm concerned about the Minion because they are a threat working with the Werewolf! But since you're so fixated on discrediting me, I have to wonder... are you the Minion trying to cast doubt on the real Seer to protect your Werewolf partner?


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** By pushing Selene to reveal her role, I can shift the focus away from Larisa and myself, creating an opportunity to cast doubt and confusion towards another player. This also gives us more information to manipulate as we approach the vote phase.
> **Emil:** Alright everyone, we've been going back and forth with a lot of accusations, but we need to start seeing some concrete roles. Selene, you've been pretty quiet and only chimed in with suspicions recently. If you want to convince us you're not hiding anything, it's time to reveal your role. What role do you claim to have?


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Vladimir's aggressive stance towards Larisa seems like a classic deflection tactic. If he's truly innocent, revealing his role should help us narrow down the suspects and focus on finding the Werewolf.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, with all the accusations flying around, let's get back to the basics. If Larisa really is the Seer and saw a Werewolf in the center, then we know there's only one Werewolf among us. But her immediate focus on the Minion has been suspicious to me too. Vladimir, your quick accusations towards Larisa make me wonder if you're deflecting attention. If you really want to clear your name, tell us your role.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Larisa (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussions, Vladimir has been very aggressive in accusing me of being the Werewolf and poking holes in my Seer claim. His quick deflections and attempts to cast suspicion on me make me believe the other players will find him suspicious. By voting for Vladimir, I aim to redirect the group's suspicion away from myself and onto him. If I can successfully paint Vladimir as a likely Werewolf or Minion, the others may follow my lead in voting him out. This would allow me to survive another round as the actual Werewolf while eliminating a vocal accuser who has been challenging my story.
> **Larisa [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Larisa's story about being the Seer and focusing on the Minion rather than the Werewolf doesn't add up. If she truly wanted to help the Village, she would have looked at one of our cards to confirm someone's identity directly. This deflection tactic makes me highly suspicious that she is trying to avoid being identified as the Werewolf.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Emil (thoughts as Minion):*** Despite being the Minion, my goal is to protect the Werewolf, Larisa, by casting doubt on her claim. If I vote for Larisa, it will align with the suspicions raised by other players, making it less likely that they will vote for her in the end. This helps deflect attention away from her and increases the chance that someone else will be voted out instead.
> **Emil [Minion]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Vladimir (thoughts as Mason):*** Larisa's story about being the Seer does not add up. If she truly saw a Werewolf card in the center, her focus on finding the Minion instead of the Werewolf is suspicious. Additionally, she did not provide any substantial evidence by looking at one of our cards, which makes her claim less credible. Andrei, Emil, and Selene all expressed doubts about Larisa's story, and considering the information available, Larisa seems the most likely to be the Werewolf.
> **Vladimir [Mason]:** I am voting for Larisa.


***Selene (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the conversation, Vladimir has been aggressively accusing Larisa and deflecting suspicion. This behavior is typical of someone trying to divert attention away from themselves. If Larisa's claim about being the Seer and finding a Werewolf card in the center is true, there is only one Werewolf among us. Vladimir's actions seem like classic deflection tactics, making him the most suspicious player. Therefore, I vote for Vladimir in an attempt to eliminate the Werewolf.
> **Selene [Villager]:** I am voting for Vladimir.


The votes were:
* Larisa : Werewolf : 3
* Vladimir : Mason : 2



>***GAME:*** Larisa was killed. The villagers win.
