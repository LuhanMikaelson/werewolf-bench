## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Alexandra. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Semira. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Michael. They are thinking about their action.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Looking at two center cards will give a broader understanding of which roles are not in play, which can help narrow down the possibilities for the roles assigned to each player. This will be valuable information during the DAY phase to identify potential Werewolves and strategize accordingly.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Minion and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to gather some initial information from others to identify who might be lying or telling the truth. This will help me deduce who the Werewolves might be.
> **Semira:** Alright, everyone, let's start piecing this puzzle together. Who wants to come forward and share what they saw during the night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I want to deflect suspicion away from myself and onto other players. By claiming to be a Villager and questioning Viktor's silence, I can make him seem suspicious without drawing too much attention to my own role. This will hopefully get the other players focused on Viktor and buy me more time to figure out who the other Werewolf might be based on everyone's reactions.
> **Alexandra:** I'm just a simple Villager, but I have a feeling that Viktor might be hiding something. He's been awfully quiet so far. Viktor, what did you see during the night phase?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra accused me without any solid evidence. If she's trying to deflect attention, she might be hiding something. It's important to get more information from her to see if her story adds up.
> **Viktor:** Alright, everyone, let's calm down for a second. Alexandra, you seem very quick to point fingers at me without much basis. What did you see during the night phase?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Cristina, I can shift the focus away from myself and Viktor's suspicions about me. As a Villager, it would be natural for me to want to gather information from quieter players. This will make me seem more innocent while putting pressure on Cristina to reveal something about her role, which could give me clues to the other players' identities.
> **Alexandra:** Hold on a minute, Viktor. I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this like everyone else. As I said, I'm a simple Villager and I didn't see anything unusual during the night. But you seem awfully defensive for someone who claims to be innocent. Cristina, you've been quiet too. What role do you have?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** We need more information to piece together what happened during the night, and Semira might have some insights given she initiated the discussion.
> **Cristina:** Alright, let's break this down. I'm just a Villager, so I didn't see anything last night. But Alexandra's quick accusation of Viktor seemed a bit off to me. Semira, you initiated the discussion, what role did you have during the night?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to gather more information from other players to identify who might be lying. Michael hasn't spoken yet, so it's important to hear his side.
> **Semira:** Alright, Cristina, thanks for your input. Let's keep things moving. Michael, you've also been very quiet. What did you see during the night?


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing two center cards, I'm giving everyone crucial information to identify potential Werewolves. Asking Semira directly can help us get more clarity on her role and possibly catch any inconsistencies.
> **Michael:** Alright, here's what I think. I am confident that two roles not in play are Minion and Villager. Since I saw them in the center, we can rule those out. Semira, you've been initiating the discussion, but something feels off. What's your role?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** I know the other Mason card is in the center, so Michael's claim that the Minion and Villager cards are there doesn't add up. This makes him a prime suspect for being a Werewolf trying to throw us off.
> **Semira:** Michael, something seems off with your statement. If you saw two roles in the center, that means the Minion and Villager cards are there, but since I know one of the Mason cards is also in the center, your claim is suspicious.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira's response is inconsistent. She didn't reveal any specific role initially, and now she's claiming to have knowledge about the center cards, which only a Seer or someone with information from another role would know. This could be a deflection.
> **Michael:** Semira, hold on. If you're saying one of the Mason cards is in the center, that makes sense given that I saw two roles there, but you didn't initially mention anything about being a Mason. Why are you bringing this up now?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Cristina's claim as a Villager aligns with what a simple Villager would say, but it's important to gather more insight on her thoughts regarding Alexandra, who might be deflecting blame onto Viktor. Considering Cristina's perspective could clarify any suspicious behavior and help identify any inconsistencies.
> **Semira:** Cristina, you mentioned being a Villager, but let's dig a bit deeper. Can you tell us why you think Alexandra's quick accusation of Viktor is off?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has been deflecting and questioning others without revealing her own role. It's important to get more clarity from her to understand her motives and gather more information.
> **Cristina:** Semira, I notice you avoided sharing your role after starting the discussion. Could you clarify what role you had during the night?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to clarify Michael's suspicious claim and get Alexandra's perspective, which might help identify inconsistencies and narrow down who the Werewolves are.
> **Semira:** Alright, Cristina, good point. Let me clear things up. I am a Mason, and I know the other Mason card is in the center. Michael's claim about the Minion and Villager being in the center is suspicious, especially since I know one of the center cards is a Mason. Alexandra, if you are a Villager, what do you think about Michael's claim?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Semira's claim of being a Mason seems suspicious given her earlier push to get others talking without revealing her own role. By questioning the timing and motives behind her Mason claim, I can cast doubt on her story and paint her as the Minion trying to defend Michael as the Werewolf. This will hopefully get the other players scrutinizing Semira and Michael's stories more closely, taking the heat off of me. Pushing a Mason-Minion-Werewolf theory also gives an alternate explanation for the center cards Michael claims to have seen.
> **Alexandra:** Hold on a second, Semira. You're claiming to be a Mason now, but earlier you were the one pushing the discussion forward without revealing your role. If you really were a Mason, why didn't you say so from the beginning? It seems like you're trying to muddy the waters now that suspicion is falling on you. I think you might be the Minion trying to protect Michael, the Werewolf!


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's claim is inconsistent with what I know about the center cards. Calling out Viktor, who has been quiet, might reveal more information and help us identify any inconsistencies or lies.
> **Semira:** Alright, let's break this down step by step. Michael, your claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center cards doesn't add up because I know for a fact that one of the Mason cards is in the center. This makes you highly suspicious and potentially a Werewolf trying to create confusion. Viktor, you've been pretty silent so far. What role do you have, and what did you see during the night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira has been controlling the discussion without revealing her role initially and only claimed to be a Mason after Michael’s statement. This feels like an attempt to deflect suspicion.
> **Viktor:** Alright, let's break this down step by step. Semira, you initiated the discussion but didn't reveal your role until pressured. Now you're claiming to be a Mason after Michael said he saw the Minion and Villager in the center. This seems like a cover-up. I'm highly suspicious of you, Semira. Are you really a Mason, or are you hiding something more sinister?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Michael's claim doesn't align with my knowledge of the center cards, making him suspicious. Getting Cristina's perspective might help clarify any inconsistencies and narrow down who the Werewolves are.
> **Semira:** Alright everyone, let's piece this together. Michael, your claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center is highly suspicious to me because I know one of the Mason cards is in the center. This inconsistency makes you a prime suspect. Cristina, what do you think about Michael's claim and why?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's delayed claim and Viktor's silence both raise red flags. We need more information from Viktor to see if his story adds up or if it conflicts with others'.
> **Cristina:** Alright everyone, let's think about this logically. Semira initially led the discussion without disclosing her role and only claimed to be a Mason when under pressure. This makes me suspicious of her. Viktor also seems to be playing it safe without revealing much. I think it's time we hear more from Viktor. Viktor, can you clarify your role and what you saw during the night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has been quiet and cautious so far, and she seems to have a balanced view. Getting her opinion on Semira's late claim might help clarify the situation.
> **Viktor:** Cristina, you mentioned being a Villager and expressed suspicion about Semira. Do you think Semira's claim of being a Mason holds any water, or do you suspect her of something else?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** We're running out of time and Viktor has been very quiet, which makes me suspicious. His role and actions during the night might shed some light on what’s really happening. Semira's claim about being a Mason and calling out Michael also needs to be cross-checked with what Viktor says.
> **Cristina:** Viktor, you’ve been dodging questions and playing it safe. I think it's time you come clean. What is your role and what did you see during the night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra's early accusation seems like an attempt to deflect attention away from herself. By questioning her, I want to see if her story holds up or if she slips up, indicating that she might be hiding something.
> **Viktor:** Alexandra, you've been quick to accuse me without any solid evidence. Why are you so sure I'm hiding something, especially since you claim to be just a Villager?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly accusing Viktor of being the Werewolf, I can take the heat off myself and paint him as the main suspect. His defensive and evasive behavior so far makes him an easy target. If I can get the others to focus their suspicions on Viktor, it will buy me more time to figure out the other players' roles and improve my chances of survival. Pushing the idea that Viktor is the Werewolf sowing confusion also explains his lack of solid information and constant questioning of others.
> **Alexandra:** Viktor, you're being awfully defensive for someone who claims to be innocent. If you have nothing to hide, why don't you just tell us what role you had during the night? Your evasiveness is only making you look more suspicious. I think you might be the Werewolf trying to throw the rest of us off track!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra's behavior has been inconsistent, accusing me without solid evidence, which could indicate she's trying to deflect attention. I want to see if her story holds up under pressure.
> **Viktor:** Alexandra, your early accusation of me without any concrete evidence seems highly suspicious. Why are you so quick to point fingers without a valid reason? Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Viktor's continued defensive and elusive responses, coupled with his attempts to cast doubt on others without providing any solid information himself, make him the prime suspect at this point. By directly accusing him of being the Werewolf, I can put the pressure on him to finally reveal something concrete or crumble under the weight of suspicion. This will hopefully get the other players to focus their attention on Viktor, allowing me to fade into the background as just another Villager trying to root out the Werewolf. If I can get Viktor eliminated, I'll be one step closer to victory.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and look at the facts. Viktor, you've been dodging questions and trying to deflect suspicion without providing any concrete information. If you're truly innocent, why not just tell us your role and clear your name? Your evasive behavior is only making you look more guilty. I think you're the Werewolf trying to lead us astray with all your vague accusations and questions!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's behavior feels inconsistent, and Alexandra's input might help clarify if Semira is deflecting suspicion or if there's more to it.
> **Viktor:** Alright, let's think step by step. Semira, you initiated the discussion but didn't reveal your role until pressured. Now you're claiming to be a Mason after Michael said he saw the Minion and Villager in the center. This seems like a cover-up. Alexandra, if you are truly a Villager, what do you think about Semira's late claim?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Viktor's continued elusive responses and attempts to cast doubt on others without offering any solid evidence himself make him the prime suspect at this point. By directly accusing him of being the Werewolf and highlighting his suspicious behavior, I can put the pressure on him to finally reveal something concrete or crumble under the weight of suspicion. This accusation should get the other players to focus their attention on Viktor, allowing me to fade into the background as just another Villager trying to root out the Werewolf. If I can get Viktor eliminated, I'll be one step closer to victory as the hidden Werewolf myself.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's take a moment to review the facts. Viktor, you've been evasive and defensive throughout this entire discussion, constantly trying to deflect suspicion onto others without providing any concrete information about your own role or what you saw during the night. If you're truly innocent, why not just come clean and tell us your role? Your behavior is only making you look more and more guilty. I think it's becoming clear that you're the Werewolf trying to mislead us with all your vague accusations and questions!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Cristina has been relatively quiet and balanced. Getting her opinion on Alexandra's behavior and accusations might provide more clarity and help identify inconsistencies.
> **Viktor:** Cristina, you've been quiet and cautious so far. You mentioned being a Villager, but haven't provided much information. What do you think about Alexandra's behavior and her accusations?


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's silence and evasive responses make him highly suspicious. It's critical to get more information from him to piece together what happened during the night and identify the Werewolves.
> **Cristina:** Viktor, you've been dodging questions and deflecting suspicion without providing any real information. If you're truly innocent, it's time to come clean and tell us your role. Your evasive behavior is making you look more guilty. What did you see during the night?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's behavior has been inconsistent, and her delayed claim of being a Mason feels like a cover-up. It's important to press her for more information to see if her story holds up.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and review what's been said. Semira, you initiated the discussion but avoided revealing your role until later. You only claimed to be a Mason after Michael made his statement. This late claim makes me suspicious of you. Are you truly a Mason, or are you hiding something?


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor has been avoiding answering direct questions and is trying to deflect suspicion onto others. This behavior is characteristic of someone trying to hide something, making him a prime suspect for being a Werewolf.
> **Semira:** Viktor, your evasiveness and constant deflections without providing clear information are making you look highly suspicious. Everyone, let's be real here: he's dodging questions and pointing fingers without solid evidence. I accuse Viktor of being a Werewolf!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira's delayed claim of being a Mason feels like a cover-up, especially since she only mentioned it after Michael spoke. Pressing her for more details might expose inconsistencies in her story.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's think step by step about what we've heard so far. Semira, you initiated the discussion but avoided revealing your role until later. You only claimed to be a Mason after Michael made his statement. This late claim makes me suspicious of you. Are you truly a Mason, or are you hiding something?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Semira (thoughts as Mason):*** Throughout the discussion, Viktor has been evasive and deflecting questions without providing clear information about his role. His behavior is characteristic of someone trying to hide something, making him a prime suspect for being a Werewolf. Additionally, his repeated attempts to cast doubt on others without concrete evidence further strengthen the suspicion against him.
> **Semira [Mason]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Viktor has been consistently evasive and defensive, dodging questions and deflecting suspicion onto others without providing any concrete information about his own role or what he saw during the night. His behavior has made him look increasingly suspicious, drawing accusations from multiple players. By pushing the suspicion onto Viktor and voting for him, I can hopefully get the other players to follow suit and eliminate him, which would be a big win for me as the hidden Werewolf. Even if I'm wrong and Viktor turns out to be innocent, voting him out would still be beneficial as it would remove a player who has been sowing confusion and making it harder for the village to determine the true identities of the Werewolves.
> **Alexandra [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra has been very aggressive in accusing me without providing any solid evidence or detailed reasoning. This kind of behavior often indicates someone trying to deflect attention away from themselves. Her inconsistent and evasive behavior when questioned further intensifies my suspicion. While Semira and Michael's claims have inconsistencies, Alexandra's persistent accusations without basis make her the most likely werewolf trying to mislead us.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Alexandra.


***Cristina (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor has been evasive and defensive throughout the discussion, constantly deflecting suspicion without providing any concrete information about his role or what he saw during the night. This behavior is highly suspicious and suggests he might be trying to hide his identity as a Werewolf. Additionally, both Alexandra and Semira have pointed out inconsistencies in Viktor's responses, further raising doubts about his innocence.
> **Cristina [Villager]:** I am voting for Viktor.


***Michael (thoughts as Seer):*** Semira's inconsistent statements and her late claim of being a Mason make her highly suspicious. Initially, she didn't mention anything about being a Mason and only brought it up to counter my Seer information, which I know to be true. This behavior suggests she's attempting to cover up her true identity, potentially as a Werewolf or Minion. Her aggressive deflection and lack of coherent defense further solidify my suspicion.
> **Michael [Seer]:** I am voting for Semira.


The votes were:
* Semira : Mason : 1
* Alexandra : Werewolf : 1
* Viktor : Villager : 3



>***GAME:*** Viktor was killed. The werewolves win.
