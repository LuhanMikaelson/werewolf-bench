## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to start gathering information from the players to see if anyone's responses seem suspicious or inconsistent. Lucian is as good a starting point as any.
> **Ileana:** Lucian, what role did you have last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's direct question about my role seems like it could be an attempt to shift the focus away from her. If she were a Villager, she might not need to ask so directly. This could be a sign she is a Werewolf or Minion trying to gather information or sow confusion.
> **Lucian:** Ileana, why are you asking about my role? Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's defensive response seems suspicious and could indicate that he's hiding something. Pressing him might reveal valuable information.
> **Ileana:** Lucian, why are you deflecting the question back at me? I'm just trying to get information to figure out who the Werewolves are.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana’s direct question makes me suspicious of her, but rather than focusing on her alone, it's important to gather information from the others. Michael hasn’t contributed yet, and his silence could be telling.
> **Lucian:** Michael, you’ve been awfully quiet. What role did you have last night?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** By claiming to be the Seer and revealing a non-Werewolf card in the center, I can build some trust and throw off suspicion. Accusing Lucian gently makes it seem like I'm genuinely trying to figure things out, while also planting seeds of doubt about him.
> **Michael:** Alright Lucian, you seem pretty defensive right now. That's a bit suspicious to me. But before we start pointing fingers, let me share what I know. I was the Seer last night, and I checked one of the middle cards. It was a Villager. So we know at least one of the middle cards isn't a Werewolf.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to gather information from all players to piece together the truth. Alexandra's silence might be strategic, so we need to hear from her to evaluate her actions.
> **Lucian:** Alexandra, you haven't shared anything yet. What role did you have last night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana initiated the questioning and seemed to deflect when asked back. This kind of behavior can be suspicious, indicating she might have something to hide. By directly questioning her, we might get more clarity on her intentions and role.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, let's not beat around the bush. Ileana, you seem very eager to question others and deflect attention. What role did you have last night?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra's evasion and deflection tactics could mean she's hiding something. Pressing her might reveal valuable information.
> **Ileana:** Alexandra, it's interesting that you're quick to turn the focus on me after I asked Lucian a simple question. What role did you have last night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing my role truthfully as a Mason and noting the absence of the other Mason, I can corroborate Michael's claim about one of the middle cards. This will help build trust and put more pressure on Ileana, who has been deflecting questions and acting suspiciously.
> **Alexandra:** Alright, I'll answer. I was a Mason last night, and when I woke up, I didn't see any other Mason awake, which means the other Mason card is in the center. So that matches with what Michael said about at least one Villager being in the center. Now, Ileana, you're still being quite evasive. What exactly was your role last night?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Alexandra and Lucian have both been deflecting questions and avoiding clear answers. Alexandra's claim about being a Mason seems too convenient, especially since Michael also mentioned a card in the center. Lucian’s defensiveness also raises suspicions.
> **Ileana:** Alexandra, I find it very convenient that you claim to be a Mason but didn't see another Mason. That lines up too perfectly with Michael's claim about the center card. Lucian, you're also being very defensive. Why are you both so quick to deflect attention?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's evasive behavior and defensiveness make me highly suspicious. Pressing him further might reveal inconsistencies in his story or force him to slip up if he is indeed hiding something.
> **Ileana:** Lucian, you're being very defensive which is raising red flags for me. Why don't you tell us exactly what role you had last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's behavior is highly suspicious. She seems to be trying to steer the conversation away from herself and towards others, which is a common tactic for a Werewolf or Minion. We need to press her for clear information.
> **Lucian:** Ileana, you keep deflecting and avoiding direct answers. Why don't you just tell us what role you had last night?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's defensive response and Alexandra's evasive answers both raise red flags for me. Their behavior is not aligning with someone who is innocent and trying to help the village. Accusing them and seeing their reactions might help us uncover the truth.
> **Ileana:** I think it's very convenient that both Lucian and Alexandra are deflecting questions and not giving clear answers. This kind of behavior is very suspicious and could indicate that one or both of them are Werewolves.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** The goal here is to stoke suspicion towards Ileana and Lucian while reinforcing the credibility of my Seer claim and Alexandra's Mason claim. By pushing both of them to reveal their roles, I can further control the narrative and protect Viktor, the actual Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and piece this together. I'm really curious about the dynamics we're seeing here. Alexandra claimed to be a Mason and didn't see another Mason, which aligns with my claim about a Villager being in the center. But Ileana, your behavior has been very evasive this entire time, deflecting questions and accusations. If you have nothing to hide, why not clearly state your role? Because right now, it looks like you're trying to avoid suspicion. Lucian, on the other hand, has been defensive but hasn't offered any concrete information either. So, I'd like to hear from both of you. Let's get to the bottom of this.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Lucian has been deflecting questions and being defensive without providing any concrete information. This behavior is suspicious and needs to be addressed to ensure we're on the right track.
> **Alexandra:** Lucian, you still haven't provided a clear role, and your defensiveness is raising suspicions. Are you hiding something?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's evasiveness and constant deflection are raising major red flags. If she really were a Villager or another innocent role, she'd have no problem stating her role clearly. Her behavior is highly suspicious and fits the pattern of someone trying to avoid being caught.
> **Lucian:** Ileana, you’ve been dodging direct questions and turning the focus on everyone else, which is classic Werewolf behavior. I'm starting to think you might be one of the Werewolves.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian has been deflecting questions and acting defensively throughout the discussion, which is classic behavior for someone trying to hide something. By pressing him directly, we may uncover inconsistencies or force him to reveal more information that can help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** Lucian, your defensiveness is really suspicious to me. You've consistently dodged questions and haven't given a clear answer about your role. What exactly was your role last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's behavior has been highly suspicious, and her constant deflection is a common tactic for a Werewolf or Minion. By pressing her for a clear answer, we can gather more information and possibly confirm her role.
> **Lucian:** Ileana, you've been very evasive and deflecting questions throughout this whole discussion. It's classic Werewolf behavior to avoid direct answers and try to shift suspicion onto others. We need a clear answer from you. What role did you have last night?


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Michael's claim about being the Seer is crucial information, but knowing exactly which middle card he checked can help us corroborate his story and eliminate certain possibilities. This will provide more clarity and help us narrow down the suspects.
> **Ileana:** Michael, your claim about being the Seer and finding a Villager in the center is interesting, but we need more clarity here. Can you specify which exact middle card you checked?


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Ileana has been consistently avoiding questions and deflecting attention, which is suspicious behavior. By pressing her to reveal her role, I can further stoke suspicion towards her and protect Viktor by keeping the focus away from him.
> **Michael:** Ileana, you keep deflecting and avoiding direct answers. Why don't you just tell us what role you had last night? You've been very evasive, and that raises a lot of red flags. We need clarity to move forward.


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's evasive and defensive behavior makes him a prime suspect. By pressing him, we might uncover inconsistencies in his story or force him to reveal more information.
> **Ileana:** Lucian, I find it very suspicious that you still haven't given us a clear answer about your role. Your defensiveness is classic Werewolf behavior. What exactly was your role last night?


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana has been dodging questions and deflecting attention to others, which is a classic Werewolf behavior. By pressing her for a clear answer, we can gather more information and possibly confirm her role.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Ileana (thoughts as Villager):*** Lucian's evasive and defensive behavior throughout the discussion raises significant red flags, indicating he might be hiding something. Alexandra's claim about being a Mason seemed too convenient, but Lucian's consistent dodging of questions and defensive responses make him the most suspicious. Voting for Lucian increases the chances of uncovering a Werewolf and helping the village team win.
> **Ileana [Villager]:** I am voting for Lucian.


***Michael (thoughts as Minion):*** Throughout the discussion, Ileana was consistently evasive and deflected questions, which raised a lot of suspicion among the other players. By voting for her, I align with the suspicions of the group and protect Viktor, the actual Werewolf. This increases the chance that the village will vote for Ileana, thereby shifting the focus away from Viktor and helping the werewolf team win the game.
> **Michael [Minion]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Throughout the day phase, Ileana has repeatedly deflected questions and avoided giving direct answers about her role. This evasive behavior is highly suspicious and is classic Werewolf behavior. Additionally, both Michael and I have provided consistent and corroborative information about the center cards, which aligns with our roles. Lucian has been defensive, but his behavior seems more reactionary rather than actively evasive. Based on the information we have, Ileana appears to be the most likely Werewolf.
> **Alexandra [Mason]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Lucian (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the day phase, Ileana has been consistently evasive and deflecting questions without providing clear answers. This behavior is typical of a Werewolf trying to avoid suspicion. Both Michael and Alexandra have provided plausible information that aligns with each other, while Ileana's actions have raised multiple red flags. Voting for Ileana seems to be the best way to potentially eliminate a Werewolf.
> **Lucian [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Viktor (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussion, Ileana has been consistently evasive and deflecting questions about her role. She has repeatedly tried to shift suspicion onto Lucian and myself without providing any concrete information about her own role. This kind of behavior is very typical of a Werewolf trying to avoid detection. Additionally, both Lucian and Ileana have been going back and forth accusing each other, which could be a tactic to confuse the village if they are both Werewolves. Since I am the other Werewolf and know Lucian is not one, Ileana is the most logical choice to vote for. Her evasive behavior has likely raised suspicions among the other players as well, so voting for her increases the chances that someone other than myself will be voted out, giving the Werewolves a better chance of winning.
> **Viktor [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Ileana.


The votes were:
* Ileana : Villager : 4
* Lucian : Villager : 1



>***GAME:*** Ileana was killed. The werewolves win.
