## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Michael. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There are two masons in play, Alexandra and Ileana. They are both now aware of each other.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Dracula. They are thinking about their action.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather information about the roles that are not in play, which will help narrow down the possibilities of who the Werewolves might be. This information can be shared during the day phase to build a strong case and guide the village team's strategy.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Minion


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Confirming the Masons early can help narrow down potential Werewolves and strengthen the village team. If we can verify them, we can trust their information to make better decisions.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, let's start by figuring out who our Masons and Seers are. If you are a Mason, could you please reveal yourself and confirm if you saw the other Mason?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By encouraging the Masons to reveal themselves, I can gain valuable information without drawing suspicion to myself. If both Masons are among the players, that clears two people as not being Werewolves. If a Mason card is in the center, that also helps me deduce things as the hidden Werewolf. Focusing attention on the Masons takes the heat off of me early in the game while I gather intel.
> **Michael:** I'm just a simple Villager, but I think it's important we identify the Masons early on. If they saw each other, that clears two players right away. And if they didn't see each other, then we know a Mason card is in the center, which helps narrow things down too. So any Masons, please speak up!


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing this information, I can help narrow down the roles that are still in play. Since we know the Minion is not in play, we can focus on identifying the Werewolves and other important roles.
> **Dracula:** I've got some crucial information to share. I looked at two of the center cards last night and I can confirm that one of them was a Villager and the other was the Minion.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Revealing that I know Ileana is a Mason helps to build trust and clear two villagers. Questioning Dracula's choice to look at the center cards can reveal more about his intentions and potentially expose inconsistencies in his story.
> **Alexandra:** Ileana, I know you're a Mason because I saw you last night. Everyone, we Masons can be trusted. Now, let's focus on finding the real threats. Dracula, you mentioned seeing a Villager and Minion in the center. If that's true, then the Minion isn't in play among us. But I'm curious, why did you choose to look at the center instead of another player's card?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By verifying the Mason claims, we can either clear two players as trustworthy or expose potential deceit, which will guide our strategy in identifying the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Alexandra, you claimed to be a Mason and vouched for Ileana. This is interesting because if you're lying, it could throw us off completely. Ileana, do you confirm Alexandra's claim that you are indeed a Mason?


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** Confirming the Mason claim strengthens the village's position. Dracula's reasoning for looking at the center cards rather than another player's card needs to be scrutinized, as it might give us a clue about his true role.
> **Ileana:** Yes, I can confirm Alexandra's claim. We are both Masons, and that means we are on the Village team. Now, let's focus on identifying the Werewolves. Dracula, you claimed to have seen a Villager and a Minion in the center. Can you tell us why you prioritized looking at the center cards instead of a player's card? This is crucial information.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Michael's role could easily be claimed by any player, it's important to challenge his claim and seek more information. Werewolves often disguise themselves as Villagers due to the role's simplicity and lack of night actions. By questioning him, we might reveal inconsistencies or gather supporting information that helps us pinpoint the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Michael, you claimed to be a simple Villager. Can you provide any additional information about why you believe that role is credible for you? It's crucial we scrutinize every claim closely.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By casting doubt on Dracula's claim and suggesting they may be the Werewolf, I can shift suspicion away from myself. If I can get the other players to question Dracula's motives for claiming to have seen the Minion, it will make them seem less credible. This deception tactic of counter-accusing someone who made a bold claim can be effective for sowing confusion and mistrust, giving me more room to maneuver as the hidden Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Dracula, your claim of seeing the Minion card in the center is very concerning. If the Minion is truly not in play, that means there's a high probability that you are the Werewolf trying to deceive us. Why else would you make such a bold claim about the center cards? I think we need to seriously consider that Dracula may be lying to protect their Werewolf identity.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By emphasizing Michael’s defensive nature and quick accusation, I aim to highlight behavior that is often indicative of a Werewolf trying to shift suspicion away from themselves. This can help the village team narrow down the potential Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Everyone, I think it's crucial to focus on Michael right now. His reaction to my claim about the center cards was very defensive. If I were lying, I would have been more subtle about it. Michael's quick accusation towards me seems like an attempt to divert attention. This makes me highly suspicious of him.


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's claim to have seen the Minion in the center seems like a convenient way to eliminate suspicion from himself. It's essential to scrutinize his explanation and see if it holds up under questioning.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, your explanation for why you looked at the center cards instead of another player's card doesn't make much sense to me. If you were truly the Seer, wouldn't it be more beneficial to check another player's card to gain more insight into the roles in play? Right now, it feels like you're trying to mislead us. Can you explain your reasoning further?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By putting pressure on Michael, I aim to reveal more about his intentions and possibly expose inconsistencies in his story. His defensive reaction to my earlier statement makes him a prime suspect for being a Werewolf.
> **Dracula:** Michael, I'm still skeptical about your claim of being a simple Villager. Your quick accusation against me felt like a deflection tactic. Can you provide any more evidence to support your claim or offer more insight into the roles at play? Everyone, let's remember that werewolves often try to blend in by claiming to be Villagers.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By further casting doubt on Dracula's suspicious claim and appealing to the confirmed Masons for their input, I can continue to shift the target off of myself as the hidden Werewolf. Dracula's claim about the Minion is a risky play that warrants scrutiny. If I can get the Village team members to doubt his motives, it will sow confusion and mistrust, making it harder for them to unite against the real Werewolf threat. Engaging the Masons also makes me seem like I'm collaborating with confirmed Village team members.
> **Michael:** Dracula, your claim about seeing the Minion in the center is very suspicious. If the Minion was truly in the center, then the Werewolves would have a huge advantage. It feels like you're trying to mislead us and protect the Werewolves. I think we need to seriously consider that Dracula may be a Werewolf himself. Ileana and Alexandra, as confirmed Masons, what do you think about Dracula's claim?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim about seeing the Minion in the center seems suspicious. If the Minion is in the center, the Werewolves have a huge advantage. Dracula's explanation needs further scrutiny to determine if he's lying.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, your reasoning for looking at the center cards instead of another player's card is very unclear. If you were the Seer, wouldn't it have been more beneficial to check another player's card to gain more insight into the roles in play? It feels like you're trying to mislead us.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's reaction was defensive, which is often indicative of someone trying to deflect suspicion. By questioning him directly, we can gather more insight and possibly expose inconsistencies in his story, which will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Michael, your quick accusation towards me feels like a deflection tactic. If you were truly a Villager, you wouldn't be so defensive. Also, we have confirmed Masons here who can vouch for each other. Your reaction makes me highly suspicious of you. Are you hiding something?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's claims about the center cards are extremely suspicious and feel like an attempt to mislead the group and protect the Werewolves. By continuing to cast doubt on his motives and appeal to the other players' sense of reason, I can keep the target on Dracula and off of myself. Aggressively defending against his accusations also makes me look less guilty, as a real Werewolf would likely be more subtle. Directing the group's scrutiny towards Dracula's questionable plays is my best chance at surviving as the hidden Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Dracula, your claims are becoming more and more questionable. First you say you saw the Minion and a Villager in the center, which would give the Werewolves a huge advantage. Now you're trying to cast suspicion on me for defending myself against your accusations. If anyone is acting like a Werewolf here, it's you! I think we need to take a hard look at Dracula's motives.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By seeking Viktor's opinion, I aim to gather more perspectives and place pressure on Michael. Viktor's response could provide additional insights or reveal inconsistencies in Michael's story, which will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Alexandra and Ileana, you both claim to be Masons and have vouched for each other. Given that, I trust your claims. However, Michael's defensive nature and quick accusations towards me are highly suspicious. If I were lying about seeing the Minion in the center, I would have been more subtle. Michael's reaction feels like a classic deflection tactic. Viktor, you haven't said much yet. What's your take on Michael's behavior and his claim of being a simple Villager?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** If Dracula was really the Seer, it would have been more beneficial to check another player's card to help us identify the roles in play. His explanation for looking at the center cards feels like a way to mislead us and protect the Werewolves. We need to scrutinize his actions closely.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, your claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center is very suspicious to me. Why would you choose to look at the center cards instead of another player's card if you were truly the Seer? This doesn't add up.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's reaction to my claim about the center cards was very defensive, which is often indicative of someone trying to deflect suspicion. By questioning him directly, we can gather more insight and possibly expose inconsistencies in his story, which will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Michael, your defensive nature and quick accusations towards me are highly suspicious. If you were truly a Villager, you wouldn't be so defensive. Your reaction feels like a classic deflection tactic. Can you provide any more evidence to support your claim or offer more insight into the roles at play?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's claims about the center cards are extremely dubious and seem like a blatant attempt to deceive the group and shield the Werewolves. By continuing to aggressively question his motives and appeal to the other players' logic, I can keep the heat on Dracula and away from myself. Passionately defending against his accusations also makes me appear less guilty, as a true Werewolf would probably use a more understated approach. Focusing the group's suspicion on Dracula's questionable tactics is my best path to surviving as the hidden Werewolf.
> **Michael:** Dracula, your claims and accusations are becoming more and more outlandish. You say you saw the Minion in the center, which would hugely benefit the Werewolves, and now you're desperately trying to paint me as suspicious for defending myself against your wild theories. If anyone is acting like a Werewolf here, it's you! I think it's time we put Dracula's motives under the microscope and ask why he's working so hard to confuse and mislead this group.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By directing a question to Viktor, who has been relatively quiet, we can gather more information about his role and intentions. His response might reveal inconsistencies or provide additional insights into the roles at play, which will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Viktor, your silence so far has been quite noticeable. You haven't contributed much to the discussion. What role did you have during the night phase, and why haven't you been more involved in our investigation?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** If Dracula was really the Seer, it would have been more beneficial to check another player's card. His explanation for looking at the center cards feels like a way to protect the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, your claim about seeing a Villager and the Minion in the center is highly questionable. If you were truly the Seer, why wouldn't you prioritize checking another player's card to gain better insight? This seems like a tactic to mislead us.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's defensive nature and quick accusations towards me make him highly suspicious. Werewolves often try to blend in by claiming to be Villagers and deflecting suspicion away from themselves. By questioning him directly, we can gather more insight and possibly expose inconsistencies in his story, which will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Michael, your defensive reaction and quick accusation towards me are very suspicious. If you were truly a Villager, you wouldn't be so defensive. Your behavior feels like a classic deflection tactic. Can you provide any more evidence to support your claim or offer more insight into the roles at play?


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's claims and accusations have become increasingly erratic and illogical. By aggressively calling out his contradictions and painting him as the real Werewolf threat, I can turn the group's suspicion away from myself. Passionately arguing against Dracula also makes me look less guilty, as a true Werewolf would likely take a more subtle approach. If I can convince the others that Dracula is lying to protect the Werewolves, they may vote to eliminate him, allowing me to survive. This is a risky play, but casting Dracula as the main villain is my best chance to divert attention from my own deceptions
> **Michael:** Dracula, your accusations and attempts to paint me as the Werewolf are becoming more desperate by the minute. You claim to have seen the Minion and a Villager in the center, which would give the Werewolves a huge advantage, and now you're grasping at straws to make me look guilty. Well, I've had enough of your lies and manipulations! I believe with every fiber of my being that you are the true Werewolf, trying to deceive us all. Your so-called 'seer' claim is full of holes and contradictions. I think it's time we put an end to your trickery and unmask you for the monster you really are!


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** By emphasizing Michael's defensive nature and quick accusations, I aim to highlight behavior indicative of a Werewolf trying to shift suspicion away from themselves. This can help the village team narrow down the potential Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Everyone, I've been paying close attention to the interaction between Michael and myself. His quick accusations and defensive nature have raised multiple red flags. If he were truly a Villager, he wouldn't be so quick to deflect suspicion and accuse me. This feels like classic Werewolf behavior. I urge you all to consider Michael as our prime suspect.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula's claims and accusations have become increasingly erratic and illogical. By aggressively calling out the contradictions in his supposed 'seer' play and painting him as the real Werewolf mastermind, I can deflect the group's growing suspicion away from myself. Passionately arguing against Dracula and poking holes in his story also makes me look less guilty, as a real Werewolf would likely take a more subtle approach. If I can convince the others that Dracula fabricated the Minion claim to deceive and divide us, they may vote to eliminate him, allowing me to survive as the hidden Werewolf. Boldly accusing Dracula is a risky play, but at this point it's my best chance to turn the tables and divert attention from my own deceptions.
> **Michael:** Dracula, your wild accusations and contradictory claims have gone too far. You're trying to paint me as the Werewolf to save your own skin, but your 'seer' story is full of holes. If you really saw the Minion and a Villager in the center, why wouldn't you have looked at a player's card instead to gain more information? Your priority should have been to identify Werewolves among us, not to confirm unplayable roles. I believe you invented this Minion claim to confuse us and protect the real Werewolves. Admit it Dracula, you're the one pulling the strings behind the scenes!


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor's lack of participation could be a tactic to avoid drawing attention. By questioning him directly, we might gain more insight into his role and intentions, which could help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Viktor, your silence is quite noticeable. You haven't contributed much to the discussion. What role did you have during the night phase, and why haven't you been more involved in our investigation?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's actions don't align with how a Seer should act. Looking at another player's card would have provided more valuable information to identify potential Werewolves. His focus on the center cards seems like a distraction tactic.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, your constant accusations and claims are throwing me off. If you were really the Seer, you should have looked at another player's card. Instead, you focused on the center, which raises a lot of suspicion. Why did you make that choice?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Viktor's lack of participation could indicate he is trying to avoid drawing attention, which is typical Werewolf behavior. By questioning him directly, we can gather more information about his role and intentions, potentially exposing inconsistencies that will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Viktor, your silence is suspicious to me. We need more information from you. What role did you have during the night phase, and why did you choose to remain so quiet so far?


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's explanation for looking at the center cards instead of another player's card feels suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, he would have provided more helpful information.
> **Viktor:** Dracula, your claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center doesn't sit right with me. If you were truly the Seer, you would have prioritized checking another player's card to help identify the Werewolves among us. Your choice to look at the center cards seems like a way to mislead us. Can you give us a better explanation for your actions?


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Michael's defensive nature and quick accusations towards me make him highly suspicious. Werewolves often try to blend in by claiming to be Villagers and deflecting suspicion away from themselves. By questioning Viktor directly, we can gather more insight into his role and intentions, potentially exposing inconsistencies that will help us identify the Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Alexandra and Ileana, you both claim to be Masons and have vouched for each other. Given that, I trust your claims.

Michael's reaction feels like a classic deflection tactic. Viktor, you haven't said much yet. What's your take on Michael's behavior and his claim of being a simple Villager?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Viktor (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula's claim of seeing the Minion and Villager in the center is suspicious because it doesn't align with how a Seer should act; a Seer would likely check another player's card for more valuable information. This suggests Dracula might be lying to protect the Werewolves. Additionally, his constant accusations towards Michael and attempts to deflect suspicion raise further doubts about his true role.
> **Viktor [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Michael (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Throughout the discussions, Dracula has made highly suspicious claims and accusations that seem designed to confuse and mislead the group. His supposed 'seer' play of looking at the center cards instead of checking a player's role raises major red flags. If he truly saw the Minion and a Villager, the Werewolves would have a significant advantage. This claim feels fabricated to deceive us and shield the real Werewolves. Additionally, Dracula has been aggressively trying to cast doubt on me by painting my defense as suspicious, which feels like a classic Werewolf deflection tactic. The confirmed Masons, Alexandra and Ileana, haven't countered my arguments against Dracula, which suggests they may also doubt his story. Even Viktor seems skeptical of Dracula's strange choices and explanations. At this point, Dracula appears to be the most likely Werewolf based on his contradictory claims and attempts to sow confusion. Voting him out is the best chance to eliminate a Werewolf and protect the Village team.
> **Michael [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Dracula (thoughts as Seer):*** Throughout the discussion, Michael has been very defensive and quick to accuse me. This behavior is often indicative of a Werewolf trying to deflect suspicion. Additionally, his claim of being a simple Villager is easy to fake and lacks substantial evidence. On the other hand, Alexandra and Ileana have confirmed each other as Masons, which makes them trustworthy. Viktor's silence is also suspicious, but Michael's behavior has raised more red flags. Therefore, I believe Michael is the most likely to be a Werewolf.
> **Dracula [Seer]:** I am voting for Michael.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's claim about seeing the Minion and Villager in the center is highly questionable, especially since it would have been more beneficial for a Seer to look at another player's card. The persistent accusations against Michael seem like an attempt to deflect suspicion away from himself. Ileana and I have confirmed each other as Masons, which means we can be trusted. Michael's defensive nature could be a reaction to being falsely accused. Viktor's minimal contribution doesn't provide enough information, but Dracula's actions and questionable claims make him the most suspicious.
> **Alexandra [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** Dracula's claim of being the Seer and seeing a Villager and Minion in the center feels very suspicious. If he were truly the Seer, it would have been more beneficial for him to look at another player's card to gain more insight. His continuous aggressive accusations towards Michael and his attempt to cast doubt on others without solid reasoning make me believe he is trying to deflect suspicion away from himself. Additionally, both Alexandra and I are confirmed Masons, which leaves Dracula's role as highly suspect. Therefore, I vote for Dracula in an effort to eliminate the potential Werewolf and protect the village.
> **Ileana [Mason]:** I am voting for Dracula.


The votes were:
* Michael : Werewolf : 1
* Dracula : Seer : 4



>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
