## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Ileana. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Villager.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


There are no minions in play.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Selene. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Semira. They are thinking about their action.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can potentially identify two roles that are not in play, which would provide crucial information that can help us deduce the roles of the remaining players more accurately.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Mason and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason, my goal is to assist the villagers in identifying the Werewolves. Knowing the Seer's information could provide us with valuable insights and help us determine who might be lying.
> **Selene:** Alright everyone, let's start figuring things out. I think it's crucial for us to hear from the Seer as soon as possible. If you are the Seer, please share what you saw last night.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** By revealing this information, I can provide clarity on which roles are definitely not in play, which helps us narrow down the possibilities and identify the Werewolves more effectively.
> **Semira:** I am the Seer, and last night I saw two of the center cards. They were a Mason and a Villager. This means those roles are not in play among us.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to gather more information to identify the Werewolves. Dragos has been quiet, so it's important to know if he has any useful information or if he's hiding something.
> **Dracula:** Alright, Semira, thanks for sharing what you saw. Since you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, we know those roles are not in play among us. Let's narrow things down further. Dragos, you haven't said anything yet. Are you one of the special roles, or are you a Villager?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** By confirming the Masons, we can further narrow down the roles in play and identify any potential Werewolves. It’s crucial to verify Semira's claim as the Seer by cross-referencing the information with the Masons.
> **Dragos:** Interesting, Semira. If you saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, that leaves us with a few possible combinations for the remaining roles. We now need to hear from the Masons to confirm their existence in this game.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Since Semira claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, confirming the Masons will help us verify her story. If both Masons are in play, we can trust Semira's information more confidently. If no one claims to be a Mason, we might have to rethink her Seer claim.
> **Dragos:** Alright, we're making some progress. Semira's claim about the center cards is quite specific. If no one else can claim to be the Seer, we should consider her information reliable. The next step is to hear from the potential Masons. If you are a Mason, please speak up now to confirm that both of you exist.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Mason and asking the other Mason to confirm, I can build trust with the group while steering suspicion away from myself. If someone else claims to be the other Mason, great. If not, I can sow doubt and confusion to protect my true werewolf identity. Focusing the discussion on the Mason roles takes attention off of finding the werewolves.
> **Ileana:** I am one of the Masons. Last night, I woke up and saw my fellow Mason. We know each other's identities. If the other Mason could please confirm this, it would help establish trust and narrow down the possibilities for the werewolves.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** I know for a fact that I am the Mason, and the other Mason card is in the center. Since Ileana is claiming to have seen another Mason, it means she is not telling the truth. This makes Ileana suspicious, and potentially a werewolf or the Minion.
> **Selene:** Hold on, Ileana. You claim to be one of the Masons and that you saw the other Mason last night. That's odd because, according to Semira, the Mason card is in the center. This is a direct contradiction. Ileana, you must be lying.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene is raising a valid point about the contradiction between my Mason claim and Semira's supposed Seer info. I need to cast doubt on Semira to maintain my credibility. By suggesting Semira could be mistaken or lying, and raising the possibility of the Minion deceiving me, I'm offering alternative explanations to create confusion and uncertainty. This buys me time and keeps suspicion off me while I figure out my next move. Directing my response to Selene shows I'm addressing her concern directly to appear genuine.
> **Ileana:** Wait a second, Selene. I know it seems contradictory, but hear me out. Is it possible that Semira is mistaken or even lying about what she saw? We can't just take her word for it without questioning. I clearly remember waking up as a Mason and seeing my fellow Mason. If Semira is telling the truth, then the other Mason I saw must have been the Minion trying to deceive me. We need to consider all possibilities here.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** I am the only Mason here, and Semira's claim aligns with my knowledge of the game setup. Ileana's false claim makes her highly suspect, likely a Werewolf or the Minion trying to confuse us.
> **Selene:** I find it very suspicious that Ileana claims to be a Mason and saw another Mason when I know for a fact that the other Mason card is in the center based on Semira's Seer information. Ileana, why are you lying?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Selene is directly accusing me of lying, so I need to address her concern head-on while still maintaining my innocence. By suggesting the possibility of the Minion deceiving me, I'm offering an alternative explanation that sows doubt and buys me time. Framing it as the Werewolves potentially using this to divide us makes me seem like I'm trying to protect the group and find the truth. Directing my response to Selene shows I'm engaging with her accusation directly to appear genuine and concerned with clearing my name.
> **Ileana:** Selene, I understand your suspicion, but accusing me outright of lying is a bit hasty. Think about it - if Semira is indeed the Seer and saw what she claims, then the person I saw could very well have been the Minion trying to mislead me. We can't jump to conclusions without considering all the possibilities. For all we know, the real Werewolves could be using this contradiction to pit us against each other and cloud our judgment. Let's not fall into that trap.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** We need to hear from Dracula to assess his role and see if there are any contradictions or additional insights that can help us identify the werewolves. It's important to gather as much information as possible from all players.
> **Selene:** Dracula, what role do you claim to have? We need to piece together more information, and you've been quiet.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's claim directly contradicts Semira's assertion that both a Mason and a Villager are in the center. Resolving this contradiction is crucial to narrowing down the true roles and identifying potential Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, let's take a step back and think about the situations here. If Semira is telling the truth about seeing a Mason and a Villager in the center, then Ileana's claim of being a Mason and seeing another Mason is highly suspicious. This contradiction could be a deliberate ploy by a Werewolf or the Minion to create confusion. Ileana, can you explain yourself further? Why should we trust your claim over Semira's?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula is putting pressure on me to explain the contradiction, so I need to address him directly while still maintaining my innocence. By questioning why a Werewolf would make such an easily disprovable claim, I'm suggesting that the real Werewolves are more likely to be hiding and manipulating from the shadows. Casting doubt on Semira's claim and raising the possibility of Werewolf manipulation makes me seem like I'm trying to find the truth and protect the group. Framing it as a call for critical thinking and not accepting claims at face value positions me as a rational, unbiased player. This should help maintain my credibility while I figure out my next move.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, you raise a fair point about the contradiction between my claim and Semira's. But consider this - if I were truly a Werewolf, why would I make such an easily disprovable claim? It would only draw suspicion to myself. No, I genuinely believe I am a Mason and that the other Mason I saw could have been the Minion trying to deceive me. Semira, is there any chance you misinterpreted what you saw? Or could one of the Werewolves be manipulating this situation to sow doubt and confusion among us? We need to think critically and not just accept claims at face value.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Selene's strong insistence on Semira's claim being true is notable. By questioning her confidence, we might uncover more about her role and her trustworthiness in this situation.
> **Dracula:** Alright everyone, we've got quite a contradiction here between Semira and Ileana. Semira claims to have seen a Mason and a Villager in the center, while Ileana claims to be a Mason and saw another Mason last night. We need to clarify this contradiction because it's key to identifying the Werewolves. Selene, you seem very certain about Semira's information. Could you explain why you're so confident in her claim?


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** The contradiction between your claim and Semira's Seer information is too significant to ignore. Since I know for a fact that I am the only Mason, the other Mason card must be in the center, making your claim false and very suspicious.
> **Selene:** Ileana, I'm finding it very hard to believe your claim about being a Mason and seeing another Mason. Since we know that Semira saw a Mason card in the center, that means the only logical explanation is that you're lying. This makes you highly suspicious and potentially a Werewolf or the Minion trying to deceive us.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Selene's readiness to accuse me, I'm suggesting that she may have ulterior motives or be too quick to judge. This shifts the focus off of me and onto the reliability of Semira's claim. Proposing alternative explanations, like Semira being the Minion or simply mistaken, introduces doubt and makes my Mason claim seem more plausible. Dracula has been quiet, so drawing him into the discussion takes the pressure off of me and forces him to reveal information that I can potentially use. Overall, this approach allows me to appear rational and truth-seeking while subtly manipulating the conversation away from my potential guilt.
> **Ileana:** Selene, you seem awfully quick to accuse me based solely on Semira's claim. How can we be sure that Semira is telling the truth? For all we know, she could be the Minion trying to sow discord among the villagers by making a false claim. Or perhaps she genuinely believes she's the Seer but misinterpreted what she saw. We need to consider all possibilities before pointing fingers. Dracula, what are your thoughts on this? You've been rather quiet.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** This contradiction between Ileana and Semira is crucial. If Ileana is lying, she could be a Werewolf or the Minion. We need to get to the bottom of this to identify possible Werewolves.
> **Dracula:** I find it very suspicious that Ileana's claim of being a Mason contradicts Semira's claim of seeing a Mason in the center. This discrepancy needs to be addressed. Ileana, can you provide more details about your claim? Who did you see as the other Mason?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly naming Dragos as the Mason I supposedly saw, I'm putting the onus on him to either confirm or deny my claim. This bold move makes my Mason claim seem more credible, as a lying Werewolf would be less likely to make such a easily disprovable assertion. Asking Dragos to back me up pressures him to reveal information, which I can then use to either gain an ally or cast suspicion on him if he contradicts me. At the same time, suggesting that Semira may have made an honest mistake introduces doubt about her Seer claim without directly accusing her of lying. This allows me to undermine the evidence against me while appearing to be fair and truth-seeking. Altogether, this approach lets me steer the conversation, gather information, and create more uncertainty to conceal my true Werewolf identity.
> **Ileana:** Dracula, you ask a very pertinent question. The person I saw as the other Mason was Dragos. Dragos, can you please confirm that we both woke up and saw each other as Masons last night? I believe this will help clear up the contradiction and show that I'm telling the truth. Semira, is there any chance that in your drowsy state, you misinterpreted a Villager card for a Mason card? It's an easy mistake to make in the darkness of night.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Given that I am not a Mason, Ileana's claim of seeing me as one is a blatant lie. This casts serious doubt on her intentions and suggests she might be working against the village. By calling out her falsehood, I aim to bring clarity to the situation and pinpoint the potential threat.
> **Dragos:** Ileana, your claim of seeing me as a fellow Mason is completely false. I know for a fact that I am not a Mason. This makes me highly suspicious of you. It's clear that either you or Semira is lying. If Semira is indeed the Seer and saw a Mason in the center, then you must be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to deceive us.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dragos denying my Mason claim puts me in a tough spot, so I need to directly question his motives and reliability to shift suspicion off of myself. By expressing shock and suggesting he may be confused, mistaken, or even the Minion, I'm introducing doubt about his credibility. This makes my claim seem more plausible in comparison. Framing it as a general warning about deception helps position me as truth-seeking and concerned with protecting the group. Altogether, this approach allows me to undermine Dragos's contradiction of my claim while appearing rational and unbiased. It buys me time to assess my next move and keeps the target off my back for the moment.
> **Ileana:** Dragos, I'm shocked that you would deny our shared Mason experience. I clearly remember seeing you last night. Is it possible that you're the one who's confused or mistaken? Or worse, could you be the Minion trying to cast doubt on me to protect the Werewolves? Everyone, we need to be very careful about taking claims at face value. There's clearly deception at play here, and we must sift through it to find the truth.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Given that I am not a Mason, Ileana's claim of seeing me as one is a blatant lie. This casts serious doubt on her intentions and suggests she might be working against the village. By calling out her falsehood, I aim to bring clarity to the situation and pinpoint the potential threat.
> **Dragos:** Ileana, your claim of seeing me as a fellow Mason is completely false. I know for a fact that I am not a Mason. This makes me highly suspicious of you. It's clear that either you or Semira is lying. If Semira is indeed the Seer and saw a Mason in the center, then you must be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to deceive us.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly questioning Semira's claim and suggesting she may be mistaken or even the Minion, I'm casting doubt on the key piece of evidence against me. This shifts the focus off of my potential deception and onto the reliability of her information. Proposing an innocent explanation for the discrepancy, like a simple misinterpretation, makes my Mason claim seem more plausible. At the same time, hinting that she could be the Minion sows distrust and makes others question her motives. This approach allows me to undermine the accusation against me while appearing to be fair and truth-seeking. It buys me time to gather information and assess my next move, all while keeping the target off my back.
> **Ileana:** Semira, I find it very suspicious that you claim to have seen a Mason card in the center, yet I clearly remember waking up as a Mason and seeing Dragos. One of us must be lying or mistaken. Is it possible that in your drowsy state, you misinterpreted a Villager card for a Mason? Or could you be the Minion trying to mislead us? We need to get to the bottom of this discrepancy.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** I have to confront Ileana directly because her claim directly contradicts my verified information. If she's lying, she is likely trying to protect the Werewolves or create confusion as the Minion.
> **Semira:** Ileana, your story just doesn't add up. I am confident in what I saw as the Seer, and that was a Mason and a Villager in the center. There is no way you could have seen another Mason if the Mason card is in the center. This makes you highly suspicious, and I believe you are either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to deceive us.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directly questioning Selene's readiness to accuse me based on Semira's claim, I'm suggesting that she may be too quick to judge and not considering alternative explanations. This shifts the focus onto the reliability of Semira's supposed Seer information. Proposing that Semira could have simply made a mistake introduces doubt about the key evidence against me, making my Mason claim seem more plausible in comparison. At the same time, hinting that the Minion could be deceiving me sows uncertainty and makes the group question who they can trust. This approach allows me to undermine the accusation, appear rational and truth-seeking, and cast suspicion off myself while I figure out my next move.
> **Ileana:** Selene, you seem very quick to believe Semira's claim and accuse me of lying. But think about it - if I were really a Werewolf, why would I make such an easily disprovable claim about being a Mason and seeing Dragos? It would only draw suspicion to myself. No, I genuinely believe I am a Mason, and the only logical explanation is that the person I saw was the Minion trying to deceive me. We can't just blindly accept Semira's word without considering other possibilities. She could have easily misinterpreted what she saw in the dark of night.


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** I know for a fact that I'm the only Mason here, and Semira's Seer information supports this. Ileana's claim doesn't align with this, making her highly suspicious. We need to focus our attention on her.
> **Selene:** Alright, we have a clear contradiction here. Ileana claims to have seen another Mason, but Semira, who says she's the Seer, saw a Mason card in the center. Since I know the Mason card is in the center, Ileana must be lying. I'm strongly accusing Ileana of being a Werewolf or the Minion.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** We've heard conflicting claims from Semira and Ileana. To resolve this tension, it's crucial to understand where Dracula stands. His role could provide more clarity and help us identify whether Ileana or Semira is lying. If Dracula reveals something that aligns with Semira's claims, it would further discredit Ileana. Conversely, if Dracula's role supports Ileana's claim, we may need to reconsider Semira's information.
> **Semira:** Dracula, we need to hear from you directly. What's your role in this game?


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to clear up this contradiction and your input could be crucial in determining who is lying between Semira and Ileana. If you clarify your role, it might help us understand the situation better.
> **Dracula:** Dragos, you have been very quiet and seem to be playing both sides of the argument. What role do you claim to have?


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana's story has a major flaw because I know I'm not a Mason. If Semira is telling the truth about seeing a Mason in the center, that leaves Ileana being highly suspicious. By reinforcing Semira's claim and focusing on the contradiction, we can work together to identify the likely Werewolves or Minion.
> **Dragos:** Semira, I find it really odd that Ileana is claiming to be a Mason and saw me as the other Mason. Given that I know for a fact I am not a Mason and your Seer claim fits with that, I'm inclined to believe you more than her.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Ileana claims to have seen Dragos as the other Mason, and given that I saw a Mason card in the center as the Seer, Dragos's confirmation will help us determine who is lying. If Dragos denies being a Mason, it will further discredit Ileana's claim and strengthen the case against her.
> **Semira:** Dragos, can you please clarify your role for us? Ileana is claiming to have seen you as a Mason, but you haven't confirmed or denied your role directly. This information is critical to resolving the contradiction between Ileana's and my claims.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Dracula has yet to reveal his role or provide any substantial information, which makes it difficult to piece together the truth. By challenging him to reveal his role, we can gather more data to cross-reference with the existing claims and identify any potential Werewolves or Minions.
> **Dragos:** Dracula, you've been quite reserved in this discussion. Can you please clarify your role and explain why you haven't been more forthcoming? We need all the information we can get to resolve this contradiction.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Selene (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana's claim of being a Mason and seeing another Mason contradicts both my knowledge and Semira's Seer information. Since I know I am the only Mason and the other Mason card is in the center, Ileana must be lying. This makes her highly suspicious and likely a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Selene [Mason]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Semira (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I saw a Mason and a Villager in the center, which means Ileana's claim of being a Mason and seeing another Mason is false. Therefore, Ileana is highly suspicious and likely to be either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to deceive us.
> **Semira [Seer]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Dracula (thoughts as Villager):*** Semira, who claims to be the Seer, stated that she saw a Mason and a Villager in the center. If this is true, there can be no Masons among the players. Ileana's claim of being a Mason and seeing Dragos, who denies being a Mason, is highly suspect. This contradiction points strongly to Ileana either being a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead us. Therefore, voting for Ileana seems the most logical choice to unmask potential deception and win the game for the village team.
> **Dracula [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Dragos (thoughts as Villager):*** Ileana claims to be a Mason and saw me as the other Mason, but I know I am a Villager. Semira, who claims to be the Seer, saw a Mason card and a Villager card in the center. This directly contradicts Ileana's claim and makes her highly suspicious. Based on this information, I believe Ileana is either a Werewolf or the Minion trying to deceive us.
> **Dragos [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I'm voting for Semira because she has been the most assertive in accusing me of lying about being a Mason. Her supposed Seer claim directly contradicts my story, making her my biggest threat. By voting for her, I can cast doubt on the reliability of her information and paint her as suspicious. If she gets voted out, it eliminates the person most confidently challenging my claim. Even if she doesn't get eliminated, voting for her makes me appear less suspicious than if I voted for someone who hasn't accused me. It's the best strategic move to protect my Werewolf identity and sow confusion among the other players.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Semira.


The votes were:
* Semira : Seer : 1
* Ileana : Werewolf : 4



>***GAME:*** Ileana was killed. The villagers win.
