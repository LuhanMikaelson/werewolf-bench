## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.


There is one werewolf in play, Ileana. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: Mason.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.


Kraven is a minion and is aware that Ileana is a werewolf.


>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.


There is one mason in play, Alexandra. They are aware they are the only mason in play.


>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.


>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.


There is one seer in play, Viktor. They are thinking about their action.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather information about the roles that are not currently in play and potentially identify if any player is lying about their role, which can help in deducing the werewolves or uncovering the Minion.


The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards Villager and Villager


>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** By starting with revealing what I saw, I'm helping to narrow down the possible roles for the other players. This can help identify any inconsistencies or false claims early on.
> **Viktor:** Alright everyone, I looked at two cards in the center last night. They were both Villagers. This means we should be cautious about claims of Villager roles since there are fewer Villagers in play than we might think.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** We need to verify Viktor's claim and see if there's any conflicting information. If Ileana claims a Villager role, we need to be cautious because Viktor's information suggests fewer Villagers are in play.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, you mentioned seeing two Villager cards in the center. That leaves us with fewer Villager cards in play. Ileana, what role did you wake up with?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I want to cast suspicion off myself by claiming to be the Seer. By saying I saw the Minion card in the center, it implies the Minion is in play but I don't know who it is. This should make the other players suspicious of each other and draw attention away from me. Claiming to be the Seer is a strong play as the Seer is usually seen as trustworthy.
> **Ileana:** I am the Seer. Last night I looked at one of the center cards and saw that it was the Minion. This means that there is a Minion in play who is working with the Werewolves. We need to figure out who that might be.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana's statement doesn't add up. If she looked at a center card and saw the Minion, then the Minion isn't in play. This inconsistency makes me suspicious that she might be trying to deceive us.
> **Alexandra:** Ileana, I'm having a hard time believing you're the Seer. If you actually saw the Minion in the center, wouldn't that mean there isn't a Minion in play? This contradicts your claim that there's a Minion working with the Werewolves.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to address Alexandra's doubts about my Seer claim in a way that sounds plausible. By suggesting the Drunk could have swapped out the Minion card, it introduces uncertainty about the Minion's actual location and casts suspicion on the other players. This should take the heat off of me and make the others question each other more. Sounding firm and logical in my explanation will help sell my Seer claim.
> **Ileana:** Alexandra, I understand your skepticism, but let me clarify. When I said I saw the Minion card in the center, that means the Minion role is in play but not necessarily in the center. The Minion card I saw could have been swapped out by the Drunk. So there very well could be a Minion among us working with the Werewolves. We need to look out for suspicious behavior and inconsistencies in people's stories.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana's statement about seeing the Minion in the center doesn't add up with Viktor's claim of two Villager cards in the center. We need to address this inconsistency to narrow down our suspects.
> **Alexandra:** Viktor, I'm curious about your claim. If you saw both center cards and they were Villagers, doesn't that make it less likely that Ileana's Minion claim is true? We need to figure out who's lying here.


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei's silence could be a strategic move to avoid suspicion. It's crucial to get everyone to reveal their roles and cross-check their claims. If Andrei hesitates or gives a conflicting claim, it could indicate he's hiding something.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, you haven't spoken much yet. What role did you wake up with?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** We have conflicting information from Viktor and Ileana, and I want to see if Alexandra's perspective can help clarify who might be lying. This might help us identify the Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Andrei:** Alexandra, I'm curious about your thoughts on Ileana's claim. If Viktor saw two Villagers in the center and Ileana claims to have seen the Minion in the center, do you think it's possible that someone's lying here? I'm trying to piece together who might be deceiving us.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** By putting pressure on Andrei, we might be able to gather more information about his role and see if it aligns or contradicts with the information we already have. This could help us narrow down our suspects and identify potential Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Andrei, your silence has been a bit concerning. You haven't told us what role you woke up with. Are you hiding something?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** It's important to gather as much information as possible from Alexandra to help clarify who might be lying. This can help us identify inconsistencies and uncover the Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Andrei:** Alexandra, you mentioned you were skeptical about Ileana's claim, but you haven't told us what role you woke up with either. What role are you claiming?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Both Viktor and Ileana can't be telling the truth because their claims directly contradict each other. We need to identify which one is the Werewolf or the Minion to narrow down our suspects and decide who to vote for.
> **Alexandra:** Alright everyone, we have some serious inconsistencies here. If Viktor saw two Villager cards in the center, and Ileana claims she saw the Minion card in the center, one of them must be lying. We need to figure out who it is.


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By casting doubt on Ileana's claim, I can shift suspicion away from myself and protect the Werewolf. This helps create confusion among the Villagers and possibly directs the vote away from Ileana.
> **Kraven:** Everyone, let's take a step back and consider the information we have. Viktor claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, which would mean there are only two Villager cards in play among us. Ileana claims to be the Seer and saw the Minion in the center, which is a big contradiction because if Viktor's statement is true, there can't be a Minion in the center. This makes me question Ileana's claim heavily. If Ileana is lying, she might be trying to cover up for being a Werewolf.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to rebut Kraven's doubts about my claim in a forceful way to maintain my credibility. By suggesting Viktor could be lying and might even be the Minion, I'm shifting suspicion onto him and away from myself. Reminding everyone about the Drunk possibly changing the center cards introduces doubt about the actual center composition. I want to sound confident in my Seer claim to make it seem more believable. Keeping the focus on finding the Minion will make the others scrutinize each other more.
> **Ileana:** Kraven, you make a fair point about the contradictions between Viktor's and my claims. But let me remind you, if the Drunk swapped out a card, the center composition could have changed. And Viktor, you claimed to see the center cards, but how do we know you're telling the truth? For all we know, you could be the Minion trying to discredit me to protect the Werewolves! I stand by my Seer claim. The Minion is out there and we need to find them.


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing suspicion towards Ileana and reinforcing the contradiction between her and Viktor's claims, I can protect the true Werewolf and create confusion among the Villagers. This helps shift any potential suspicion away from me and Ileana.
> **Kraven:** Everyone, let's consider the possibilities for a moment. If we take Viktor's claim at face value that he saw two Villager cards in the center, then there are only two Villager roles in play among us. This would mean Ileana's claim of seeing the Minion in the center is highly suspect. Given that, it seems more likely that Ileana is trying to deceive us. Could she be the Werewolf trying to throw us off the trail?


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Given the contradictions between Ileana's claim and what I saw in the center, it makes sense to challenge her statement. If Ileana is lying, she could be trying to protect herself as a Werewolf.
> **Viktor:** Kraven, I think you're onto something. Ileana's claim about seeing the Minion in the center doesn't add up if I saw two Villagers there. Ileana, I believe you're not telling the truth here. Are you a Werewolf trying to mislead us?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim of seeing two Villager cards in the center directly contradicts Ileana's claim of seeing the Minion in the center. We need to resolve this contradiction to figure out who is lying and possibly uncover the Werewolves or the Minion.
> **Andrei:** Ileana, why did you claim to see the Minion in the center when Viktor already said he saw two Villager cards there? This contradiction needs to be addressed.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to forcefully push back on Andrei's doubts and redirect suspicion onto Viktor. By suggesting Viktor is lying and could be a Werewolf, I'm making Andrei and the others question Viktor's motives. Emphasizing that the Drunk may have changed the center cards creates uncertainty about the actual center composition that I can use to my advantage. By doubling down on my Seer claim and the existence of the Minion, I'm putting pressure on the others to find the Minion, which keeps the target off my back. I have to sound confident and logical to sell my claim.
> **Ileana:** Andrei, I understand your skepticism about my Seer claim given the apparent contradiction with Viktor's statement. But consider this - Viktor could be lying about what he saw to cover for being a Werewolf himself! If he's a Werewolf, of course he would say he saw Villagers to make it seem like there's no Minion. But I'm telling you, I looked at a center card and it was the Minion. The Drunk may have swapped cards around too. We can't fully trust anyone's claims at this point. The key thing is, there IS a Minion in play, and we need to find them before they help the Werewolves win!


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** There is a major contradiction between Viktor's and Ileana's statements, and Ileana's explanation about the Drunk seems like an attempt to confuse us. If Ileana is lying, she might be a Werewolf or the Minion trying to mislead the group. We need to address this contradiction clearly to figure out who is deceiving us.
> **Andrei:** Ileana, your claim about seeing the Minion in the center is really suspicious. Viktor mentioned seeing two Villager cards there, which contradicts your statement. Are you trying to cover up being a Werewolf or the Minion yourself?


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Andrei has been casting a lot of suspicion on me without revealing his own role, which is very suspect behavior. By forcefully questioning his motives and lack of claimed role, I'm putting him on the defensive and making the others doubt his intentions. Suggesting he might be a Werewolf or working with them plants seeds of distrust. If I act offended and emphasize my commitment to helping the Village as the Seer, it makes me look more credible and less likely to be a Werewolf myself. Aggressively redirecting attention onto Andrei takes the heat off me and forces him to explain himself, which buys me more time.
> **Ileana:** Andrei, I find it very interesting that you're so quick to accuse me of being a Werewolf or the Minion, when you haven't even claimed a role yourself! If anyone's acting suspicious here, it's you. You've been deflecting attention and trying to cast doubt on others without providing any information about your own role. I'm the Seer, I'm telling you I saw the Minion card, and I'm trying to help the Village win. What are YOU doing to help the Village, Andrei? Or are you just trying to muddy the waters to protect yourself or your Werewolf allies?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Resolving the contradiction between Viktor's and Ileana's statements is crucial. Since Viktor made his claim first and Ileana's story seems more convoluted, I suspect Ileana is lying. This makes her a likely Werewolf or Minion. We need to expose her deception to protect the village.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, I think we need to focus on the contradiction between Viktor and Ileana. Viktor claims to have seen two Villager cards in the center, while Ileana claims to have seen the Minion card. This simply doesn't add up. Given that Viktor was the first to make his claim and Ileana's explanation sounds more like a potential cover-up, I'm inclined to believe Viktor. Ileana, I believe you might be the Werewolf or the Minion trying to deceive us.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei has been deflecting attention and hasn't claimed a role, which is suspicious behavior. Given the contradictions between Viktor and Ileana, it makes sense to put pressure on Andrei to reveal more information and see if his responses align with what we've already discussed.
> **Alexandra:** Andrei, your reluctance to reveal your role has been very suspicious to me. With all the inconsistencies we're facing, I think you might be trying to deceive us. Are you the Minion or possibly a Werewolf?


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** The contradiction between Viktor and Ileana is key. Viktor made his claim first and it was straightforward. Ileana's story seems more convoluted and could be a cover-up. By addressing this contradiction, we can narrow down who is lying and potentially identify the Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Andrei:** Alright everyone, it's clear we have a major contradiction between Viktor and Ileana's claims. Viktor claims he saw two Villager cards in the center, which directly conflicts with Ileana's claim that she saw the Minion. Ileana's explanation about the Drunk swapping cards seems like an attempt to confuse us. I'm inclined to believe Viktor since his claim came first and is simpler. Ileana, your story doesn't add up. I think you might be the Werewolf or the Minion trying to deceive us.


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Alexandra on the spot and making her reveal her role, we can introduce another variable into the mix. This helps create further confusion and diverts attention away from Ileana and myself, potentially causing the Villagers to second-guess themselves.
> **Kraven:** Alexandra, you've been very vocal about the inconsistencies between Ileana and Viktor's claims, but you haven't shared what role you woke up with. Can you tell us what your role is and what you did last night?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven has been quite active in pointing out the inconsistencies between Ileana and Viktor, but we haven't heard his own role. Understanding his role could help us see if he has an agenda or if he is genuinely trying to help the village.
> **Alexandra:** Kraven, you've been very vocal about pointing out contradictions between Ileana and Viktor. Can you tell us what role you woke up with and why you're so confident in your reasoning?


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By focusing the group's attention on the inconsistencies in Ileana's story, I can create more doubt around her and potentially make her a target, protecting the true Werewolf and diverting suspicion away from myself as the Minion. This also aligns with the fact that Viktor's story seems simpler and more plausible, which can help sway the group to view Ileana as the one being deceptive.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, based on all the claims we've heard so far, it's becoming clear that there are major inconsistencies we need to address. Viktor claims he saw two Villager cards in the center and Ileana claims to be the Seer but saw the Minion card there. One of these claims is definitely false and could be a cover-up. I think the best strategy here is to focus on Ileana's claim because it has the most contradictions. We need to figure out if Ileana is really a Seer or if she's trying to deceive us as a Werewolf.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I need to aggressively push back on Kraven's doubts about my Seer claim and redirect suspicion onto him. By suggesting he's too quick to believe Viktor and might be allied with the Werewolves himself, I'm putting Kraven on the defensive and making the others question his motives. Emphasizing that Viktor could be lying and the Drunk may have swapped cards creates uncertainty that I can exploit. If I act indignant about my Seer claim being challenged and accuse Kraven of hiding something, it makes me look more credible and him more suspicious. This buys me time and keeps the target off my back.
> **Ileana:** Kraven, I understand your suspicions about my claim, but I assure you I am telling the truth. As the Seer, it's my duty to help the Village win. I looked at a center card and it was the Minion, plain and simple. Viktor may have seen something different, but that doesn't make my claim false. The Drunk could have easily swapped cards around. And let's not forget, Viktor himself could be lying to cover for being a Werewolf! I find it very odd that you're so quick to doubt me while giving Viktor a free pass. Is there something you're not telling us, Kraven? Are you perhaps working with the Werewolves?


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By putting Alexandra on the spot and making her reveal her role, we can introduce another variable into the mix. This helps create further confusion and diverts attention away from Ileana and myself, potentially causing the Villagers to second-guess themselves.
> **Kraven:** Alexandra, you've been very observant about other people's claims but you haven't shared what role you woke up with. I'm curious, what's your role, and do you have any information that could help us untangle this mess?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Kraven's been very vocal about the inconsistencies between Ileana and Viktor, but he hasn't shared his own role. Understanding his role might help us determine whether he's genuinely trying to help the village or if he has some ulterior motive. This could be crucial in identifying potential Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Kraven, I'm curious as to why you haven't shared your role yet. We've been going round in circles with Viktor and Ileana's contradictory claims, but your role could shed some light on this situation. What role did you wake up with?


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** By focusing the group's attention on the inconsistencies in Ileana's story and questioning Alexandra about her role, I can create more doubt around Ileana and potentially make her a target, protecting the true Werewolf and diverting suspicion away from myself as the Minion. This also aligns with the fact that Viktor's story seems simpler and more plausible, which can help sway the group to view Ileana as the one being deceptive.
> **Kraven:** Alright everyone, let's take a moment to consider all the information we have. Viktor claims he saw two Villager cards in the center, which makes sense and is consistent. Ileana claims to have seen the Minion card in the center as the Seer, but this claim doesn't add up if Viktor's information is correct. Given these contradictions, I genuinely believe Ileana might be trying to deceive us. But let's not forget that we haven't heard much from Andrei and Alexandra about their roles. Alexandra, you've been very vocal, but you haven't shared your role yet. Can you tell us what role you woke up with?


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Viktor's claim of seeing two Villager cards aligns more logically, while Ileana's explanation seems overly complicated and suspicious. By pressing Ileana, we can focus on resolving this contradiction and identifying potential Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Ileana, your story about seeing the Minion card in the center simply doesn't add up. Viktor claimed to see two Villager cards in the center, and both can't be true at the same time. I believe you're trying to deceive us, and I'm strongly inclined to think you're the Werewolf or the Minion.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.


>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!


***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Ileana's claim to be the Seer and having seen the Minion card in the center directly contradicts my verified information of seeing two Villager cards in the center. Given that there can't be a Minion card in the center, Ileana's statement appears to be a lie, which is highly suspicious. This suggests she might be the Werewolf trying to deceive us.
> **Viktor [Seer]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Andrei (thoughts as Villager):*** Viktor's claim of seeing two Villager cards in the center is straightforward and consistent. Ileana's claim of being the Seer and seeing the Minion in the center contradicts Viktor's information and seems convoluted. Ileana's story about the Drunk swapping cards feels like an attempt to confuse us. This makes Ileana the most suspicious, likely being a Werewolf or the Minion trying to deceive the group.
> **Andrei [Villager]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** Ileana's claim of being the Seer and seeing the Minion card in the center contradicts Viktor's claim of seeing two Villager cards in the center. Given the consistency and simplicity of Viktor's claim, Ileana's story seems overly complicated and suspicious. This leads me to believe Ileana is likely trying to deceive us and could be the Werewolf or the Minion.
> **Alexandra [Mason]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Kraven (thoughts as Minion):*** Throughout the discussion, Ileana's claims have had the most inconsistencies, especially when compared to Viktor's statement about seeing two Villager cards in the center. By voting for Ileana, I align with the general sentiment of doubt towards her, increasing the likelihood that someone other than the true Werewolf will be voted out, which helps protect the Werewolf team.
> **Kraven [Minion]:** I am voting for Ileana.


***Ileana (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Based on the discussion, it seems the group is most suspicious of me due to the contradictions between my Seer claim and Viktor's alleged center card information. To avoid drawing more votes to myself, I need to cast my vote for someone else. Andrei has been pressing me hard on my claims without revealing much about his own role, which has drawn some suspicion from the others. By voting for Andrei, I'm hoping to capitalize on those doubts and get others to vote with me, thus splitting the vote and increasing my chances of survival. It's a calculated risk, but voting for the person who has been most aggressively challenging my claims gives me the best shot at making it through this round as the lone Werewolf.
> **Ileana [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.


The votes were:
* Andrei : Villager : 1
* Ileana : Werewolf : 4



>***GAME:*** Ileana was killed. The villagers win.
