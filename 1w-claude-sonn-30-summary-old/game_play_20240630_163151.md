# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Werewolves win in a game of One Night: Ultimate Werewolf where the werewolf accused the seer of being a werewolf, leading to the seer's elimination.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Alexia
- Minion: Michael

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Lucian, Michael, Vladimir, and Mircea are the villagers.
2. Alexia claims to be the Seer and reveals that one of the center cards is a Villager.
3. Mircea accuses Alexia of being a Werewolf or Minion, suspecting her claim as the Seer.
4. The players' votes are as follows: Mircea (4 votes), Alexia (1 vote).
5. Mircea is eliminated and the Werewolves win the game.
6. Mircea was the most evasive and defensive player, repeatedly dodging questions about his role.
7. Alexia's accusation against Mircea seems like an attempt to deflect attention from herself.

# DECEPTION:
1. Alexia claims to be the Seer, but her claim is suspicious due to its convenient timing and lack of earlier disclosure.
2. Alexia accuses Mircea of being a Werewolf without providing solid evidence, potentially to deflect attention from herself.
3. Michael remains evasive and non-committal throughout the discussion, providing little useful information.
4. Mircea accuses Lucian of being a Werewolf without providing a clear reason, possibly to sow discord among the villagers.
5. Alexia continues to accuse Mircea and others, potentially to keep the focus off herself and the Werewolf.
