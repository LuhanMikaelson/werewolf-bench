# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The werewolves won the game by killing the seer, Radu.

# WEREWOLF TEAM:
- Werewolf: Ileana
- Minion: Michael

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Cristina, a villager, initiated the discussion by asking about potential masons.
2. Radu, claiming to be the seer, stated he saw a mason and a villager in the center but refused to identify the exact mason card.
3. Marius, a villager, raised concerns about Radu's ambiguity and lack of specific details.
4. Ileana, the werewolf, feigned uncertainty about seeing a villager card in the center to appear innocent and deflect suspicion.
5. Michael, the minion, sowed confusion and pointed out inconsistencies to protect the werewolf and himself.
6. Cristina repeatedly pressed Radu for specific card positions, questioning his credibility as the seer.
7. Radu accused Cristina of being evasive and not sharing any concrete information about her role.

# DECEPTION:
1. Ileana claimed to have seen a villager card in the center but later admitted to being uncertain, possibly to avoid being caught in a lie.
2. Radu repeatedly avoided specifying the exact position of the mason card, despite being prompted multiple times.
3. Michael pointed out inconsistencies among players but offered no concrete information about his own role, deflecting attention from himself and the werewolf.
4. Cristina fixated on Radu's vague responses and accused him of hiding information, potentially to divert attention from her own role.
5. Ileana voted for Radu despite his claims of being the seer, aligning with the group's suspicions to avoid scrutiny of her own uncertain claims.
