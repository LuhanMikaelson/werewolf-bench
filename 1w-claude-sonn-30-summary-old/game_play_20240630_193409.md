# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Werewolves won the game, killing Ileana, who was the Minion.

# Werewolf Team:
- Werewolf: Marius
- Minion: Ileana

# MAIN POINTS:
- Dracula, the Seer, saw Cristina's card and confirmed her as a Mason.
- Cristina and Andrei confirmed each other as Masons.
- Marius claimed to be the Minion and accused Ileana of being the Werewolf.
- Ileana consistently tried to discredit Marius's claim and redirect suspicion onto him.
- Dracula, Cristina, and Andrei voted for Ileana, while Ileana and Marius voted for themselves.
- The vote resulted in 3 votes for Ileana and 2 votes for Marius, eliminating Ileana.

# DECEPTION:
- Marius claimed to be the Minion but accused Ileana of being the Werewolf, which contradicted the Minion's role.
- Ileana deflected suspicion onto Marius and tried to cast doubt on his claim without providing a solid defense for her own role.
- Marius challenged Ileana to provide a defense and appealed to Dracula to confirm his accusation, putting pressure on Ileana.
- Ileana attempted to portray herself as a Villager and accused Marius of creating confusion, but her evasive behavior and lack of evidence raised suspicion.
