## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:

The villagers won a game of One Night Ultimate Werewolf after correctly identifying and voting out the werewolf player.

## WEREWOLF TEAM:

Emil - Werewolf
Radu - Minion

## MAIN POINTS:

1. Cristina and Dragos claimed to be Masons and could vouch for each other, but their claims put doubt on Selene's claim to be the Seer.
2. Emil aggressively accused Dragos and Cristina without solid evidence and tried to deflect suspicion onto Selene.
3. Emil's inconsistencies and aggressive behavior made him the most suspicious player.
4. Selene's hesitancy to share her vision as the Seer created doubt about her role.
5. Radu remained mostly silent and avoided committing to a role, making him appear suspicious.
6. The vote was split between Emil and Selene, with Emil receiving four votes and Selene receiving one.
7. Emil was killed, and the villagers won.

## DECEPTION:

1. Emil accused Dragos of being a Werewolf without providing evidence.
2. Emil tried to shift suspicion onto Selene by accusing her of being the Seer and not sharing her vision.
3. Emil's aggressive behavior and inconsistent accusations were a classic tactic of a Werewolf trying to deflect attention.
4. Radu remained silent and avoided committing to a role, which could have been a strategy to avoid suspicion.
5. Selene's hesitation to share her vision as the Seer raised concerns about her role.
